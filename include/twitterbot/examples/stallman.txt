     Richard Stallman's Personal Page        It's the Grav-Mass season! Grav-Mass is the celebration of physical laws. December 25 Isaac Newton's birthday. &iexcl;Feliz Gravidad!    -->     Today we commemorate the September 11 attacks, which killed President Allende of Chile and installed Pinochet's murderous military dictatorship. More than 3,000 dissidents were killed or "disappeared" by the Pinochet regime. The USA operated a destabilization campaign in Chile, and the September 11 attacks were part of that campaign.   I also support a  new investigation of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the US.  -->  Richard Stallman's Personal Site    Political Articles | Political Notes | Travel Experiences | Travel Photos | Fiction | Books | Sayings | Personal Ad | Humor | Non-Political Articles | RMS personal FAQ | GPG Key | Scientific Links | Airlines | Serious Bio | Humorous Bio | Comics | Photos and Drawings of Me | Speaking Schedule | Empire of the Megacorporations | There Ought to Be a Law | Links | Archive | Thanks |       Site search:   advanced  Send comments/questions about the search engine to: rms at gnu dot org    What's bad about: Amazon | Apple | Facebook | Skype | Google | Uber | Ebooks | Amtrak   RSS site feed for the most recent political notes and new material.

There Ought to Be a Law   No sports team can receive a  subsidy from any US jurisdiction, and that include's the team's stadium or other facilities.    Fixing too big to fail.   Companies that are among the ten largest in any market should not be allowed to merge &mdash; period.   Any company that wants to use genetically modified organisms other than in research should be required to get a license from the state. One condition of the license should be a requirement to answer (for publication) any and all questions posed by regulators about the organisms, their planned use, and the experiments done on them. Thus, any aim of the company to keep secrets about them will be categorically rejected in advance.   If a company has changed its name within the past 5 years, or if a substantial part of it was acquired from another company, it should be legally required to include a statement with the old name in all its publications, announcements, and paid publicity. This would foil  companies like Blackwater and Philip Morris that change their names to escape the odium of their past deeds.   Quotes  Here are some  quotations that I particularly like.

If you live in or have confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at gnu.org.  Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, UK, the Philippines. Australia's previous government tried to institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped the plan. India is now trying to institute national ID cards.  Support the campaign against them. Austria doesn't require people to have a national ID card, but requires people to notify the police of where they are staying even for 3 days. Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional, but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.  Denmark and Iceland don't have ID cards as such, but they have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently. For example, in Iceland the national ID number is often required to rent a video or use a gym.   Wikipedia has a list of identity card policies by country.   Borders  Stay away from certain countries because of their bad immigration policies.   Flight connections  Avoid flight connections in these airports because of their  treatment of passengers.   The Lifelong Activist  People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for years without burning out. The best way I can answer is by recommending a book,  The Lifelong Activist by Hillary Rettig. I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as being marketing and sales, because those terms refer to business, and politics is something much more important than mere business. However, this doesn't diminish the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing techniques from marketing and sales. Disclosure: I am friends with the author.

The Knife- Stupid Airport Security Tricks   What Should the US do in Iraq?   Biopiracy or Bioprivateering? (Spanish translation, French translation, and, German translation.   The states need to form a union.   A slightly revised version of an article that appeared in Salon Magazine on 11 September 2002.   Dear President Musharraf...   On July 22, Israel killed a Hamas leader, Salah Shaheda, who was in charge of many Hamas attacks.   Is the US killing many Afghan civilians to save one US soldier?   Political fencing in Israel.   I got a message with a series of points criticizing Americans for blaming companies and institutions rather than themselves. I partly agree with the underlying message that people should take charge and solve problems, rather than just cast blame on others. However, the points go too far&mdash;they whitewash companies and institutions that really did something wrong.   British book publishers plan to put a microchip into every book to record who owns it &mdash; an unprecedented surveillance measure. Given the publishers' opposition to such institutions as free lending libraries and used book stores, we must suspect that this scheme is aimed at them. Will they try to collect a fee every time a used book is resold, as part of storing the new owner's name on the chip?   Good Fences Make Good Neighbors. I was shocked to learn recently that there is no border fence dividing Israel from the occupied Palestinian territories. The reason is that expansionists want to annex these territories permanently. In their eyes, a fence would be an admission that those territories are not part of Israel, so they won't allow it.   When President Chavez of Venezuela was ousted in a military coup, newspaper coverage in the US hinted that Chavez was mentally unstable. He thought he could make his country independent of the IMF. He thought that the generals of his Venezuela would be loyal to Venezuela instead of Washington. A man would have to be crazy to believe such things&mdash;or would he?   When police say "No witnesses", one must suspect they are up to some kind of dirty work that they don't want to admit to the public. An encounter in a Paris airport.   Human Rights in the US, and in China. The Chinese government has released a report detailing human rights violations in the US. The abuses include torture of detainees by police, sometimes resulting in death. All governments should be pressured to correct their abuses of human rights; from Bolivia to Spain, from the US to China, no government should escape.   Someone to watch over me. Nowadays, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean you aren't really under surveillance.   Stopping terrorists before they start. Making sure that the CIA does not create new enemies to attack us tomorrow surely deserves high priority in any sincere "War on Terrorism".   Bush has proposed a large increase in military spending, including pay raises for soldiers, reserves to cover the expenses of possible combat, unmanned vehicles, and ballistic missile defense. Some of these make sense, more or less &mdash; but ballistic missile defense? It's clear what is happening here: Bush is at his old tricks.   The Injustice of Military Courts. Bush has a plan to try alleged terrorists in  military courts&mdash;-courts where the prosecutor, the defense lawyer, and the judges all work for Bush. If we could only be sure that the accused are really guilty, shoddy trials would not matter&mdash;we wouldn't need trials at all. But accusations against innocent people happen with terrible regularity, and the danger of false convictions is immense.   Police State Minus One Day And Counting. In late October Congress signed an anti-terrorism bill that undermined basic protections against police intrusion. It also attacks freedom of assembly. This article was originally published on Newsforge the day before the bill (S.1510) was passed. The only proposed provision that Congress rejected was that for indefinite detention of noncitizens without trial; Bush then proposed military trials as a way to get the same job done.   Who watches the watchmen? Whenever police ask to be allowed to bypass search warrants, we must be on guard. First published on Newsforge.   If we are not careful, the deadly attacks on New York and Washington will lead to far worse secondary damage, if the U.S. Congress adopts "preventive measures" that take away the freedom that America stands for. Thousands are dead &mdash; but millions could be deprived of civil liberties. First published on Newsforge.   While traveling from South Africa to Sweden in June, I became a victim of the War on Drugs. First published on Newsforge.   Science must "push copyright aside." Written for a debate about electronic access to scientific literature. First published 8 June 2001.   The antidemocratic suppression of public protest is now a standard part of the effort to impose antidemocratic trade treaties.   Waiting for the Knock, an article about Britain's plans for secret police raids to seize decryption keys. First published in the Guardian (London), 25 November 1999.  Sad to say, this law was adopted in Britain in July 2000. Residents of the UK must now start using steganography to protect themselves from secret raids.   Although generally supportive of President Hugo Chávez, Stallman has criticised some policies on television broadcasting, free speech rights, and personal privacy rights, in meetings with Chávez and in public speeches in Venezuela.    Political notes   "Those who profess to favor freedom, yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will."

Celebrate Grav-Mass       Check out the daily Political Notes.   Merry Grav-Mass!  Here is a  video Grav-Mass greeting.     On December 25, Isaac Newton's birthday, we celebrate the existence of comprehensible physical laws. Remember, Gravitation is a well-established scientific theory, but  Intelligent Falling is just religion pretending to be science.   Here's a gallery of Grav-Mass cards that you can contribute to.   One way to celebrate Grav-Mass is to decorate a tree with apples and other fruits. Glue them or attach them, but not too well! The idea is that occasionally a fruit should fall. Put them on the tree no more than 2 feet up, so that they won't get damaged or hurt anybody when they fall. Investigating and perfecting the methods for doing this is a great way expose a child to the process of scientifically studying the behavior of the physical world.   Another way to celebrate Grav-Mass, in a group, is by telling each other about scientific knowledge and understanding, or discussing what kind of experiment could answer an unresolved question about the world.   We have one Grav-Mass carol, We Three Laws. If you know of any others, please tell me about them: rms at gnu dot org. Other songs about science are also suitable to play or sing on Grav-Mass;  The Symphony of Science. The Ten Days of Newton.  Also,  The Galaxy Song by Monty Python. (And some  commentaries on it.)

On Dec 19, 2012, I opened an envelope and saw what I believe was the first Grav-Mass card ever made. It was made and sent to me by Simon and Jane Whiteley.

This suggests they would be glad to have the chance for a government that won't repress them. The problem is where that could come from.  28 October 2014 (Australian plan to "protect" the Great Barrier Reef)  The Australian plan to "protect" the Great Barrier Reef ignores the damage that global heating will do.  28 October 2014 (Turning old camera phones into remote surveillance cameras)  A company wants to pay people to turn old camera phones into remote surveillance cameras.  How is this different from stationing a human there to count people? They couldn't afford to station humans full time in very many places. And if they argue that they don't or can't recognize individuals, what assurance do we have that they won't be recognizing individuals using the same technique 10 years from now?  I think it should be illegal to set up a camera looking for more than a short time at a place where the public is admitted, if it makes the video remotely accessible. Individuals, and especially the state, should have to get a court order before they can do this.  28 October 2014 (Voting by email)  New Jersey's emergency experiment with voting by email ran into various practical problems in addition to the fundamental ones you'd expect, and there is no way of knowing how many votes were lost.  It is amusing how the artificial concern with voter fraud, stoked to provide a basis for stopping poor and disabled people from voting, is not applied to internet voting.  28 October 2014 (Fear of Ebola)  Fear of Ebola elicits bizarre reactions.  Hoax news contributes to the panic.  Ironically, Ebola is being used to spread computer viruses. But they probably can't hurt you if you are running GNU/Linux.  28 October 2014 (When foreign fighters want to leave PISSI)  When foreign fighters want to leave PISSI, it holds them prisoner and threatens to kill them.  Meanwhile, when Britons who went to Syria to fight against Assad go home because they don't support PISSI, the UK puts them in prison.  28 October 2014 (Capturing and centralizing the internet)  Giant web site companies are capturing and centralizing the internet, so that now 30 companies generate half the traffic in the US. They are converting it primarily into a broadcast medium.  I almost never access those companies' sites. In my view, the only good use of the internet is what they don't do.  Fortunately there is still enough of that to make a big difference from what the world was like before the internet.  28 October 2014 (Urgent: Oppose plan to make money laundering easier)  US citizens: oppose the Republican plan to make money laundering easier so as to help dishonest payday loan companies that make phony loans.  More information.  28 October 2014 (Unusual behavior on Amtrak)  On Amtrak, almost any unusual behavior is considered "suspicious" and is grounds for filing a report, perhaps arresting you, and perhaps stealing your money.  In practice it rarely happens to whites.  28 October 2014 (Compare US reaction)  Compare the US reaction to killings of US citizens by Israelis and by Palestinians.  27 October 2014 (UK slumlords)  UK slumlords evict tenants for complaining about unhealthy conditions.  27 October 2014 (Least religious generation in US history)  The US millennial generation is the least religious generation in US history. Churches are shrinking, and in the long term, the theocratic Christian right-wing is going to get weaker.  In effect, this election is the Christian fanatics' last chance at grabbing political power, and if they get it, the only way they can hold on to it is by denying the vote to those who will later take it away from them.  27 October 2014 (Silencing any view is tyranny)  Silencing Extreme Views, Even If They Are Those of Internet Trolls, Is Wrong.  It is not just wrong, it is tyranny.  27 October 2014 (Financial and technical "disruptions")  Financial "disruption" and technical "disruption" work together to track more, control more, and charge more.  27 October 2014 (UK's university system)  The UK's university system remains better than the US system in one way: the payments made by graduates depend on their incomes.  My main motive for going to college was fascination for learning. I hardly thought about making money afterward; I assumed I would become a professor but I rarely thought that far ahead. It was easy in the US in the 60s and 70s to follow an artistic or scholarly fascination and let income take care of itself, because the US still allowed most people a share in its income.  We should not blame today's students for giving high priority to their careers after they graduate, but the fact that they do so is a disadvantage for society. It will change when we get rid of plutocracy.  27 October 2014 (Authoritarian regime in Egypt)  In Egypt, an Authoritarian Regime Holds Sway Again.  27 October 2014 (Loss of Arctic ice)  The loss of Arctic ice has made severe winters in Eurasia twice as likely as before.  27 October 2014 (Woman executed in Iran)  A woman in Iran was executed for killing a man that she said was trying to rape her.  I believe her claim, especially since there was no other plausible account of what happened.  26 October 2014 (Right to sue)  1/3 of the most popular US web sites make users give up the right to sue over various sorts of mistreatment.  States should be prohibit this practice, but until they do, people should refuse to use sites that try to escape justice.  26 October 2014 (Many Britons switching to Green Party)  Many Britons are fed up with the right-wing Labour Party and are switching to the Green Party.  26 October 2014 (Local thug departments collecting people's phone call records)  Local thug departments in Virginia are collecting people's phone call records and redistributing them.  26 October 2014 (Apple's random hardware address)  Apple announced that iThings would randomize the WiFi hardware address to protect privacy, but it tuns out to do this only in unusual circumstances.  26 October 2014 (UK proposes a vague law)  The UK proposes a vague law to imprison computer users that "damage national security", including whistleblowers.  It is idiotic to pass a law against "using computers to do XYZ". If XYZ should be crime, what difference does it make whether it is done with a computer, with a pen, or however it might be?  26 October 2014 (Obama can work with Republicans just fine)  Obama can work with Republicans just fine when it comes to suppressing information about torture by the US government.  26 October 2014 (Fracking near New York State's Seneca lake)  Protesters blocked fracking near New York State's Seneca lake, which is a source of drinking water.  26 October 2014 (Europe's greenhouse gas pledge)  Greenpeace and other environmental groups say that Europe's greenhouse gas pledge is shamefully weak.  26 October 2014 (UK gov't spied on history professors)  The UK government spied on history professors who were members of the Communist party, even reading their mail, with no reason to suspect them of having anything but an opinion.  It spied on various academics and writers just because they agreed to a statement against nuclear weapons.  26 October 2014 (UK thugs repress protests)  UK thugs repress protests near Parliament to the point of arresting people for passing around bottles of water.  They are forced to hand over pizza boxes because the thugs say they might be useful for sleeping.  26 October 2014 (Time period of yellow lights)  The sleazy government of Chicago shortened the time period of yellow lights in order to trap motorists into more fines.  26 October 2014 (Gyroscopes in mobile phones)  Gyroscopes in mobile phones are so sensitive that they can pick up the sound of nearby voices. This allows apps to eavesdrop even if they are not allowed to use the microphone.  Note that this is a separate issue from conversion of phones into listening devices, which the NSA and other entities can do through the phone's universal back door. Thus, this facility doesn't make the phone more of a listening device than it was; but it does allow more parties to use it as a listening device.  26 October 2014 ('Koch Congress')  'Koch Congress' Could Make Oligarchy Official.  26 October 2014 (Protect us from&hellip;what?)  The NSA has to listen to everything to protect us from&hellip;what?  (The part I'm referring to is the first 8 slides. After that comes very technical material.)  The Committee to Protect Journalists says that US government resistance to encryption endangers journalists.  That is true, but the first and broadest danger to journalists comes from metadata: tracking who talks with whom.  26 October 2014 (Prison for cartoon)  A man in the UK has been sentenced for prison for having a cartoon depicting a fictional child in some sort of sexual situation.  The advocates of this kind of censorship started by saying they were trying to protect real children from being abused in order to take their photos. Making such photos should be a crime, and is a crime, but that is no reason to prohibit possessing copies of the photos.  However, they have already gone far beyond that. No child was harmed in drawing the cartoon.  To criminalize possession of copies of anything published &mdash; no matter what it is &mdash; is oppressive, and leads to many other forms of tyranny.  26 October 2014 (Pennsylvania's prisoner-gagging law)  Pennsylvania's prisoner-gagging law seems to be aimed first of all to gag Mumia abu-Jamal.  26 October 2014 (Urgent: Stop collection of your data)  US citizens: announce your general support for campaigning against collecting your data.  26 October 2014 (Fanatics threaten activist with death)  An activist set up events for Malaysians to get used to petting dogs, and is now getting death threats from religious fanatics.  26 October 2014 (Islamist rebels in Egypt)  Islamist rebels in Egypt have a persistent campaign of attacking Egyptian soldiers.  These rebels deserve condemnation for seeking to impose the rules of their religion on everyone, which tramples their human rights.  However, when al-Sisi calls them "terrorists", that is a lie. Terrorism means attacking civilians; attacking soldiers or state institutions is rebellion.  Al-Sisi calls even peaceful opposition "terrorism".  26 October 2014 (US media exploiting Ebola)  US media are trying to exploit Ebola by spreading panic about anyone who might have come anywhere near it.  This is having political results already from politicians that want to look tough.  Americans interested in helping to treat sick people in Africa will now either (1) return home through some other place or (2) decide not to go.  These people should take precautions, but it isn't necessary to lock them up, costing them their jobs and perhaps making them homeless afterward.  26 October 2014 ('Moral slide' of intel agencies)  MI6 Whistleblower's Partner Accuses Intelligence Agencies of 'Moral Slide'.  26 October 2014 (CIA torture report delays)  Frustrated CIA Blames Torture Report Delays on Senators Who Want It To Be Intelligible.  The right thing for the senators to do is to publish what they see fit and tell the CIA to jump in the lake. And then start a new Church Committee investigation that will tear the CIA open from top to bottom. You can't stop its abuses while handling it with kid gloves.  26 October 2014 (Liberian burial rituals)  People in Liberia are clinging to traditional burial rituals to the point of killing their relatives and killing themselves.  They kill their relatives by denying them treatment for whatever disease they have. They kill themselves by washing and handling the bodies of the dead, some of whom died of Ebola.  They are acting like idiots, but they don't deserve the consequence that they are bringing on themselves.  26 October 2014 (PISSI chemical weapons accusations)  There are accusations that PISSI has used chemical weapons on a few occasions on a small scale.  I have to wonder: since Saddam Hussein destroyed his chemical weapons, how did any survive.  26 October 2014 (Fanatics demand punishment of journalists)  Muslim fanatics in Afghanistan demand the punishment of journalists who wrote an article that they believe criticizes their religion.  Shame on anyone whose religion includes believing people are not allowed to insult it.  26 October 2014 (Not enough jobs in the UK)  The UK government is classifying thousands of people with incurable degenerative diseases as "likely to be able to work again soon".  Even if some Britons only pretend to be disabled, why bother to "catch" them? There aren't enough jobs in the UK for all the people who are looking for work. There aren't enough jobs in the UK to start pushing wages up.  26 October 2014 (EU's new CO2 emissions target)  The EU's new target for reduced CO2 emissions is considered a weak target by environmentalists.  26 October 2014 (Urgent: Stop lobbying against solar power)  Everyone: tell the owners of Walmart to stop lobbying against installation of home solar power.  I think this is one additional reason not to buy from Walmart. I never get anything there.  26 October 2014 (Massive protests continue in Mexico)  Mexico is still having massive protests about the disappearance of 43 protesting students.  26 October 2014 (Political control of South Florida)  Parts of South Florida want to split off from Florida and form a new state to get rid of the political control of global heating deniers. One more foot of sea level rise will destroy the water supply and sewage systems of South Florida.  25 October 2014 (Armed drones used for policing)  Armed drones used for policing could threaten human rights.  I agree, but there is one countervailing factor. Soldiers and thugs can use rubber-coated steel bullets and tear-gas canisters to kill by intentionally shooting them at people's heads. A drone operated by a human through remote control would not enable such accurate shooting.  25 October 2014 ("Sex offenders" forced to be homeless)  In Miami-Dade County, hundreds of people labeled as "sex offenders" are forced to be homeless because every available living space is covered by the areas where they are forbidden to live.  The US is extremely energetic about labeling people as "sex offenders" which means they are punished in many ways for the rest of their lives.  25 October 2014 (US atrocities in Viet Nam)  The US government has a PR campaign to cover up the atrocities in Viet Nam and make that unjust war appear glorious. It wants to bury the fact that atrocities by US forces were commonplace.  "You can't separate this effort to justify the terrible wars of 50 years ago from the terrible wars of today."  25 October 2014 (Manipulation of stock prices)  US corporations manipulate their stock prices by buying back shares. Some companies borrow money to do this, which over time puts the company in greater debt. Others are sitting on piles of uninvested cash and can do this without borrowing.  25 October 2014 (Murder confessions in Thailand)  The Burmese migrants that confessed to a murder in Thailand say that the thugs threatened to kill them and dump them if they didn't confess.  25 October 2014 (Rana Plaza factory collapse)  The survivors and relatives of the workers killed in the collapse of the Rana Plaza factories have only begun to get compensation.  What is really needed is an end to the business-controlled globalization that lets multinational companies make states such as Bangladesh compete to allow the worst exploitation of workers. Let's replace it with a new form of worker-focused globalization, in which countries legislate that "If you sell goods here, the factories that make them must pay and treat workers according to our standards, no matter where they are working."  25 October 2014 (The Love Commandos)  The Love Commandos in India protect couples who run away from families that want to force them to marry others.  25 October 2014 (UK wildlife habitat protection)  On land and now on sea, the organizations responsible for protecting wildlife habitat in the UK have become friendly with the industries that destroy it.  25 October 2014 (Japanese gov't corruption scandals)  Several corruption scandals have hit the Japanese government.  25 October 2014 (Russian media censorship)  Russian journalists must now operate from Latvia due to Russian media censorship.  Will we see Australian journalists operating from Indonesia due to Australian media censorship?  25 October 2014 (Censorship of US prisoners)  Pennsylvania has passed a law allowing arbitrary censorship of public statements by prisoners and even former prisoners.  The US government led the way for this with its censorship of testimony about prisoners in Guantanamo about how they were tortured.  24 October 2014 (Urgent: Nuclear Negotiations)  US citizens: call on prominent Democrats to support nuclear  negotiations with Iran.   24 October 2014 (Misogyny)  The internet is crawling with misogyny, and any woman doing something controversial is likely to be attacked by  posted threats of violence. The examples cited in this article seem sick and twisted to me, but the worst thing I find in it is the assumption that women who are raped, or even seen semi-nude, have something to be ashamed of. That's the explicit assumption of the Indian rapists that make videos of the act, as well as their victim who was interviewed. She expects people to condemn and shun her if they know she was raped. People who do that are committing the most basic injustice. We can see this attitude in the firing, by an elite Canadian high school, of a drama teacher because who made  porn films in 1970. (She is now 73 years old.) What, the administrators ask, will today's high school students think from knowing their teacher made porn 45 years ago? Perhaps "Older generations were just like us"? Or perhaps, "Our administration wants women to be weak and susceptible to misogyny"?   24 October 2014 (Herbicide) Earthjustice and farmers have sued to block  use of 2,4-D herbicide (best known as part of the toxic Agent Orange that the US dropped on Vietnam).   24 October 2014 (Energy)  The EU has adopted the target of cutting greenhouse  gas emissions by 40% by 2030.  It is an ambitious target, but it lacks firm measures to achieve the goal. Meanwhile, Australia plans a new policy for boosting fossil fuel  investment and holding back growth of renewable energy.    24 October 2014 (Wisconsin)  The Republican candidate for attorney general of Wisconsin wants criminal  investigation laws changed to give politicians special privilege.   24 October 2014 (Obama) Is Obama Stalling Until Republicans Can Bury the CIA Torture Report?  24 October 2014 (BBC)  The BBC presented a documentary accusing the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front of broad war crimes.  In response, it proposes to ban the BBC in Rwanda.  That seems like a plea of guilty.  24 October 2014 (Fossil Fuel)  Fossil fuel interests have spent 7 million dollars to defeat a  referendum to ban fracking in Santa Barbara County.   24 October 2014 (Selling Data)  Schools and hospitals in the US are selling data about the students and patients  they are supposed to serve.  24 October 2014 (Online Avatars) Civil liberties advocate opposes use of online avatars  to catch sex offenders.  There are two issues here. First, the question of whether a person should face prosecution for a fictitious crime against a fictitious person. Second, supposing the answer is yes, there is the issue of entrapment, luring the person to commit the fictitious crime.  24 October 2014 (UK's Economy) The UK's economy has experienced a structural change of low pay for workers, starting  in 2003, and apparently permanent. Now that the UK has more or less exempted the rich and multinational companies from tax, the tax burden falls mainly on workers. Thus, the low pay wipes out tax revenue. The rich and businesses must be put into the tax base.  24 October 2014 (Investigation) Elizabeth Warren Demands An Investigation  Of Mortgage Companies.  24 October 2014 (Chicago Police Department) Amid Shootings, Chicago Police Department  Upholds Culture of Impunity.  Some killer thugs even get awards.  24 October 2014 (Gough Whitlam) Gough Whitlam, Australia's great social reformer, was removed from office by a CIA scheme.  A CIA agent admits it.  24 October 2014 (Track)  A company installed "beacons" to track passersby's phones  in four US cities.  24 October 2014 (El Salvador) El Salvador s Fight Against Gold Mine Will  Be Decided in D.C.  These treaties do not deserve to be obeyed, only torn up. That's what the Salvadoran government should do.  24 October 2014 (Driver) FTDI's proprietary driver for its USB-to-serial chips  sabotages alternative replacement chips when it finds them.   The driver can be used for sabotage because it is nonfree software. There is nothing whatsoever wrong with making other compatible chips, and it is wrong to call them "counterfeit" unless they are sold dishonestly.  23 October 2014 (Workers' rights undermined)  The euro-zone countries are reacting to a repeat recession by undermining workers' rights yet again.  23 October 2014 (Giving food to homeless people)  More US cities are making it a crime to give food to homeless people.  The right-wing idea is that homeless people are homeless because they are lazy; they were punished enough, they would find jobs. Of course, other right-wing policies have made sure there are no jobs for them and that jobs don't pay enough to rent a place to live.  23 October 2014 (Attacks on Canada)  Canada has seen two attacks by isolated Islamists against soldiers in Canada.  Several responses that Canada will be tempted to make, but must not make:  Send ground troops to fight in Iraq. (Just the thing to strengthen PISSI's support among Iraqi Sunnis.)  Crush civil liberties at home. Canada has already taken such a step with secret courts, which is one step too much.  Impose total surveillance so spy agencies will know everything about everyone.  23 October 2014 (ISPs that don't rat on customers)  An ISP in Australia is resisting copyright industry demands to rat on their customers.  One in the US is doing this too.  23 October 2014 (Great Barrier Reef)  Dredging the Great Barrier Reef for coal exports will endanger development of fish larvae.  23 October 2014 (UCL's "sustainability institute")  University College London has set up a "sustainability institute" funded by a giant mining company.  It must be difficult for people at that institute to be honest about the damage caused by mining.  23 October 2014 (TVs to monitor users)  TVs will be designed to monitor their users.  This article uses the perverse concept of "consuming" video. That word enables the writer to demonstrate his sophistication in disregarding all aspects of a situation except the economics, and getting even that wrong.  23 October 2014 (French Pun)  New pun in French.  23 October 2014 (Urgent: Stop pro-fracking ads on NPR)  In the US: tell NPR to stop running pro-fracking ads.  23 October 2014 (Urgent: Regulation of refinery pollution)  US citizens: call on the EPA to regulate toxic pollution from oil refineries.  23 October 2014 (Urgent: Have Congress vote on war)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and say, have Congress vote on whether the US should fight PISSI.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  23 October 2014 (Occupation of Palestine)  The permanent occupation of Palestine is accompanied by a permanent rejection of the idea that Palestinians under Israeli rule have human rights.  23 October 2014 (Bush's chief of "environmental quality")  Bush's appointed a paid global heating denialist as his chief of "environmental quality", whereupon he imposed changes on government scientific reports to minimize the danger.  Are you a young person? That official was putting your life in danger.  23 October 2014 (US spy agency personnel)  US spy agency personnel can get away with perjury, destruction of evidence, torture, kidnaping and assassination. The only unforgivable crime is telling the people how they are spitting on our rights.  Laura Poitras talks about her experience working with Edward Snowden.  23 October 2014 (Blackwater guards convicted)  Blackwater security guards were convicted of manslaughter.  However, the higher-ups who put them in a position to kill Iraqis are not being prosecuted.  23 October 2014 (Geneva homeless shelters)  In Geneva, old fallout shelters are now in use as homeless shelters.  23 October 2014 (Vietnamese blogger exiled)  An imprisoned Vietnamese blogger was removed from jail and put straight on a plane to exile in the US.  Ironically, it seems the statements that he was jailed for were a nationalistic criticism of China, not a campaign for freedom.  23 October 2014 ("Terrorism")  Note to Canada: it is not "terrorism" to kill soldiers of a country at war.  One can argue it is treason for a Canadian to thus take sides against his own country.  The ethics of this are a complicated question. Was Mr Rouleau fighting on behalf of Iraqis devastated by Bush's conquest and occupation of Iraq (done with Canada's help), or was he fighting on behalf of the PISSI which is more cruel than Bush ever dreamed of being?  23 October 2014 (Facebook claims loss in UK)  Facebook juggles its books to claim that it has "lost money" in the UK.  Make Facebook lose money for real! Don't be a used of Facebook!  23 October 2014 (Large dam project in India)  India is railroading a large dam project through slipshod environmental review.  23 October 2014 (Drug-resistant TB)  Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Poses Global Threat, Warn Doctors.  23 October 2014 (Australia's treatment of asylum seekers)  An Australian MP asked the ICC to investigate Australia's treatment of asylum seekers.  23 October 2014 (Phthalates)  Just about everyone is exposed to phthalates that seep out of plastics, and they have various harmful effects on people.  23 October 2014 (Rising sea levels in Venice)  Rising sea levels due to global heating are affecting gondolas in Venice: they have trouble getting under the old bridges.  By and by, Venice will have to be dammed off from the Adriatic Sea, and water pumped out of the lagoon all the time.  23 October 2014 (Afghanistan's poppy production)  Afghanistan's poppy production has hit a record level. Since the government tries to destroy poppies, they are grown mainly in areas controlled by the Taliban.  23 October 2014 (UK fracking investigators)  The UK will have the "risks and benefits" of fracking investigated by a team funded by frackers.  The team says it will be "impartial", the way Faux News is "fair and balanced".  23 October 2014 (Canadian indigenous people's land)  Canadian indigenous people are using their traditional land title to protect the environment, so the Canadian government is trying to force them to sell nearly all their land for a pittance.  23 October 2014 (Euphemisms that dehumanize)  "Cleansing the Stock" And Other Ways Governments Talk About Human Beings.  23 October 2014 (Books banned by US schools)  Right-wing US school boards are banning books about poverty and social classes.  23 October 2014 (CVS to penalize competitors)  The drugstore chain CVS owns a company that reimburses drug stores from insurance companies.  The idea of penalizing people for using drug stores that cell cigarettes might be good, but one drug store should not be able to decide on such policies towards its competitors.  22 October 2014 (Urgent: Impeach Judge Fuller)  US citizens: call on Congress to impeach Judge Fuller, who pled guilty to attacking his wife.  22 October 2014 (Future of journalism in the US?)  The future of journalism in the US: will "official sources" be the only sources?  22 October 2014 (Inverted totalitarianism)  How to rebel against "inverted totalitarianism"?  22 October 2014 (US "security" policy)  A scholar argues that US "security" policy is decided by an entrenched bureaucracy, not by elected officials.  This may be true in practice, but a president opposed to massive surveillance could stop it.  22 October 2014 (Cluster bombs dropped on Donetsk)  It appears Ukraine dropped cluster bombs on Donetsk.  22 October 2014 (Nigeria's vigorous response to Ebola)  How Nigeria's vigorous response quashed Ebola in that country.  22 October 2014 (Putting dissidents in mental hospitals)  Putin has reestablished the Soviet practice of declaring dissidents mentally incompetent and imprisoning them in mental hospitals.  22 October 2014 (Solving Urban Homelessness)  Housing First: the 'Counterintuitive' Method for Solving Urban Homelessness.  22 October 2014 (Occupy Parliament Square in London)  Democracy protesters have occupied Parliament Square in London for several days. Recently they were attacked by thugs using a law designed pre-emptively to criminalize protest camps.  21 October 2014 (The repressed Christian US South)  Google search statistics suggest that porn is especially popular in the repressed Christian south of the US.  21 October 2014 (Large centralized power plants)  Large centralized power plants carry large unreliability.  21 October 2014 (Microsoft's "immutable laws of security")  Microsoft's "immutable laws of security" ironically imply (law 1 and 2) that if Windows is on your computer, it's not secure.  21 October 2014 (Imprisonment for tearing up a photo)  Zainab Al-Khawaja faces 7 years' imprisonment in Bahrain for tearing up a photo of the king.  Freedom of speech includes the freedom to insult any person, any group, any organization, and any idea.  Bahrain used Saudi troops to crush protests, with total US backing.  21 October 2014 (Gamergate)  Gamergate explained.  Here's what I think of this.   The principal wrong in this issue consists of the threats of rape and murder made against some commentators. These threats are inexcusable. Even supposing the targets' statements were mistaken or dishonest, that would not justify these threats.  The integrity of journalism is a significant issue, in regard to computer games as in every other area. However, according to this article, the initial accusation that a game designer exercised dishonest influence on a journalist is demonstrably false.  Meanwhile, US journalism is subject to distorting influence in regard to issues such as war, destabilization campaigns, supporting tyrannical allies, global heating, "free trade" treaties, massive surveillance, and others.  The quality of journalism is also a significant issue. Journalism about computer games is generally lousy because it focuses solely on what playing the game is like, and disregards the grave ethical flaw nearly all these games have: a nonfree software engine.   If you value your freedom, rather than arguing about whether a review of a nonfree game was accurate in regard to secondary aspects, refuse to run nonfree games.  21 October 2014 (Illegal Copying)  Illegal Copying Has Always Created Jobs, Growth, And Prosperity.  21 October 2014 (Punishing prison guards that are whistleblowers)  The UK government is punishing prison guards that are whistleblowers.  21 October 2014 (Citizen's right to vote)  The US needs a constitutional amendment to establish every citizen's right to vote.  21 October 2014 (Long-Acting birth control)  There's finally an effective way to end teen pregnancy: long-acting birth control.  21 October 2014 (Hatred against disabled)  The UK government's real attitude towards the disabled is now patent: to stir up hatred against them while pushing them into hopeless poverty.  People who hate the disabled will forget to hate the plutocrats that really deserve it.  A worldwide survey of happiness finds that people are generally happier in societies with "big government" that runs ample welfare programs.  20 October 2014 (UK gov't want to collect data without warrant)  The UK government wants to be able to collect data from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube automatically (without a warrant, of course).  20 October 2014 (The TPP)  The US wants to use the TPP to impose criminal penalties on access to trade secrets through a computer, with no protection even for journalists investigating dangerous or unjust practices.  This calls to mind the "Ag-Gag" bills designed to criminalize undercover investigations of shameful or illegal farm practices.  20 October 2014 (Finnish parliament won't consider petitions)  Finland has a system for the public to propose revised laws by petition; then the parliament is supposed to vote on these changes. A petition for small relaxation in harsh copyright law was rejected by a committee as too radical.  So far, parliament has rejected all six of the petitions without voting on any of them.  20 October 2014 (Senate's report on CIA torture)  The Senate's still unpublished report on CIA torture intentionally disregards the role of higher officials in the Bush regime.  20 October 2014 (Neonicotinoid pesticide)  A study found that a neonicotinoid pesticide, used on soy beans, provides little or no benefit in production.  Farmers may still want to use it, if it gives a little benefit, but we should not allow them to do so.  20 October 2014 (Tracking of people's movements)  A Florida court ruled that tracking a person's movements in real time through cell phone data requires a warrant.  This is a good decision, but I still don't feel like carrying a cell phone and giving that data to anyone.  20 October 2014 (Chevron trying to buy elections)  Will Chevron succeed in buying municipal elections in Richmond, California?  20 October 2014 (French senate votes for censorship)  The French senate voted for the Loi Cazeneuve, which imposes dangerous censorship.  20 October 2014 (Pressure to divest from fossil fuels)  Environment defenders are moving their money out of Australia's big banks to pressure them to divest from fossil fuels. They claim $250 million has already been moved for this reason.  This goes with warnings that fossil fuel reserves are a bubble that has to burst.  20 October 2014 (Death sentences for blasphemy)  Pakistan continues sentencing people to death for blasphemy, after trials that would be unjust even for a real crime.  Changing the trials and the penalties would make the blasphemy law do less damage, but would not make it just. Freedom of speech includes the freedom to offend or insult any person, real or imaginary. Criminalizing blasphemy was wrong in Britain, just as it is wrong in Pakistan today.  The unfair trials are a second injustice, and the murder of politicians is a third. What all three have in common is that they are perpetrated by religious fanatics who believe they are entitled to use force against those who would criticize them.  20 October 2014 (HK protests)  The Hong Kong protest has grown to around 10,000 again, and thugs had to give up on attacking the protesters.  20 October 2014 (Mexico's disappeared students)  Protesters in Mexico continue to demand return of the 43 disappeared students, and also take actions to denounce and apologize for other protesters' violence.  All those mass graves, whether they contain these students or not, are testimony to the violence that Mexico has experienced from the "war on drugs". When a war is on drugs, its violence affects everyone indiscriminately.  20 October 2014 (CIA report on arming foreign rebels)  An internal report of the CIA found that arming rebels in other countries has almost never been effective.  In many cases it was a good thing that this failed, since the US was attacking governments with local support, for reasons of commercial interest.  20 October 2014 (Haiti's former dictator dead)  Although Haiti's former dictator "Baby Doc" is dead, his repression continues under President Martelly. Martelly is also fabricating charges against Aristide.  The US intervened shamelessly to make Martelly "president".  20 October 2014 (Detroit water rates)  Detroit's bankruptcy-imposed government continues trying to make people with no income pay high rates for water.  20 October 2014 (Renewable electric generation)  Germany and Nordic countries are developing so much renewable electric generation capacity that they can retire some fossil fuel plants.  20 October 2014 (Khomeini said no to WMDs)  Ayatollah Khomeini decided that Iran cannot make weapons of mass destruction.  20 October 2014 (James Risen's new book)  A review of Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War, by James Risen.  20 October 2014 (Kurdish reinforcements) The US dropped weapons and supplies  to Kurds in Kobani. and appears to have convinced Turkey to let Kurdish  reinforcements in.   20 October 2014 ("Cost savings" costing society)  "Cost savings" obtained by screwing the poor and sick often cost society dearly. For instance, the UK could save 8 billion pounds a year by spending a mere 1/3 billion  on mental health care for mothers. Reducing spending or deficits is only an excuse. When right-wingers succeed in doing this, they turn around and cut taxes for the wealthy or businesses, thus creating another deficit that they "need" to reduce by screwing the poor and sick.   20 October 2014 (Secret trial in UK) An accused terrorist in the UK is being tried  partly in secret. A secret trial is an unjust trial, but we have already seen enough to condemn one the charges, that of "possessing a document". For there to be any work that it is forbidden to have a copy of is incompatible with human rights.  20 October 2014 (Canada punishes NGOs with audits)  The Canadian government is punishing NGOs with audits for writing to the government about issues,  which is supposed to be legal for them.  20 October 2014 (Deceptive business practices)   Deceptive practice has become standard practice for many businesses.  20 October 2014 (Democratic school)  A democratic primary/secondary  school in the US.  20 October 2014 (Urgent: No palm oil from deforestation)  Everyone: Tell McDonalds to adopt a policy to make sure its palm oil does  not cause deforestation.  20 October 2014 (Republicans)  Republicans insanely condemn Obama's rational response to the  danger of Ebola virus. What they demand to avoid at all costs is what will make the US safer from Ebola and other future epidemics: supporting proper public health systems in poor countries.   20 October 2014 (Privatization in Africa)  Western-imposed privatization and spending cuts in Africa produced weak health care systems that can't cope with  epidemics such as Ebola.  20 October 2014 (PISSI)  PISSI enslaves captured women. Some have escaped, and then a strange thing happens: they feel ashamed, rather than proud  of their strength and courage.  I think this reflects twisted patriarchal gender attitudes, the same ones that provide the soil for PISSI to grow in. If you want to watch the video from youtube, don't watch it embedded &mdash; that uses nonfree software. Instead, fetch it with youtube-dl. PISSI captures and  kills Iraqi journalists too.  20 October 2014 (Automation)  Automation is the central factor behind a 10% fall in wages for British workers without unusual marketable skills,  and it is going to get worse. More or less the same is happening in the US. The solution is obvious: tax the rich to spread the benefits that automation provides.  20 October 2014 (Indigenous Peoples' Day)  Seattle celebrated Indigenous Peoples' Day, rather than celebrating the  man who started killing and enslaving them.  If you want to listen to the audio, for please use one of the alternative formats that work without enabling Javascript code.  20 October 2014 (Coal Companies)  Coal companies used the G20 meeting to lobby for more coal mining, presenting coal  as the savior of the world. It's ridiculous, of course, but officials often support ridiculous claims to get funds for their election campaigns, or work in retirement.  20 October 2014 (Facebook)  Facebook is still suspending the accounts of drag queens  that don't reveal their official names.  However, Facebook is trying to convince them to stay, so it can do drag net surveillance.  20 October 2014 (UK proposes privatized prison for teenagers)  The UK is cutting the budget for education for teenagers in prison, but it proposes to build a privatized prison for teenagers as an  excuse to legalize using force against them.  20 October 2014 (Edzard Ernst) Edzard Ernst, hero of  scientific medicine.  20 October 2014 (Amazon deforestation doubles)  The rate of deforestation in the Amazon rain forest  has doubled since a year ago.  20 October 2014 (Beware the BitLicense)  Beware the  BitLicense.  20 October 2014 (Erdogan refuses to help defend Kurds)  Erdogan says Turkey will not help the  US defend Kurds. This formalizes what was already apparent. So much for Obama's dream coalition. However, the US can bring food, arms and Kurdish fighters to Kobani by air without Turkey's help.  20 October 2014 (Pharmaceuticals and wildlife destruction)  Human pharmaceuticals could be to blame for part of the massive destruction of wildlife now occurring.  20 October 2014 (Repeated attacks on HK protesters)  Thugs have repeatedly attacked the massed protesters in Hong Kong. The protesters resist the sticks and pepper spray  without attacking.  20 October 2014 (Christian doctrine of hell)  Has the Christian Doctrine of Hell Become an  Awkward Liability?  20 October 2014 (Right-to-die activist fasts to death)  Jean Davis, 86 years old, fasted to death because her children were forbidden to help her  get a less difficult death.  20 October 2014 (Transport of Kurdish peshmerga)  Is it possible for the US to bring Kurdish peshmerga from Iraq to Kobani by helicopter? That might save the Kurds of Kobani.  Is it possible for the US to airdrop food and ammunition to them? Even if half of it fell into the hands of the jihadis, that half would make no material difference (they already have plenty of both), and the other half might save the Kurds of Kobani.  20 October 2014 (Being Homeless in USA)  Ten Facts about Being Homeless in USA.  Basically, governments don't help the homeless as much and persecute them more.  20 October 2014 (Increase in suicides in UK prisons)  Inadequate staffing is causing an increase in suicides in UK prisons.  In some cases, the suicide seems to be a reaction to mistreatment. How can it make sense to put a suicidal person, not accused of doing anything wrong to others, in prison "for his safety"? Even a well-staffed prison is not a safe or secure place.  20 October 2014 (Children enslaved in Italy)  4000 African children who got into Italy appear to have been kidnaped and enslaved.  20 October 2014 (Divestment from fossil fuel companies)  The aim of divestment from fossil fuel companies is to show that these investments are odious, and force them to pay for all the future damage they have caused.  20 October 2014 (Global heating effects nonuniform)  The effects of global heating are nonuniform. The average October temperature in Pt Barrow has risen 7C (12F) since 34 years ago.  20 October 2014 (NY Times definition of "democracy")  The New York Times once again defines "democracy" in Latin America as "submitting to the USA".  20 October 2014 (Hong Kong protest)  Thugs repeatedly clear away protest areas in Hong Kong.  If the 400,000 who supported the protests were to keep protesting, the antidemocratic government might have to yield.  20 October 2014 (New Pun)  New pun: geometer.   20 October 2014 ("Stand your ground")  Right wing judges and officials don't want "stand your ground" laws to apply to women defending themselves from violent domestic partners.  Indeed, those laws are meant to allow white men (who dare carry guns in public) to kill black men (who know thugs would fabricate an excuse to beat them and arrest them if they carried guns in public). Helping women was never the intention.  20 October 2014 (Using war to stay in power)  Navalny, after a relaxation in the terms of his house arrest, accuses Putin of using war to stay in power.  20 October 2014 (Minimum-Wage pay is too little)  The people who clean the UK foreign ministry protested that their minimum-wage pay is too little to live in London and do the job.  The article demonstrates the harm done by subcontracting, which gives the state and other companies a way to hire people for low wages and say "we're not responsible, since we don't employ them."  A company or agency that gets workers through a subcontractor should be directly responsible for how they are treated and how much they are paid.  20 October 2014 (Man Sues Germany for Drone Killings of Civilians)  Yemeni Man Sues Germany for Role in US Drone Killings of Civilians.  20 October 2014 (Urgent: An end to trials of GMO wheat)  US citizens: call for an end to trials of GMO wheat.  19 October 2014 (NY thugs' driving records private)  Thugs in New York State say that they can collect information on everyone's driving because that's public; but when a reporter asked to see their records about him, they claimed it was secret.  19 October 2014 (Campaign reduces rhino horn demand)  An education campaign in Vietnam has cut the demand for rhino horn by 33%, by correcting the superstitious idea that it is beneficial.  Can anyone make plausible imitation rhino horn? It would work just as well as the real thing.  19 October 2014 (Finfisher)  Privacy International calls for prosecution of the British company that made the Finfisher intrusion/spying program, used by the cruel Bahraini regime to attack activists in England.  19 October 2014 (Morocco)  Ray Cole describes how in Morocco he was accused based on irrelevant evidence, jailed incommunicado, and bullied into signing a statement he could not read.  The prison guards also lied to the British consul, saying Cole did not want to see him.  It seems clear they treat Moroccans just as badly.  19 October 2014 (Massive biometrics capture)  Australia's government proposes massive biometrics capture, but may not succeed in imposing it.  19 October 2014 (Fracking)  If a lot of natural gas is obtained by fracking, it will squeeze out renewable energy and likely result in more greenhouse gas emissions.  19 October 2014 (Reducing the weak to desperation)  A Tory minister called for paying the disabled less than minimum wage, stating explicitly the right-wing goal of reducing the weak to desperation.  The same goal is at work in making prisoners work for companies that pay them a pittance. This reduces jobs and wages for people outside prison, and more of them will end up in prison, making a vicious cycle.  19 October 2014 (CO2 emissions-trading scheme)  Europe Needs to Fix Or Ditch Its Emissions-Trading Scheme.  A carbon tax would be better. One of the problems with the European emissions-trading scheme is that it is too easily gamed: companies can get credit for industries that have simply failed, for instance, and emissions credits are so cheap that nobody really needs to conserve.  19 October 2014 (Private "police foundations")  Private "police foundations" buy controversial massive surveillance equipment and donate it to thug departments across the US, bypassing democratic decisionmaking about what these systems should do.  19 October 2014 (Fish in offshore oil wells)  Offshore oil wells are great habitats for fish.  Burning oil generates CO2 which makes some fish dangerously uncautious and will kill (at a sufficient concentration) many shelled animals.  But we could plant suitable structures without using them to extract oil.  19 October 2014 (Depleted uranium use)  Iraqi Doctors Call Depleted Uranium Use "Genocide".  19 October 2014 (Call for thug accountability)  From Chicago to Geneva, a Call for Police Accountability for Violence and Torture.  19 October 2014 (Colombian farmers suing BP)  Colombian farmers are suing BP in Britain.  19 October 2014 (Farm pesticides and suicide)  Farm pesticides have been linked to an increase in depression and suicide.  19 October 2014 (Texas abortion providers)  The US Supreme Court allowed some Texas abortion providers to reopen &hellip; until the case is finally decided.  19 October 2014 (Massive surveillance)  The UN special rapporteur on counter-terrorism says that massive surveillance violates human rights as defined by the UN.  19 October 2014 (Thugs attack HK protesters)  Thugs attacked Hong Kong protesters and closed some of their barricades.  19 October 2014 (100 students in Egypt arrested)  100 students were arrested in Egypt this week for protesting.  Violent Islamist fanatics continue to fight the regime with terrorism, but all in all their violence is less than what the military regime directed at peaceful Islamist fanatic protesters.  19 October 2014 (43 disappeared students)  The mass graves found in Mexico appear not to contain the 43 disappeared students.  19 October 2014 (Gun threat against feminist)  A talk by feminist Anita Sarkesian was cancelled due to a mysogynist threat to shoot her, backed up by a state law that prohibited stopping people from bringing weapons into the auditorium.  That law says, in effect, that anyone people threaten to shoot cannot speak in public.  19 October 2014 (Private charities)  Private charities are nowhere near capable of giving America's tens of millions of poor people the help they need.  19 October 2014 (Why no banksters go to jail in the US)  Matt Taibbi explains why no banksters go to jail in the US, while so many blacks and welfare recipients do: because thugs systematically harass those groups seeking (and inventing) excuses to arrest them.  It's not policing, it's occupation.  19 October 2014 (Corruption charges in Turkey)  The corruption charges against high officials in Turkey have been dropped. Many of the officials involved in bringing the charges had faced official retribution.  Either the charges were bogus and placed for political reasons, as Erdogan says, or they were valid and he has protected his party colleagues' abuse of power. I have no way of determining which it was.  19 October 2014 (Coal ship leaving Australia blocked)  Pacific Islanders blocked a coal ship leaving Australia.  Combustion of fossil fuel is inundating their islands little by little. A few have already become uninhabitable.  19 October 2014 (Prosecuted for filming in West Papua)  French documentary makers are being prosecuted for filming in West Papua, where foreign journalists are not allowed.  Indonesia took over West Papua by force in the 1960s when the Dutch pulled out, and has sent large numbers of Javanese colonists. It's somewhat like China and Tibet.  19 October 2014 (Colleges reshaped by plutocracy and budget cutting)  State colleges in the US today have been reshaped by plutocracy and budget cutting, along with hiring patterns, so that students from poor backgrounds are likely to end up with debts and no good job.  There are some exceptions, of course. If you have talent in a professional field, and you study hard, you can still get a job. For a while.  19 October 2014 (China banned logging in state forests)  China has banned logging in state forests in its most heavily forested province.  In the US, businesses control politicians. In China, the politicians own and control the businesses, or else the state owns them. While Chinese politicians can be quite corrupt, they can also take action to protect China's future from rogue businesses, in a way that US politicians no longer can do.  19 October 2014 (How Whisper users can be identified)  How Whisper users can be identified based on the vague geolocation data Whisper keeps.  18 October 2014 (The power to encrypt people's data)  The FBI presented cases to prove that it needs the power to encrypt people's data. All of the cases were bogus.  18 October 2014 (Iraqi army)  Why the US-constructed Iraqi army couldn't and wouldn't fight PISSI.  Basically, the idea of setting up a client state and training its army to fight for it (i.e., for the US) doesn't work.  18 October 2014 (Cuts aimed at poor people)  US budget cuts aimed at poor people don't ultimately reduce spending. But they sure do help demonize the poor, which is what right-wing politicians need.  18 October 2014 (Urgent: End racism in Boston thug dept.)  Everyone: sign this petition calling on Boston to put an end to racism in its thug department.  18 October 2014 (Urgent: Solidarity with HK protesters)  Everyone: sign this petition of solidarity with Hong Kong democracy protesters.  18 October 2014 (How Microsoft shuts down companies)  Microsoft uses US courts to shut down companies by seizing their domain names so clients cannot contact them. The court cases go on without informing the targeted companies.  18 October 2014 (Australia's millenials)  In Australia, government policy makes millenials poor and the rest of society blames them for it. Many of them, not realizing the fault isn't theirs, are going crazy.  The first step in not going crazy is to realize that the injustice is imposed by the state. The second step is to unite to kick out plutocracy. If the rich were not getting richer, there would be enough for the aged and the young.  18 October 2014 (New TPP leak)  A new leak of the part of the draft Trans-Pacific Partnership shows that the US is pushing mass murder in the form of tightened patent power on medicines.  This treaty does harm already, although it is still a draft, simply by using the propaganda term "intellectual property" to lump together various unrelated laws.  To repeat that term is to boost the confusion &mdash; and we don't have to repeat it. Since I identified the term as a confusion-spreader, ten years ago, I have not used it once.  I will say that the TPP negotiators put the bogus label "intellectual property" on this chapter but I will not use the term myself.  18 October 2014 (Minimum wage of the 1960s)  Raising the minimum wage to match what it was in the 1960s would save 1.7 million Americans from needing public assistance.  18 October 2014 (Fighting PISSI)  Seven potential disasters that could result from fighting PISSI.  It appears to me that we must accept sectarian partition of Iraq. It has, de facto, already happened, and accepting it is the only way to convince Iraqi Sunnis they can protect themselves without PISSI.  PISSI is the Pseudo-Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.  18 October 2014 (UK NHS staff shortages)  The UK NHS is so underfunded that its staff shortages endanger patients.  The reason the NHS is underfunded is plutocratic refusal to tax businesses and the rich; they demand to be subsidized instead.  18 October 2014 (Student protesters in Egypt)  Egypt's US-Backed Military Regime is Brutalizing Student Protestors.  18 October 2014 (TPP)  The latest TPP draft proposes to make coffeehouses liable when their patrons use the internet for sharing.  18 October 2014 (GCHQ and NSA)  Annie Machon: GCHQ prostituting itself to the NSA over the last few years.  18 October 2014 (People's voiceprints)  ACLU: the dangers posed by collecting millions of people's voiceprints.  18 October 2014 (Whisper records user locations)  Whisper, which promises its users anonymity, records their location at each post. The pattern of a single user's movements can more or less identify who that user is.  More dirt on whisper.  18 October 2014 (All MPs of Golden Dawn face charges)  All the MPs of the Golden Dawn party face charges of murder and other acts of violence.  This worries me. The party is neo-Nazi, and some of its members commit violence, but are all of them directly implicated in the violence &mdash; or are they going to be tried for their political views?  This resembles the way Israel arrested hundreds of Hamas supporters and even MPs using a real crime as a pretext.  18 October 2014 (Pushing people into self-employment)  The crass remarks of a Tory minister reveal an already-existing abuse, where people are pushed into self-employment so as to pay them less than a minimum wage.  18 October 2014 (Thugs raid journalist's house)  New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager revealed evidence of the ruling party's dirty political tricks; then thugs raided his house and seized his computers.  Evidently the politicians that control New Zealand prefer to keep crime secret rather than behave honestly.  17 October 2014 (Death sentence for dissent)  Saudi Arabia sentenced a Shi'ite religious leader to death, for "crimes" amounting to dissent.  17 October 2014 (Rape threats against TV personality)  A TV personality has received rape threats after speaking in favor of allowing a convict to resume his previous job after release from prison for rape. Her daughter received rape threats too.  You may agree or disagree with her statement, but threats are not justified as a response.  The US imposes so many kinds of exclusions on ex-cons that, unless they are geniuses, they are almost condemned to a life of crime. This is not in society's interest; it results from politicians' desire to look tough. I don't know whether it is the same in the UK.  It seems to me that people who object to giving this particular ex-con this particular job back view sports stars as symbols of an ideal person. A rapist is a bad choice for an ideal person, but then, I don't consider professional sports as the site to find ideal persons in. I think it is just a well-paid job.  17 October 2014 (Privatization of state services)  US state governors are privatizing state services for profit. In some cases, their own profit.  It is not just states. Chicago privatized parking meters and was greatly shafted.  17 October 2014 (Persecution of reporters' sources)  Obama's persecution of reporters' sources, and how it dwarfs previous US history.  16 October 2014 (Urgent: Cancel oil exploration)  US citizens: Call on Obama to cancel oil exploration on the Atlantic coast, which will make loud sounds that injure whales and dolphins.  I put this as my message.  To avoid global heating disaster, we need to leave 80% of fossil fuel reserves in the ground. Finding more reserves is at best a waste, and when it injures whales, it is worse than a waste.   16 October 2014 (Rates of amputations for US diabetics)  US diabetics are three times as likely to get a leg amputated if they are black, than if they are white.  It is not clear why, but it has to be due to prejudice one way or another.  16 October 2014 (Two nurses catch Ebola in Dallas)  Nurses accuse Dallas hospital of having inadequate equipment to protect them from Ebola, and lousy procedures too. Two of them have caught an Ebola infection.  16 October 2014 (UK fracking)  The UK plans to allow fracking companies to put "any substance" under people's homes, without informing them.  16 October 2014 (Harassment)  Even being wealthy graduates of prestigious schools doesn't enable US blacks to protect their children from racist insults.  What makes the most impression on me is how far blacks in the US have to bend over backwards to avoid being falsely accused or treated with prejudice. These precautions seem to have been mostly effective &mdash; being called a nasty name is not that bad on the scale of human injustice &mdash; but it's unfair for anyone to have to do that.  Meanwhile, think of all the people (black or not) who aren't in the families of wealthy graduates of prestigious schools. They don't deserve to be harassed either.  16 October 2014 (Japan's "national tradition")  Whaling interests in Japan paid a PR company in the 1970s to fabricate a "national tradition" of eating whale meat.  16 October 2014 (Making it hard for minors to get abortions)  For minors in the US, getting a judge's permission for an abortion is painful harassment, often followed by arbitrary denial.  Just getting out of school to go to a court in another town may be a struggle.  I don't understand how people who generally agree it is not a good thing for poor minors to have children come to support laws making it hard for them to avoid doing so.  16 October 2014 (A repeating tendency of SWAT raids)  A SWAT team shot and killed a homeowner who tried to protect himself from a repeat burglary. He didn't know that the burglar claimed to have stolen drugs from him.  I don't see anything saying where this took place, except that it is in the US. Can anyone tell me?  Thieves do steal drugs and drug equipment. Perhaps it was reasonable to investigate the accusation against Hooks. The central problem is the repeating tendency of SWAT raids to kill innocent people.  16 October 2014 (NYC thug violence)  New York City thugs keep on bashing and injuring unarmed people who are not even suspected of doing anything seriously wrong.  If you want to watch the YouTube video, please download it using youtube-dl. If you view it from the site directly, that requires either Flash or nonfree Javascript code.  Another New York City thug stole a thousand dollars from a man after harassing him because he objected to how the thug was treating his friend.  16 October 2014 (Sabotage of TLS security)  A US wireless ISP is reportedly sabotaging TLS security by acting as a man in the middle.  16 October 2014 (Public banks)  How a city can set up a public bank and make its funds secure against failure of the big bankster banks.  16 October 2014 (Israel destroys village's power grid)  Israel destroyed the power grid of a Palestinian village that Israel threatens to demolish entirely.  16 October 2014 (Imprisoned Palestinian Parliament members)  Israel continues to keep 33 members of the Palestinian Parliament in prison, mostly without charges.  The kidnaping and murder of three teenagers is used as the pretext for this, although these elected officials had nothing to do with it.  Imagine if Palestinians could put Israeli right-wing politicians in prison because Israeli fanatics murdered a Palestinian teenager.  16 October 2014 (The PKK)  One Administration's Terrorist Is Another's Freedom Fighter. Just Ask the PKK.  15 October 2014 (Urgent: Curb methane leaks)  US citizens: call on Obama to take action quickly to curb methane leaks from oil and gas extraction.  It appears this needs to be done for coal mining too.  15 October 2014 (Putin to shut down human rights organization)  Russia's principal human rights organization since Soviet times, founded by Andrei Sakharov, is going to be shut down by Putin.  15 October 2014 ("Sports drinks")  "Sports drinks" are mostly used outside of the context of sports, and are bad for people's health.  15 October 2014 (Isolation of young and old)  Modern western society isolates the young and the old, leaving them with no idea of anything to want except wealth.  The statistics cited are from the UK, but I expect it is true in the US as well.  When hippies wished to live in communes, it had to be a rejection of the beginnings of this. The communes failed because just wishing isn't enough to make a new social system succeed.  The loneliness of old people, many of whom had children, shows that having children is not a solution.  Being part of some other sort of community, such as a political activist community that defends people who are being exploited, can make your life a lot less lonely as well as helping others.  15 October 2014 (Ireland to close a tax loophole)  Ireland will close one of the tax loopholes that multinational corporations use to avoid paying tax on their income cross Europe.  However, Ireland's low corporation tax still constitutes beggar-thy-neighbor. The rest of Europe, if it were not corrupted by those same corporations, would make Ireland stop this.  15 October 2014 (Reclaiming Louisiana land lost to sea)  Louisiana plans a megaproject to reclaim some of the 2000 square miles lost to the sea in the last century.  In principle, it is a good idea, but it will be futile if we don't stop pumping out the greenhouse gases that melt icecaps and raise sea level even more.  15 October 2014 (Bolivia reelects Morales)  President Morales of Bolivia was reelected after his socialist policies reduced poverty and grew the economy.  You can cause economic growth with right-wing policies too, as the US and UK have demonstrated, but doing it that way increases poverty.  15 October 2014 (Kurds in Turkey fighting the state)  Fighting has flared up between Kurds in Turkey and the Turkish state.  This fighting seems to have been provoked by Turkey's policy of passively helping PISSI to capture Kobani.  15 October 2014 (UK to deport activist to Pakistan)  The UK plans to deport Liaquat Ali Hazara to Pakistan where he faces death threats from religious fanatics.  15 October 2014 (North Korea keeping people hungry)  North Korea is keeping its people hungry to export rice to wealthier China.  15 October 2014 (Wisconsin's voter ID law)  Various Republican forms of political sabotage worked together to support Wisconsin's voter ID law, leading to a split between modern "hold power no matter how" Republicans and older Republicans who have some loyalty to the ideals of a free political system.  15 October 2014 ("Moral Monday" protests)  Weekly "Moral Monday" protests have begun in Ferguson and in nearby St Louis.  15 October 2014 (Privately hired thugs)  The practice of privately hiring thugs with the legal power to arrest, or to look the other way, endangers the rights of those who aren't paying.  15 October 2014 (New Facebook Pun)  New pun, Facebook's policies.  15 October 2014 (On Doxing)  On doxing, and how to spell it.  14 October 2014 (Urgent: Drop forced arbitration clauses)  In the US: call on banks to drop their forced arbitration clauses.  14 October 2014 (Urgent: Demilitarize US thugs)  US citizens: sign this petition to demilitarize and reform US thugs.  14 October 2014 (UK MPs vote to recognize Palestine)  UK MPs voted to recognize Palestine. Unfortunately it was a non-binding vote.  14 October 2014 (UK university education cost)  The UK has adopted the US model for university education, requiring students to take out huge loans. Nonetheless, many are desperate to go to a university because wages for non-graduates have been knocked down. Indeed, many graduates won't get good jobs because there are too many.  The only aspect which is not quite as bad as the US is that graduates with low incomes won't have to pay as much.  14 October 2014 (UK values submarines above children)  Next year, most children in the UK will be living in poverty. The UK hasn't got the billions needed to help them, because nuclear missile submarines have higher priority.  14 October 2014 (New antiplutocratic parties)  New antiplutocratic parties have had success in several European countries.  14 October 2014 (Sea level rise)  The sea level rise of the past century is a record for 6000 years. (That is when the melting of the ice age ice sheets finished.)  Even if we stop pumping out greenhouse gas, the Earth will continue getting hotter for quite some time due to the greenhouse gas we have already pumped out. That's ignoring the possibility that positive feedback effects will release more. And it will take centuries for the effect of that heat to finish melting all the ice it is going to melt.  We will have to lower the greenhouse gas level substantially below the present level to get the ice to stop melting.  14 October 2014 (Persecution of Koreans in Japan)  In Japan, right-wing extremists with support of officials in the ruling party call for persecution of Korean residents, and have launched a campaign of threats against journalists that cover Japan's war crimes.  The Korean residents of Japan are descendants of Koreans forcibly taken to work in Japan when Korea was under Japanese rule. Those alive today were born in Japan, but in Japan that does not give them citizenship.  Naturalization in Japan is not like naturalization in the US; it requires denying one's previous identity and trying to act totally Japanese. These people of Korean descent might be willing to get Japanese citizenship, but they don't want to deny their identity.  14 October 2014 (Computerized recognition of voices)  Computerized recognition of people's voices is being employed on a large scale.  I don't mind if bank customers can use this authenticate themselves to the bank. What worries me is that it can also be used to track people.  14 October 2014 (Wind power in Europe)  Taking account of externalities, wind power is the cheapest form of generation in Europe.  Coal costs more than double.  14 October 2014 (Safer, more accessible abortions)  Remotely supervised use of prescribed abortion pills can make abortions safer and more accessible.  14 October 2014 (Sexual harassment female students face in UK)  The level of sexual harassment female students face in UK universities today is amazing.  I think it is largely the same in US universities, but I never saw anything like this when I was studying at Harvard in 1970-74.  I think the social pressure to get drunk is the worst part of it.  14 October 2014 (Pushing Europe into depression)  Germany's government is practicing economic harshness for harshness' sake, and pushing Europe into depression.  14 October 2014 (Girls expect to have no control over their lives)  A world-wide survey found that around half of all girls expect to have no control over their lives.  14 October 2014 (Reports on al Qa'ida's magazine)  Peter van Buren reviews reports on al Qa'ida's magazine.  In tyrannical states such as the UK, you could be imprisoned just for having a copy of the magazine.  14 October 2014 (Wearing my "Impeach God" button)  A week ago I made a connection in Dallas-Ft Worth Airport, and was wearing my "Impeach God" button. A pilot said it takes courage to wear such a button there. It did not seem to me that I was being particularly courageous.  However, a rather strange conversation ensued on the subsequent flight: a flight attendant said, "I feel offended by your button. Please take it off."  I responded, "I don't see why you should feel offended, unless &hellip; you're not a god, are you?"  She: "No, but I believe in god."  I: "Well, I don't."  She: "But you're putting your views all over me!"  I: "Actually, I'm putting them all over me. I can't make you wear such a button, and I wouldn't try."  At that point, she let the issue drop.  14 October 2014 (University divestment from fossil fuel)  The Australian National University decided to divest from some fossil fuel companies, which occasioned absurd rebukes from right-wing politicians that represent the fossil fuel companies.  There is no limit to how far they will go to increase fossil fuel sales.  14 October 2014 (The evil of the Koch brothers)  The evil of the Koch brothers includes racism, as well as voter-suppression, dooH niboR and frying Earth's ecosphere.  14 October 2014 (US allows cancelling 60% of pensions)  The US now allows bankrupt cities to cancel 60% of retired workers' pensions.  They can't live on what remains.  14 October 2014 (Pirate Party electoral success)  The Pirate Party had an electoral success in Czech local elections.  14 October 2014 (Generic equivalent drugs)  Around 10 million people with HIV owe their lives to generic equivalent drugs. The Obama regime is pressuring India to stop making them, which would kill millions of those people within a few years.  The Nazis murdered 7 million civilians. This could murder more than 7 million of those now in treatment, and more millions in the future. The US officials behind this are aiming to be literally worse than the Nazi leaders convicted at Nuremberg of crimes against humanity.  The article uses the incoherent propaganda term "intellectual property", which the pharma companies love because it interferes with critical thinking about their unjust demands.  The pharma companies claim that only patents can enable them to do research into new lifesaving drugs, but the fact is they don't do much of that research. It is usually government funded.  14 October 2014 (Dow Chemical cover-up)  Dow Chemical covered up knowledge of the medical damage done by its toxic pesticide, chlorpyrifos; now the question is whether the EPA has the guts to do its job to prevent more sickness.  14 October 2014 (Thousands march in St Louis)  Thousands marched in St Louis on behalf of Michael Brown and against thug violence. Fortunately, this time the thugs did not engage in more violence against the protesters.  14 October 2014 (Urgent: Protect all waterways)  US citizens: call on the EPA to protect all waterways.  14 October 2014 (Centralized social networks)  Centralized social networks can learn a lot about people that don't directly give them data, through what others say about them and even who knows them.  In other words, you should insist that your friends not mention you by name or email address in anything they post on centralized social networks.  I think this applies to gmail as well.  14 October 2014 (Plutocratic governments)  Business is the "enemy within" countries with plutocratic governments.  14 October 2014 (RSA's secret contract with NSA)  When RSA installed key generation code that had been weakened by the NSA, it wasn't just ingenuous &mdash; it took money from the NSA to do so.  14 October 2014 (Removal of "Carbon Sink" sculpture)  Fossil fuel companies and their pet politicians made the University of Wyoming get rid of a sculpture that reminded people about the effects of global heating on forests in that region.  14 October 2014 (Domestic "coercive control")  There is a proposal in the UK to prohibit domestic "coercive control", but identifying that might require a difficult judgment call.  What strikes me is that the methods used for domestic coercive control have a lot in common with the methods used for enslavement of farm laborers and domestic workers. Criminalizing such enslavement has not been very effective at stopping it. Could it be more effective to change other systems so that these methods of control can't be used or don't work?  For instance, if banks automatically gave one spouse access to a limited amount of money from the other spouse's account &mdash; not enough to substantially harm the other spouse, but enough for the one spouse to get by &mdash; one element of coercive control would not work. If spouses were required to jointly view the deed of their residence once in a while, another element used in this instance would not be possible. Other elements could also be blocked.  Enough such concrete measures would often prevent coercive control, and otherwise would make it require a cut-and-dried violation that could be prosecuted easily without a difficult judgment call.  14 October 2014 (Publication of autobiography stopped)  A UK court stopped publication of an autobiography on the grounds that it might cause pain to the author's son.  In the US, which respects freedom of speech much more than the UK, this decision would be called "prior restraint", which is more or less unconstitutional, though I would not trust today's US Supreme Court to stand by that principle or (any human right, when it's for actual humans rather than corporations).  14 October 2014 (Death of an Unpunished Dictator)  Reflections on the Death of an Unpunished Dictator.  14 October 2014 (Deadly shootings by thugs)  A young black male is 21 times more likely to be shot dead by US thugs than a young white male.  14 October 2014 (US military budget)  Obama pretends that the US military budget has suffered intolerable cuts.  14 October 2014 (Damage to coral reefs from CO2)  The damage to coral reefs from CO2 could amount to a trillion dollars annually in losses to humanity, by the end of this century.  14 October 2014 (Reporter faces imprisonment in Korea)  A Japanese reporter in Korea faces 7 years imprisonment for reporting the existence of a rumor about the president.  Did you think it must be North Korea, which is of course a total tyranny? Sad to say, it is South Korea.  If the report was false &mdash; if the rumor did not exist &mdash; it might be legitimate to sue the reporter for claiming it did. However, nothing can justify prosecution for an insult. Freedom of speech means having the right to insult everyone, even President Park, even me, even you.  14 October 2014 (Danger of debt crisis)  Dozens of poor countries are in danger of sliding into a debt crisis.  Many of these debts were more or less imposed by outside pressure and accepted by rulers that were tyrants or traitors. Those debts should be considered entirely invalid.  14 October 2014 (European Commission proposes insane blanket deregulation)  The European Commission proposes insane blanket deregulation (except for the biggest companies). The rest would be allowed to pollute however they like.  14 October 2014 (Theocratic fascism)  Identifying PISSI as a form of theocratic fascism.  14 October 2014 (Urgent: Stop pinkwashing toxic and carcinogenic fracking)  Everyone: call on the Susan G. Komen Foundation to stop pinkwashing toxic and carcinogenic fracking.  More information.  14 October 2014 (Reagan's order 12333)  Reagan's order 12333 lets the US government collect all sorts of data about Americans by copying it from mirror servers located outside the US.  Meanwhile, Snowden says that snooping by the UK government on its cities has no practical limit.  14 October 2014 (Hong Kong protesters being attacked)  Hong Kong protesters are being attacked with military-grade Chinese malware.  14 October 2014 (UK National Health Service underfunded)  The UK National Health Service is so underfunded that it is paying staff poverty wages.  The NHS needs a lot more money, and it needs to come from the rich (including businesses). However, making housing cheaper would help the workers get by; that too depends on increasing taxes on the homes of the rich.  14 October 2014 (Putin has withdrawn a substantial fraction of troops from near border)  Putin has withdrawn a substantial fraction of troops from near the border with Ukraine.  This could still leave substantial numbers to sneak into Ukraine and attack.  14 October 2014 (California aquifers contaminated)  California aquifers contaminated with billions of gallons of fracking wastewater.  14 October 2014 (Attempt to block block nuclear power plants)  There will be a last-ditch attempt to block two new nuclear power plants in the UK, on the grounds that the subsidy will be a burden for the country.  The reason that it is a burden is that the same amount of money could buy a lot more in renewable energy and negawatts (improved efficiency).  13 October 2014 (HK democracy protests resume)  Hong Kong democracy protesters have resumed large protests after the government reneged on talks.  13 October 2014 (NY airplane cleaners on strike)  Airplane cleaners in New York went on strike demanding protection from diseases in vomit and shit that they have to clean up.  13 October 2014 (US coal mine methane leaks)  Satellite data suggest that coal mines in the US southwest are leaking lots of methane.  13 October 2014 (Wisconsin voter-ID law blocked)  The US Supreme Court blocked the voter-ID law in Wisconsin.  13 October 2014 (Carbon-neutral homes)  The Netherlands has renovated 300,000 apartments so that they don't need fossil fuel or external electricity, and 100,000 will be renovated in the UK.  This scheme is very good, but its scale is minuscule: 100,000 homes in a country of 64 million people is a drop in the bucket. Its significance is to show that humanity can still save itself from global heating disaster, if it can overcome plutocracy to do similar things on a large scale.  13 October 2014 (Allowing thugs to confer to coordinate testimony)  UK thug chiefs insist on allowing thugs to confer to coordinate their testimony.  13 October 2014 (Urgent: Pass the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act)  US citizens: call on Congress to pass the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act.  13 October 2014 (Urgent: Pressure Turkey to let Kurds cross the border)  Everyone: Call on Obama to pressure Turkey to let Kurds cross the border, whether to defend Kobani or escape from massacre there.  13 October 2014 (Court order to get journalists' phone records)  The UK will require a court order to get journalists' phone records.  That is a small step in the right direction. I have to ask, however, who this will apply to. On the internet, anyone can be a journalist.  In addition, journalists reporting on ticklish issues such as government snooping must arrange to communicate with their sources in a way that can't be tracked.  13 October 2014 (Cuba fighting Ebola)  Cuba has sent more doctors to fight Ebola than any other country.  13 October 2014 (Facebook to get even more info on digital activities)  Facebook now combines "Like" button tracking data with data from Facebook itself to get even more information about people's digital activities.  Facebook does not tell other companies the identities of users, but they can identify users based on data they get elsewhere.  "Like" button surveillance even tracks people who are not useds of Facebook (i.e., never had a Facebook account).  However, you can block "Like" button tracking with the GNU browser, IceCat.  13 October 2014 (Urgent: Take action against TTIP)  Citizens of Europe and the US: take action against TTIP (This Treaty Is Plutocratic).  13 October 2014 (Saudi Arabia repressing anyone that endorses human rights)  Saudi Arabia, always tyrannical, is now systematically repressing anyone that endorses human rights.  13 October 2014 (Vietnam War)  The Pentagon is trying to paint the Vietnam War as a glorious triumph.  13 October 2014 (Biggest decrease in standard of living)  British workers are experiencing the biggest decrease in standard of living in 150 years.  13 October 2014 (Overprotecting children)  In the US today, parents who would dare resist overprotecting their children face threats from other parents.  When I was six years old, I walked 5 blocks to school in Manhattan. Not that I was unusual &mdash; this is how everyone got to school. We all knew how to cross streets. We all understood traffic lights, since there were traffic lights at every intersection.  13 October 2014 (No Fly List)  For the first time, the US government has officially informed 13 Americans whether they are on the No Fly List.  This is just a small step towards justice. The No Fly List is a deprivation of rights. The US government should not be allowed to put anyone on this list without a trial.  13 October 2014 (Local pollution in parts of the Great Barrier Reef)  Local pollution in parts of the Great Barrier Reef impedes photosynthesis, which leads to higher CO2 levels locally.  12 October 2014 (Arrest of Kurds in Turkey)  Kurds fleeing into Turkey have been arrested without charges and accused of fighting PISSI.  It's unlikely to be true, since some of them are children. However, if some of them really did fight PISSI, it is disgusting to punish anyone for that.  12 October 2014 (Big banks face criminal charges)  Big US banks once again face criminal charges, but the executives will probably get off unscathed yet again.  12 October 2014 (TTIP)  The European Commission is inventing strained legalistic excuses to block a referendum opposing the TTIP.  12 October 2014 (UK agricultural workers exploited)  Agricultural workers in the UK are stripped of their passports and their pay, and gouged on rent.  This is a world-wide pattern, much like what happens to construction workers in Qatar.  A government that doesn't want to let businesses exploit people could adopt laws that make it harder to get away with this. One approach would be to make the farms directly liable for how the temp agency treats the temporary workers. It would help to prosecute the executives and staff of the temp agency, as well as the agency, for any wrongdoing; I can't tell from the article whether this is already done.  12 October 2014 (Mexico protests)  Large protests around Mexico demand release of the 43 students disappeared by thugs.  It looks like the thugs murdered them, but this is not yet certain.  12 October 2014 (Philadelphia students strike)  Philadelphia students went on strike in solidarity with their teachers, whose contract was cancelled.  12 October 2014 (Public defense failure)  Manuel Velez was convicted of murder because the public defender didn't bother to investigate the evidence that proved he was innocent.  The cruel prosecutors gave him a choice between a new trial (on charges already known to be false), which would probably have meant keeping him in jail for a year or two, and pleading guilty to a smaller false charge. Evidently they are more interested in pretending they are never wrong than in justice.  The main cause of these repeated injustices is that we don't have enough public defenders in the US. They can't possibly do a proper job for so many clients. Most of the time they advise clients to make a deal and accept a lesser charge, whether it is true or not.  12 October 2014 (Urgent: Approve Vivek Murthy as Surgeon General)  US citizens: call on the Senate to resist the NRA and approve Vivek Murthy as Surgeon General.  12 October 2014 (Control of forests)  Arguing that putting the local inhabitants or indigenous people in control of forests works better than REDD for ending deforestation.  I see some questionable points. For instance, the danger that the forest's trees may die even if protected exists no matter how we try to protect them. Global heating is killing a lot of pine trees in the US.  12 October 2014 (Customers' call records)  UK mobile phone networks' computers provide customers' call records to the state automatically whenever asked, without even checking for a legally valid order.  A legally valid order made by thugs, without the need to justify it to anyone, is not morally valid.  11 October 2014 (Sharif Mobley)  The US government says it knows where Sharif Mobley is, but refuses to tell his family.  11 October 2014 (NSA sends agents to install spy devices)  The NSA sends agents to install spy devices in networks in various countries, including apparently the US.  For the US government to do this to a rather hostile government such as China does not seem wrong to me. Doing this to Germany and South Korea would be a low blow against an ally if it was done without those states' approval (we don't know). If those states approved of the act, it might mean that they are spying massively on their own citizens.  11 October 2014 (Urgent: Limit US war in Syria and Iraq)  US citizens: call on Congress and Obama to limit US war in Syria and Iraq.  11 October 2014 (Campaign to slow down installation of solar power in the US)  Walmart's owners support organizations that campaign to slow down installation of solar power in the US.  11 October 2014 (Corporate land grabs and "development")  Farmers and indigenous peoples are protesting the World Bank's support for corporate land grabs and "development" that helps business take from the poor.  11 October 2014 (Malala Yousufzai can't return home)  Malala Yousufzai, admired around the world, can't return home because of death threats from the Taliban.  11 October 2014 (Turkey denying entry to refugees)  Turkey is denying entry to 10,000 Kurdish civilian refugees trying to flee Kobani.  The US could airdrop ammunition and food to the Kurds fighting for Kobani. Since the plan is already to arm opponents of PISSI, why not these, now?  11 October 2014 (Sugar consumption made memory worse)  An experiment on adolescent rats finds that heavy sugar consumption made their memory worse.  This does not prove sugar has the same effects on human adolescents, but it might be so.  Other studies have found that low-calorie sweeteners fool the brain into preparing for sugar, causing confusion when the calories do not arrive.  11 October 2014 (Resistance by indigenous peoples)  Amnesty International says that the government of Guatemala, together with Canadian mining companies, provoke resistance by indigenous peoples by setting up mines near their homes without consulting them.  11 October 2014 (Transport of toxic chemicals by rail)  A train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed in the middle of a Canadian town.  No one was directly injured, but the toxic smoke from the burning chemicals may cause people respiratory problems down the line.  11 October 2014 (Walmart trying to cut health insurance)  Walmart is pushing reducing the hours on 30,000 workers so as to deny them health insurance.  The US laws that associate medical care with employment implement a bad policy. For instance, it is an incentive to replace workers with robots. Companies should pay for people's health care through taxes that would only increase if the company replaces workers with robots. The laws ought to be changed so that everyone gets medical care, regardless of the person's life situation.  This does not excuse Walmart's conduct. Ethics are separate from law; taking advantage of a bad law to screw people legally is just as wrong as screwing them illegally.  11 October 2014 (Boston thug racism)  The ACLU studied statistics on how Boston thugs searched pedestrians and found a gross pattern of racism.  11 October 2014 (NSA propaganda activities)  The NSA was asked for a list of the information it has disclosed to reporters. It responded that the list is too secret to show.  The NSA is trying to hide its propaganda activities.  11 October 2014 (Crypto Wars Redux)  Crypto Wars Redux: Why the FBI's Desire to Unlock Your Private Life Must Be Resisted.  11 October 2014 (Defending Kobani against PISSI)  The US has begun bombing PISSI fighters attacking Kobani. Since then, Kurdish forces have started advancing.  PISSI is the Pseudo-Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.  11 October 2014 (Lego cancels Shell marketing)  A pressure campaign (which I supported here) has convinced Lego to cancel its marketing collaboration with Shell.  This sort of thing is very important: we need to strip the fossil fuel companies of the little maneuvers that they use to disguise the murderous nature of their plans.  11 October 2014 (Ebola)  Hundreds of thousands of fools wanted to risk spreading Ebola to humans to save a dog.  Nobody knows whether a dog can pass Ebola to humans, but let's not find out the hard way.  11 October 2014 (Australian journalists and sources)  Australia proposes to imprison journalists and their sources for publishing information about secret searches of people's homes.  10 October 2014 (Urgent: Protect coral and sponge habitat)  US citizens: call on the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to protect coral and sponge habitat in the Bering Sea.  10 October 2014 (Giant coal mine in Australia)  Indian environmentalists are suing to block a giant coal mine in Australia which would export coal to pollute India (as well as polluting the whole world with CO2).  10 October 2014 (Mass surveillance of phone users)  Despite everything the US government says about encryption in phones, the fact is that they still make massive surveillance of everyone easier than before people used them.  10 October 2014 (False confessions)  Burmese expatriates in Thailand confessed to killing two British tourists, but now they say they were tortured into a false confession.  I believe them.  10 October 2014 (US jails mentally ill poor)  In the US, people with harmless mental illnesses end up in jail unless they are rich.  Once jailed, they are put in debt for their imprisonment, so they may never be able to get out.  10 October 2014 (Human cab drivers)  Uber plans to do away with human cab drivers.  It would be easy for a non-plutocratic government to prohibit this, and that's what every country ought to do, unless/until every person gets an adequate basic income so people don't need to be employed.  10 October 2014 (Educational success)  Children of East Asian (mainly Chinese) immigrants excel even in mediocre Australian schools.  This suggests that the root cause of the high educational success of various East Asian countries may not be particularly due to how the schools there are run.  10 October 2014 (ACLU legal victory in Ferguson)  The ACLU won a legal victory: the Ferguson thugs are not allowed to arrest protesters just for standing still.  10 October 2014 (Massive Mongolian Mine)  Massive Mongolian Mine Endangers Nomads' Water, Way of Life.  However, the bigger culprit is global heating, which is hitting Mongolia more than most of the world, and drying it up.  10 October 2014 (Mercury pollution hurts songbirds)  Mercury pollution damages the brains of songbirds.  10 October 2014 (Criminal record)  65 million Americans have a criminal record; many US colleges exclude all of them in blanket fashion.  10 October 2014 (Employers plead for sympathy)  Employers plead for sympathy because they can't find people to hire, but really it's just that they won't pay enough.  10 October 2014 (Fight to Tax Soda in San Francisco)  Inside the $7 Million Fight to Tax Soda in San Francisco.  10 October 2014 (Jewish National Fund)  The Jewish National Fund is actively involved in trying to kick a Palestinian family out of its home near Jerusalem.  Some of the JNF's tree planting campaigns were carried out over former Arab villages whose inhabitants had either fled or been expelled.  10 October 2014 (Ebola epidemic)  The World Bank says 20 billion dollars must be provided to quash the Ebola epidemic.  10 October 2014 (EU Climate and Energy Commissioner)  Former Oil Mogul Confirmed as EU Climate and Energy Commissioner.  He will surely find ways to obstruct progress in decarbonization; whoever proposed him for the post must have done so with this goal in mind. Whatever controls are set up to make sure he does his job, they can't stop him from dragging his feet.  Thus, I fear, the fossil fuel companies have neutralized the only center of political power that was sincerely trying to avert global heating. I fear that they have murdered many of those who are reading this.  10 October 2014 (A law making it easier for businesses to fire workers)  Italy's prime minister Renzi pushed through a law making it easier for businesses to fire workers, hoping that in exchange the EU will avoid punishing Italy more.  These "reforms" are part of the world-wide campaign by business to set countries against each other in a competition for letting business have more power and workers less power. Step by step, business gets to do want it wants, leaving most people poor.  I doubt that the plutocrats will keep their side of this deal. Appeasing them is foolish; the more power they get, the more they can demand more power.  10 October 2014 (Rebel group has taken the capital of Yemen)  A Shi'ite rebel group has taken the capital of Yemen, perhaps with the cooperation of the president.  It opposes the Wahhabi missionaries sent by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia seems to be the root of a large part of the theocratic cruelty in the Arab world, and spreads this with the backing of the US.  10 October 2014 (A thug in St Louis shot a black teenager)  A thug in St Louis shot a black teenager, then claimed the teenager had fired shots with the sandwich his friends said he was carrying.  It would not be beyond a thug to plant a gun on the deceased.  10 October 2014 (Facebook and Master Card will join forces)  Facebook and Master Card will join forces to profile Master Card customers so banks can push them to spend more.  By doing this, Master Card is ratting on its customers. This reinforces the point that using a credit card enables others to take advantage of you. It also interferes with your efforts to limit your spending.  Don't be tracked &mdash; pay cash.  09 October 2014 (Ebola)  Ebola virus may persist a human's semen and milk months after the person has recovered from it.  09 October 2014 (Turkey allows reinforcements to join PISSI)  Turkey is blocking Kurds from joining the defense of Kobani, while allowing reinforcements to join PISSI.  09 October 2014 (Business domination of public TV)  US public TV governing boards are dominated by business executives.  Business also dominates public TV stations through its money.  09 October 2014 (50,000 SWAT raids per year)  With 50,000 SWAT raids per year in the US, lots of people will inevitably get hurt badly.  09 October 2014 (Superstition leads to murder in UK)  Superstition about witches leads to murder, even in the UK.  09 October 2014 (Australia spying law)  Australia Spying Law Meets Grassroots Resistance.  The Australian government's duty is to keep Australians safe &hellip; from total surveillance.  09 October 2014 (Democracy in Syria)  Revolutionary Kurds in Syria have established the sort of popular democracy we would hope that the whole Middle East could have.  09 October 2014 (Release of Brit jailed in Morocco)  The British tourist jailed in Morocco for being homosexual was released. His Moroccan friend or lover is not so fortunate.  09 October 2014 (Helping wildlife by legalizing marijuana)  Extinction of wildlife is another problem that the US could partially solve by legalizing marijuana.  09 October 2014 (Thugs sued)  Jamal Jones is suing thugs for breaking car windows and attacking him only for not carrying identification (which he had no obligation to carry).  It is not enough to sue the thugs and the city; that is no deterrent for thugs. We need to prosecute them.  I hope, if you are ever on a jury, that you will reject any presumption that thugs are telling the truth. Lying in court is habitual with them.  09 October 2014 (Attacks on Palestinians' water supply)  Israel has repeatedly attacked Palestinians' water supply and sewage systems for more than a decade.  09 October 2014 (Israel to demolish homes)  Israeli soldiers told the inhabitants of the village of Khirbet Um al-Jimal that all their homes will be demolished at some undetermined date.  09 October 2014 (Glasgow University voted to divest from fossil fuels)  Glasgow University voted to divest from fossil fuels.  09 October 2014 (Urgent: Allow requests for funds for abortions)  Everyone: tell GoFundMe to allow requests for funds for abortions. Abortion is not like terrorism, violence or addictive drugs.  09 October 2014 (Urgent: Distributing military hardware to thug departments)  US citizens: call on the Pentagon to stop distributing military hardware to thug departments in the US.  09 October 2014 (Adobe's "digital editions" spy system)  Adobe "digital editions" spy system sends users' complete reading logs to Amazon.  Adobe says this is legitimate because users agree to it in the EULA, but pressuring people to click "Ok, spy on me" does not excuse it.  This article focuses on the fact that the NSA can watch this data passing on the net, avoiding the need to use the PAT RIOT act to collect it directly from Adobe. It legitimizes the snooping by saying that's needed to enforce DRM, which legitimizes DRM too. According to the article's view, all this would be fine, if only Adobe didn't also leak everyone's dossier.  As a defense of readers' rights, this is pitifully weak. DRM, being evil itself, can't justify anything.  09 October 2014 (Windows 10 total snooping)  Windows 10 requires users to give permission for total snooping on their files, commands, text input, and voice.  09 October 2014 (Cruel UK prisons)  UK prisons have become so cruel that the government plans to fire the inspector of prisons.  09 October 2014 (Baltimore's inner harbor)  Baltimore's inner harbor will be flooded roughly 900 hours a year, on the average, by 2045 &mdash; due to global heating.  A few decades later, it will be permanently inundated.  Many other US coastal cities and towns face similar problems that we are bringing on ourselves.  09 October 2014 (US food products containing soy or corn)  Consumer Reports found that nearly all US food products containing soy or corn are made with GMOs, even if they are misleadingly labeled as "natural".  09 October 2014 (Clinton endorsed policy of endless war)  Clinton has openly endorsed the policy of endless war.  Put this together with NSA snooping and the systematic dishonesty of the mainstream press, and it adds up to 1984 lite.  The main threat to Americans comes from plutocracy. Plutocracy could kill millions of Americans in the coming decade, mainly through the poverty it imposes. Compared with this, underground terrorists are a tiny threat.  Back when Dubya was president, I speculated that he and al Qa'ida were both working to cause the endless war that suited them both. It seems the same for the US and PISSI. Not that they have explicitly conspired to do this together. Rather, each side expects to gain domestic power from endless war. So PISSI offers bait, and the US government jumps for it.  09 October 2014 (Terrorism is gift that keeps on giving)  For the fascist plans of US officials, terrorism (real or imaginary) is the gift that keeps on giving.  The author makes a mistake by saying that "we" have adopted these foolish attitudes, because that effectively insists the reader can't reject them. We can all reject them &mdash; it just takes a tiny bit of moral fiber. I reject them every time they come up, and you can, too.  08 October 2014 (Endless war programmed by US officials)  US officials, Republican and Democrat, have programmed an endless war all around the world.  It is endless by nature, because its tactics generate more enemies, and have never won a victory anywhere.  08 October 2014 (US policy distinction between Iraq and Syria)  The US makes an abstract policy distinction between Iraq and Syria, and in Syria only attacks PISSI's logistical support, not its troops. This is why it has not provided close air support to the Kurds fighting to defend Kobani.  Meanwhile, the US wants Turkey to fight this battle, but Turkey would rather fight Assad that PISSI.  Close air support is the only sort of fighting that the US ought to do against PISSI. Once it starts attacking urban facilities, it causes civilian casualties.  08 October 2014 (Exaggeration about PISSI foreigners)  The chance that foreigners fighting for PISSI will return home and commit violence there has been exaggerated beyond what past experience suggests.  Politicians seeking to abolish human rights persistently exaggerate the danger of terrorism.  08 October 2014 (Questioning the claims of "psychics")  The author of leaflets questioning the validity of "psychics"' claims to talk with the dead has been threatened with a lawsuit by a psychic.  08 October 2014 (How Big Pharma bilks Americans)  How the Big Pharma companies make Americans pay more for medicines than people in any other country.  08 October 2014 (Ellsberg on Obama's Iraq strategy)  Daniel Ellsberg judges Obama's Iraq strategy against the facts of the Vietnam War.  08 October 2014 (Criticisms of fracking deleted)  New York Governor Cuomo had criticisms of fracking deleted from a scientific report.  Cuomo pretends to be neutral on the issue while secretly trying to impose fracking on the unwilling citizens of New York.  08 October 2014 (Harassment of US freedom group)  The UK freedom group Cage was almost forced to shut down by official harassment including closure of its bank accounts.  08 October 2014 (Enxet land)  The Enxet people, in Paraguay, keep winning legal victories to get back the land they were kicked off. But the government has been reluctant to implement these decisions.  08 October 2014 (UK NHS grossly underfunded)  The UK National Health Service is so underfunded that it will soon have to charge fees for hospital beds, fees which poor people can't pay.  08 October 2014 (How Nigeria quashed Ebola outbreak)  Nigeria quashed its Ebola outbreak quickly, because it had a strong enough medical system to do what was necessary.  08 October 2014 (The Great Barrier Reef)  Australia has destroyed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's credibility as well as its ability to do is job.  This was not suicide, it was murder: the government wants nothing to stand in the way of its plans that include destroying the reef.  08 October 2014 (Twitter fighting PAT RIOT act)  Twitter is suing to overturn the PAT RIOT act's gag provisions.  08 October 2014 (Urgent: Send a bankster to jail)  US citizens: tell Holder, send a bankster to jail before you leave office.  08 October 2014 (Students killed in Mexico)  In Mexico, plutocratist politicians allied with drug gangs are killing students that oppose the abolition of rural schools.  The plutocrats that dominate Mexico via NAFTA don't want any money to be spent on educating poor rural Mexicans.  08 October 2014 (UK's National Crime Agency)  The National Crime Agency Would Take [The UK] Back to Soviet-Style Surveillance.  08 October 2014 (Young jobless people)  Politicians Should Stop Bullying Young Jobless People into Trying to Find Work.  08 October 2014 (Terrorist movements)  Long experience shows that the only way to deal with terrorist movements (other than small gangs without public support) is to negotiate with them.  This may not apply to PISSI today, which is more of a barbarian horde than a terrorist movement. It can be defeated in battle, at this stage. If that happens, it may morph into a terrorist movement.  08 October 2014 (PISSI capturing Kobani)  PISSI is slowly capturing parts of Kobani.  08 October 2014 (Evidence links Roundup to cancer)  Many forms of evidence link Roundup to increased rates of cancer in humans.  08 October 2014 (Education in Finland)  Finland's schools demand less school time, have hardly any standardized tests, and students come out very well educated.  08 October 2014 (Guantanamo force-feeding videos)  Guantanamo force-feeding videos show that torture is still practiced there, even against prisoners that are admittedly not criminals and have been "cleared for release".  08 October 2014 (UK corporate welfare)  The UK government is talking about cutting human welfare funds to dump people into the street. Why not cut corporate welfare instead?  07 October 2014 (Urgent: No palm oil from destroyed forests)  Everyone: call on giant fast food companies to stop using palm oil from farms created by destroying forests and peat swamps.  07 October 2014 (Urgent: Free Ghoncheh Ghavami)  Everyone: write to the political leaders of Iran on behalf of Ghoncheh Ghavami, an Iranian woman threatened with dying in prison because she wanted to watch a sports match.  07 October 2014 (Urgent: Investigate bank regulators)  US citizens: Call for an investigation of submissive bank regulators that don't dare enforce regulations on Goldman Sachs.  07 October 2014 (Bureaucratization and marketization)  An argument that the bureaucratization and marketization of society is partly responsible for putting an end to major technological advances since 1970.  07 October 2014 (Clinton owes Ray McGovern an apology)  Hillary Clinton owes Ray McGovern an apology, because the State Department under her direction persecuted dissident Ray McGovern.  I agree, but I lost my respect for Ms Clinton long ago for other reasons.  07 October 2014 (Cell phone trackers in NYC phone booths)  500 New York City phone booths have devices to track cell phones that pass by.  The city says it will remove them.  07 October 2014 (Turkey makes trade with PISSI)  Turkey traded PISSI soldiers interned in Turkey for Turkish civilians captured by PISSI.  PISSI is the Pseudo-Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.  07 October 2014 (Biden apologizes for telling truth)  Vice President Biden was forced to apologize for telling the truth about US "allies" that funded the growth of the jihadi movement in Syria (leading to PISSI).  07 October 2014 (UK arms exports to Israel)  UK arms exports to Israel may be illegal under UK law.  06 October 2014 (Obama's plan to fight PISSI)  Obama's plan to strengthen "moderate" Syrian opposition to fight against PISSI has so many problems that the US can't find suitable "moderate" Syrian opposition to support.  06 October 2014 (Cost of global heating)  Estimates of the cost of curbing global heating need to be set against the costs of failing to do so. The medical costs of global heating will be bigger than people realize.  06 October 2014 (Morocco imprisons tourist for "being gay")  Morocco has imprisoned a tourist, convicting him of "being gay".  06 October 2014 (HK executive's strategy against protesters)  The Hong Kong executive defeated the protesters by waiting for them to lose hope.  06 October 2014 (The World's Open Dumps Are Growing)  Smelly, Contaminated, Full of Disease: the World's Open Dumps Are Growing.  06 October 2014 (A monstrous censorship law)  Australian senators voted for a monstrous censorship law without reading it.  If you see government agents kill people, either accidentally or intentionally, it will be illegal for you to tell anyone.  06 October 2014 (UK thugs to investigate themselves)  UK thugs have been directed to investigate their own intimidation of political activists.  06 October 2014 (Staff take sexual advantage of prisoners)  In a privatized immigration prison in Texas, the staff take sexual advantage of the prisoners.  In ordinary language, a prisoner is anyone kept in prison. When the authorities try to impose distinctions, with words such as "detainee", I think that is a plan to avoid the odium of the word "prisoner" for cases such as these. Why help them? I call these people "prisoner".  06 October 2014 (Clinton admits anti-democratic meddling)  Clinton admits in her book that, while claiming to support returning Zelaya to the presidency of Honduras, she was actually moving secretly to prevent his return.  06 October 2014 (Urgent: Labeling "pink slime")  US citizens: call on the USDA to require labeling of food containing ammonia-treated meat, "pink slime".  06 October 2014 (Expensive unnecessary dental work)  Dentists in the US are increasingly likely to recommend expensive unnecessary dental work.  This appears to be due to the economic pressure placed on dentists by changes in dentistry, including large companies with hundreds of offices.  06 October 2014 (Universal basic health care)  The Ebola epidemic shows the need for universal basic health care to extend even to the poorest places.  06 October 2014 (Strong target for energy efficiency)  The UK could boost the economy, and not only for the wealthy, by setting a strong target for energy efficiency.  The government is not interested, perhaps because it aims to make workers desperate and penurious, not make jobs.  06 October 2014 (Phone call metadata)  UK thugs used a journalist's phone call metadata to identify a source, after a judge told them they were not entitled to that information.  They used the notorious R.I.P. act, which was the death knell for privacy of communications in the UK. This law also makes it a crime not to answer thugs' questions.  06 October 2014 (PISSI's script)  If you want to "do something" about PISSI (aka ISIS), be careful you are not following their script.  06 October 2014 (Global heating threatens agriculture)  Latin America has mostly eliminated hunger, but global heating threatens to bring it back by damaging agriculture.  A growing population won't help.  06 October 2014 (US thugs attacking CopWatch)  US thugs around the country are attacking CopWatch groups and their leaders with threats and even bogus arrests.  Is spitting in a thug's face really a felony? If so, the first step in ending the thugs' reign of terror is to change that law &mdash; and many others with it. Thugs regularly abuse their power; they must have less of it.  06 October 2014 (Support for HK protests)  Some US dissidents are claiming that the Hong Kong protests are a US plot.  Those critics seem to be more anti-US than pro-freedom.  If the US is indeed supporting the protests in Hong Kong, I'm glad that for once it is doing something good. I'd say the same thing if it were demonstrated that China or Venezuela had supported Occupy Wall Street or other legitimate democratic activity in the US.  06 October 2014 (HeForShe manifesto)  I support Emma Watson's HeForShe manifesto.  It took me a while to find it in textual form; I don't want to link to a video that would lead people to run nonfree software.  06 October 2014 (Using TTIP to attack regulations)  Chemical companies are using the TTIP to attack regulations to protect against toxic chemical spills.  06 October 2014 (Monopolies on old drugs)  An inexpensive 20-year-old drug for an unusual medical condition may soon cost patients $80,000, due to a legal maneuver by drug barons.  The long-known generic drug colchicine, used for gout, was made a monopoly through a similar maneuver.  The same sort of corrupt scheme for new monopolies on old drugs exists in Europe. These monopolies, applied to drugs that were already available, are an  additional reason to distrust everything drug companies say to argue for patents on even new medicines. I think they just want monopolies.  06 October 2014 (Continued support for Afghan gov't)  Obama has signed an agreement with the contrived Afghan government to keep propping it up for 10 more years.  06 October 2014 (NSA snooping "authorized")  Most NSA snooping is "authorized" by Reagan's executive order 12333. This snooping has no oversight by Congress or courts. Although the government says this is to prevent "terrorism", that is nothing more than an all-purpose excuse.  06 October 2014 (Video games)  A list of ethical issues that someone else sees in regard to video games.  I agree with most of them, but conspicuously absent is the direct injustice that most video games commit against their users: the game software is not free/libre. Indeed, the article goes so far as to condemn "unsanctioned clones" for being "free" (i.e., gratis, not freedom-respecting). That's where I disagree with the article.  06 October 2014 (Facing an age of extinction)  Humanity is pounding the natural world so hard that even common species are not safe from extinction. Many species that humans depend on face extinction.  Don't forget that a the species that inspire human interest, such as tigers, orangutans and pandas, are used for campaigns to protect the entire ecosystems they live in; if we lose them, it will be because we lost the thousands of other species that live along with them.  06 October 2014 (Tories' proposed tax cuts)  The Tories' proposed tax cuts will help only the non-poor, while the benefit cuts to pay for them will shaft the poor.  We've seen similar dooH niboR misdirection from US Republicans, who got support from foolish workers who these same Republicans then impoverish.  05 October 2014 (Urgent: End the siege of Gaza)  US citizens: call on Congress and Obama to direct US diplomacy towards ending the siege of Gaza.  05 October 2014 (Extremists in Japanese gov't)  Right-wing extremists in the Japanese government are denying the facts about forcing women from conquered peoples to act as prostitutes for Japanese soldiers.  The worst crime was committed by the societies that despised these women for the way they were treated. Many of them did not go home after the war, certain their families would reject them.  05 October 2014 (Arming "moderate" Syrian rebels)  Obama's strategy of arming "moderate" Syrian rebels to defeat PISSI is fantasy, and even confirmed Syrian enemies of Assad say so.  Even a right-wing commentator acknowledges this.  So did Obama, not long ago. (Search the article for "fantasy".)  On the other hand, if the Turkish army is willing to fight PISSI in Syria, it could win. Since Turkey is mainly Sunni, Syrian Sunnis who fear Assad would massacre them for their sect could trust Turkey not to do that. (Turkey is no great defender of human rights, but it may be good enough for this.) This might enable the Syrian Sunnis to reject PISSI.  Other things could go wrong: the Turkish army might start fighting Kurds in Syria, for instance. But there is hope of avoiding that.  There are many problems with Obama's plan for dealing with PISSI.  5 October 2014 (Senate)  If the Senate continues blocking the small reform of the "USA Freedom Act", parts of it will  expire entirely next year.  Let's hope so.  5 October 2014 (2022 Olympic Games)  Four cities have dropped their bids for the 2022 Olympic Games, because the  IOC demands too much money.  The only remaining bids are from corrupt, tyrannical countries which don't care.  5 October 2014 (Turkish) As PISSI closes in on Kobani, Turkish troops  have not intervened.  05 October 2014 (Hong Kong anti-protesters)  A Hong Kong opposition legislator accuses the government of sending gangsters to attack the protesters.  It looks like the thugs, or some of them, cooperated with the gangsters.  Even if some of the anti-protesters are being honest about their motives, they are unpatriotic to put their immediate income above democracy. Shame on them!  Naturally, China's imposed "chief executive" cites the danger of more such nonuniformed attacks against the protests as an excuse to order a uniformed attack against the protest. That's tyrant logic for you. We should be prepared to denounce it when we see it in our own countries.  05 October 2014 (Ignoring global heating)  The more subtle form of global heating denial: rather than denying outright that fossil fuels are making the Earth hotter, simply ignoring this in discussing issues where it is significant.  05 October 2014 (Netanyahu's and Abbas's UN speeches)  Uri Avnery: What do Netanyahu's and Abbas's UN speeches mean?  05 October 2014 (Investment in renewable energy)  Naomi Klein says, although private businesses invest in renewable energy for their own interests, we need four times as much investment as what they are doing, and there is no reason to expect businesses to go that far without the state's help or pressure.  The enormous government subsidies for fossil fuels are pertinent here, because they push the market towards fossil fuels, and will continue to do so. Transferring the subsidy to renewables would push the market towards renewables, and a carbon tax would do likewise.  05 October 2014 (Sunni tribal leaders distrust Obama)  Sunni tribal leaders in Iraq do not trust Obama's new "Iraqi government" not to oppress them, so they feel they must stay on the side of PISSI.  05 October 2014 (Koch brothers' toxic empire)  The Koch brothers' toxic empire is toxic to the financial system as well as to the biosphere.  05 October 2014 (Labeling food with GMOs)  Labeling food with GMOs will cost food businesses a total of less than a penny per day per consumer.  05 October 2014 (Bloodthirsty republicans)  Bloodthirsty republicans want to kill people who try to get into the White House, rather than arresting them.  05 October 2014 (Americans should be protesting, too)  Lessig: Americans should be protesting for democracy like the people of Hong Kong.  05 October 2014 (Holder's Disappointing Tech Legacy)  Holder's Disappointing Tech Legacy.  05 October 2014 (Brain myth)  Debunking the myth that we "only use 10% of our brains".  Every part of the brain gets used in various kinds of mental processes.  05 October 2014 (Thatcher)  Margaret Thatcher was planning to call striking miners, and the whole Labour Party, "the enemy within", more or less traitors. Only an opportune terrorist bombing led her to change her rhetoric. But her systematic state violence and frame-ups made her the real "enemy within".  Millions of Britons had good reason to celebrate Thatcher's death, but her successors today are pushing far beyond Thatcher to push them into penury. Today's Tories don't speak with venom about the non-rich but kick them harder.  Companies with Links to Tories "Have Won £1.5bn Worth of NHS Contracts."  If the NHS contracts work out to companies, the companies will get their profits by squeezing either the patients or the employees. Such contracts should not be allowed at all.  05 October 2014 (Being self-employed)  Nowadays, being self-employed mostly means doing an unglamorous job with no job security and does not get a living wage.  Being an entrepreneur (not counting funded startups) means taking a risk with your money &mdash; gambling on your success. There's a small chance you will make a lot, and a big chance you will lose all.  You shouldn't gamble what you can't afford to lose, and nowadays most Americans (and Britons) are so close to the edge that they can't afford to lose anything. Therefore, it is foolish for them to be "entrepreneurial". When politicians say they want most people to be "entrepreneurial," it means they intend to make most people's lives risky.  05 October 2014 (Guantanamo force-feeding videos)  Judge Kessler ordered the US government to publish videos of force-feeding in Guantanamo.  05 October 2014 (Russian proxy invasion of Ukraine)  The Russian proxy invasion of Ukraine is trying to capture Donetsk airport with tanks.  05 October 2014 (Profiting from US prisoners)  US prisons make prisoners pay for food, medical care, even toilet paper. If relatives want to give prisoners money for this, they have to go thru companies that take almost half the money.  The other way prisoners can pay for this is by working, for a pittance, for private companies, thus undermining the standard of living for Americans not in prison.  It should be forbidden for the government to contract parts of its operations to companies in this way. They should all be done by people with civil service jobs. But prison should not make prisoners or their poor relatives pay for what they need either to live, to be healthy, or to be rehabilitated.  And when prisoners work for companies, they must be paid the prevailing wage for the work they do.  04 October 2014 (Very urgent: Oppose neonicotinoid dose increase)  US citizens: oppose Syngenta's request to increase the dose of bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticides.  04 October 2014 (DRM in coffee machines)  Keurig, the company that brought DRM to coffee machines, is being sued in Canada for it.  04 October 2014 (Plutocrats targeting middle class)  Now that the plutocrats have reduced UK workers to penury, they are targeting what's left of the middle class.  04 October 2014 (Tar sands strip mining in Utah)  Protesters oppose tar sand strip mining in Utah. As in Canada, these mines cause tremendous local environmental damage while advancing global heating disaster.  04 October 2014 (Obama's justification for attacking PISSI)  Obama says that PISSI is part of al-Qa'ida, as justification for attacking PISSI, even though the two are fighting each other.  Reportedly al-Nusra recently said it was allying with PISSI. If that really happens, it would validate Obama's argument.  However, I don't think the US should be authorized to make war everywhere in the world by a 13-year-old vote.  03 October 2014 (Urgent: Support network neutrality)  US citizens: call on the other Democratic FCC commissioners to support network neutrality.  03 October 2014 (Non-denial denials)  Non-denial denials should make reporters suspicious.  03 October 2014 (Judging women by their femininity)  Sexism in everyday life manifests by judging women by their femininity, even in contexts where their capabilities and achievements are more pertinent.  03 October 2014 (The killing of Palestinians suspected of murder)  In Israel, even ministers describe the killing of Palestinians suspected of murder as an "assassination", and the official in charge says he chose not to try to arrest them.  (This is the last of several topics covered in the article.)  03 October 2014 (Sweden will officially recognize Palestine)  Sweden will officially recognize Palestine.  03 October 2014 (European convention on human rights)  The Tories would withdraw the UK from the the European convention on human rights.  03 October 2014 (Turkey will fight to protect Kobani from PISSI)  Turkey will fight to protect Kobani from PISSI.  I too wonder why the US does not destroy PISSI's tanks that are operating there. There is very little danger of mistaking civilians for a tank.  03 October 2014 (Loss of biodiversity)  Humanity is not on track to meet its commitment to slow down the rate of loss of biodiversity.  03 October 2014 (Hong Kong protest movement)  The "CEO" of Hong Kong refused to resign but agreed to talks with the protest movement.  In Hong Kong, 1000 enemies of democracy attacked 100 democracy protesters.  03 October 2014 (Mass haul-out of walrus)  The mass haul-out of walrus is a symptom of damage to a specific ocean ecosystem that depends on sea ice. With more heating, eventually there won't be any sea ice.  03 October 2014 (Paywall Protected Torrent)  Thom Yorke Sells New Album via Paywall Protected Torrent.  This is much more ethical than other internet music sale schemes. The only thing wrong with it is that paying requires identification and nonfree Javascript code. (We've verified that free bittorrent clients work.)  If they accepted anonymous payment and didn't require Javascript to pay, I could endorse it.  03 October 2014 (Construction in Gaza)  Israel is pressuring the UN to strictly control all construction in Gaza on Israel's behalf.  03 October 2014 (EPA has power to ban mountaintop mines)  A court ruled the EPA has the power to ban mountaintop mines. Now the EPA needs to do this broadly.  Civilization's survival depends on greatly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Making coal (and other fossil fuels) scare is a great way to make the market boost investment in renewables.  03 October 2014 (Urgent: Impeach judge Fuller)  US citizens: call on Congress to impeach judge Fuller.  03 October 2014 (Global heating)  Australia's record hot September, a year ago, would have been a freak occurrence 50 years ago. Global heating has made it a fairly likely event that will happen once every 6 years or so.  03 October 2014 (Export of uranium from Australia)  Australia proposes to drop previous nuclear weapons controls when exporting uranium to India.  03 October 2014 (Obama's demand for secret hearing)  A US judge rejected Obama's demand for a secret hearing about the torture of Guantanamo force feeding.  03 October 2014 (Germany imposes internet filtering)  Germany imposes internet filtering on routers (which I suppose includes those in ISPs as well as those in people's homes), blocking sites with no trial, and claims that the names of the censored sites are a "secret".  A site that posted the list of blocked domains was threatened with blockage itself.  Germany also made a rather shocking claim that posting this list in the US is illegal under US law, on the grounds that some of the censored sites display "child pornography".  Some works are disgusting, but censorship is more disgusting.  "Child pornography" is an all-purpose excuse to attack human rights on the internet. The FBI and Holder are now using it as an excuse to demand to be able to snoop on everyone's computers. This "cure" is worse than the disease.  02 October 2014 (Urgent: Global Frackdown on Oct 11)  Everyone: Participate in the Global Frackdown on Oct 11.  02 October 2014 (Urgent: Unblock voters' registrations)  US citizens: call on Georgia to stop blocking 50,000 voters' registrations.  02 October 2014 (Urgent: Smarter Sentencing Act)  US citizens: call on Congress to pass the Smarter Sentencing Act.  02 October 2014 (Transporting oil by rail)  Railroad companies want to take 7 years to replace the explosion-prone tanker cars used for transporting oil.  Instead, transporting oil should simply be banned starting now. Any time some activity with fossil fuel causes a second problem in addition to global heating, we should ban that activity. If we ban enough of them, it may reduce the use of fossil fuel enough to avert global heating disaster.  03 October 2014 (New York City seawall)  New York City is building a 10-mile-long seawall/recreation-area to prevent flooding for a few decades.  If we don't stop pumping CO2 into the air, no seawall will protect New York City.  02 October 2014 (Religious extremists in Florida)  A town in Florida is under the perpetual legal control of a rich religious extremist who gets support from religious extremist elected officials and religious extremists on the Supreme Court.  02 October 2014 (Goldman Sachs and the Federal Reserve)  Leaked recordings show that the Federal Reserve is too cozy with Goldman Sachs.  This may be partly because the Federal Reserve is owned by private banks.  02 October 2014 (Protesters block Israeli ship in Florida)  US protests blocking unloading of Israeli ships have spread to Tampa.  02 October 2014 (Nobel peace summit cancelled)  A meeting of Nobel peace prize winners was cancelled because South Africa would not give the Dalai Lama a visa to attend.  02 October 2014 (US media supports tyranny in Egypt)  US media supported democracy in Egypt for 6 weeks, but is now firmly (with the US government) on the side of military repression.  02 October 2014 (Sudan flogs women)  In Sudan, women get flogged for not covering their hair. Jailing is common, for women who aren't totally submissive.  02 October 2014 (Corruption in UK's cabinet)  Corruption has been discovered at the center of the UK's cabinet, in someone who is not a minister.  The ministers are overtly corrupt.  02 October 2014 (Spyware to "protect children")  US thugs and prosecutors are distributing software to "protect children", which is really spyware.  Americans are so insanely obsessed with overprotecting children that you can get them to swallow almost any form of abuse in the name of doing that.  02 October 2014 (Euro-zone austerity)  Stiglitz: The euro-zone austerity has caused tremendous harm, all of which could have been avoided.  If you judge these budget cuts in terms of the supposed goals of nations' policies, they are failure. But they are very effective as an intentional shock (as Naomi Klein puts it) to transfer wealth to the plutocrats.  01 October 2014 (Space debris)  Small satellites, "cubesats", are being placed in long-lived orbits thus increasing the danger of collisions that generate space debris.  The disaster shown in the movie Gravity is in fact happening, though far more slowly than in the movie. The question is whether we can find a way to stop it.  In the mean time, we should not do stupid things that are likely to speed it up.  01 October 2014 (Israeli soldiers aid fanatics)  Israeli fanatics, aided by soldiers, forced a Palestinian family out of its apartment in Jerusalem.  The army regularly helps them establish outposts that the government says it has not authorized. (It is misleading to call only these colonies "illegal", since they are all illegal under international law.)  The army demolished an apartment building in Abu Dis, a Palestinian town just across the annexation wall from Jerusalem, not giving the inhabitants time to remove their belongings.  The Palestinian Authority had given permission to build additional three floors, but Israel treats those permits as invalid as an excuse to practice systematic harassment of Palestinians.  01 October 2014 (Facebook)  Facebook now allows people to use aliases,  but only if they are generally known by those aliases.  This is not much better than the previous "real names" policy. You can't have one account to show your boss and your parents and another for your friends.  01 October 2014 (Putin)  Putin remains, in spirit, a Soviet secret policeman who watched the East German tyranny collapse. He is determined to attack any challenge to the regime pre-emptively,  to prevent protesters from winning.  Nothing will convince Putin let go, but sooner or later he will die or become incapacitated. Economic sanctions against Russia may convince Putin's successors not to continue his tyranny.  01 October 2014 (Single Mothers) Single Mothers Are the Real Casualties in  Cameron's Class War.   01 October 2014 (Israel) Israel agreed to allow Gazans to fish 6 miles from shore, but unilaterally went back on the agreement,  and has attacked fishermen just a mile from shore.  01 October 2014 (Hong Kong Students)  Some Hong Kong students are preparing for a  theoretical Chinese invasion.  01 October 2014 (Wealth Hampers)  How concentration of wealth hampers efforts to  make a sustainable civilization.  01 October 2014 (Fracking)   Another danger from fracking: mining the fine-grain sand  it uses can poison water and air.  01 October 2014 (The UK Grown in GDP)  The UK has grown in GDP since the economic crisis, but workers' pay remains lower  than it was before the crisis.  The average decrease is just a few percent, so the UK government plans  to cut aid to the working poor.  The Tories won't be satisfied until they have millions of Britons living in closets.  01 October 2014 (Commercial) A commercial carbon-capture coal-burning  power plant has opened.  In principle this can be part of a solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If other forms of fossil fuel are cheaper, a simple tax can make them more expensive. Subsidizing fossil fuel use is harmful, but subsidizing a decrease in the CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use makes sense.   01 October 2014 (Gaza) Uri Avnery: Palestinian President Abbas offers Israel a partner for negotiations, provided the  negotiations are sincere. Avnery says it is an exaggeration to call the attack on Gaza "genocide", but according to the official definition,  the accusation may be valid.   This case, imposing destructive conditions of life on a part of the targeted people that are likely to kill some fraction of the victims, but nowhere near all of the victims, seems to be an edge case. I tend to think it should not be considered genocide. The official definition may be a little too broad, depending on how it is interpreted. However, I think that is a side issue. Provoking a war as an opportunity to kill and wound 10,000 people is a great crime regardless of whether it qualifies as "genocide".   01 October 2014 (Economic Growth) It's Time to Shout Stop on This War  on the Living World. The world needs economic growth for the benefit of the poor, which can be done together with less waste for the rich; but that is not what plutocratic governments are likely to do.   01 October 2014 (Neocons) Neocons hope to pressure Obama into attacking  Assad as well as PISSI. (PISSI is the Pseudo-Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.)  01 October 2014 (California) California has implemented "gun restraining orders": if you feel a relative is likely to shoot people, you can ask a  judge to order his guns taken away.   01 October 2014 (Israel)  In Israel, people who disagree with prevailing hatred of Palestinians  are fired, attacked, and get death threats.   01 October 2014 (UK Torture) Moazzam Begg, former Guantanamo prisoner and now human rights investigator, was imprisoned in the UK and accused of terrorism after he went to Syria to investigate evidence of UK torture.  He has now been freed. The UK government will violate any rights to prevent the facts about its torture from being brought out in court.   01 October 2014 (Antarctica)  The loss of ice in Antarctica is big enough to affect the Earth's gravity  as measured by satellites.   Melting is unlikely to continue at 500 cubic kilometers per year. The greenhouse gases we have already emitted will make the atmosphere hotter, and melting will speed up.  01 October 2014 (Florida)  Florida thugs tased and arrested a woman as she was walking away after  asking about arrests of other people. I wonder whether she was concerned on general principles or because she saw something that looked wrong.   01 October 2014 (Media) How US corporate media promote  US wars.  01 October 2014 (European Commission)  MEPs are concerned that the European Commission wants to cancel  conservation policies and deregulate instead.  Deregulation of business means that plutocrats have less in their way as they build businesses that make profit for them while poisoning you.   01 October 2014 (Syria)  A food aid worker in Syria tweeted the coordinates of a bunker being used by PISSI. PISSI says it  will kill him for this.   This shows why humanitarian aid workers should remain neutral &mdash; so that they can get the support of all sides in a conflict.   01 October 2014 ("Intelligence Agencies")  The US spends almost 70 billion dollars a year on "intelligence agencies", but they hardly ever predict the major events  that the US might rationally want them to predict. They probably do a good job of suppressing many journalists and protesters.  01 October 2014 (Walruses)  The lack of sea ice has forced 35,000 walruses to go ashore in Alaska, rather than resting on sea ice to  take quick trips to feed.  This surely makes it hard for them to eat, and will therefore interfere with reproduction.  01 October 2014 (Hong Kong)  China's efforts to keep the public ignorant of protests in Hong Kong  show occasional slips. Nonetheless, we have found no way to defeat the tyranny of internet censorship, which has spread to many supposedly "free" countries including France and the UK.  01 October 2014 (Ebola) The US public health defenses that prevent an outbreak  of Ebola in the US.  The scandal is that extractivism and short-sightedness won't let Sierra Leone and Liberia have the medical systems necessary to prevent Ebola outbreaks there.   01 October 2014 ("Invisible Art") A hoax about a show of "invisible art"  satirizes the art world. The most bizarre part is that there really  is invisible "art".  01 October 2014 (Coal Burning) Modi's government plans a big increase in coal burning, and hopes that a parallel investment in renewable energy will distract from the fact that this pushes  human civilization closer to the invisible edge of the cliff.   01 October 2014 (Zero-Waste Restaurant)  A zero-waste (or else recycled materials)  restaurant in the UK.  01 October 2014 (Water Supply)  A US court declined to stop Detroit from continuing to shut off  poor residents' water supply.  Citizens plan to continue their resistance.  01 October 2014 (Pakistan)  Polio is resurging in Pakistan as a result of religious extremists  that fight against vaccination.   01 October 2014 (60 Students)  A gang of Mexican thugs killed and kidnaped around 60 students, perhaps because the thugs are  connected with a drug gang.  01 October 2014 (Abortions)   In Mexico (aside from one state), women are imprisoned for years for having abortions.  01 October 2014 (Privacy)  Outgoing  Attorney General Holder has joined the US government campaign against online privacy.  01 October 2014 (Aral Sea) The former Aral Sea dried up completely  this summer.  01 October 2014 (Military Equipment)  Many US thug departments want to return military equipment that the Pentagon says is "on loan" to them, but the Pentagon  won't take the equipment back.  01 October 2014 (Urgent: Mortgages)  US citizens: tell HUD to stop selling mortgages to wall street.  01 October 2014 (Urgent: Poultry inspections)  US citizens: call on the USDA to abandon its plan to let poultry companies do their own inspections.  Only a government working for the foxes would put them in charge of the hen house.  01 October 2014 (Non-plutocratic policies in Brazil)  Brazil's government has successfully given a larger fraction of GNP to the non-rich, lifting millions out of poverty, by adopting non-plutocratic policies.  01 October 2014 ("Open-plan" offices)  "Open-plan" offices appear to harm workers' health and productivity.  I wonder why businesses use them. The savings in rent can hardly be enough to be the reason.  01 October 2014 (Snooping on the entire internet)  The Australian spy agency can get permission to snoop on the entire internet by getting just one warrant.  01 October 2014 (Referendum on "blasphemy" in Ireland)  Ireland will have a referendum on abolishing the crime of "blasphemy".  30 September 2014 (Urgent: End sports tax exemption)  US citizens: support taking away tax exemption from professional sports leagues.  30 September 2014 (World Bank carbon offset plan)  A World Bank carbon offset plan involved kicking people off their lands so that a forest could grow.  This is a fundamental conflict, and human population growth makes it worse.  30 September 2014 (Growth of renewable energy)  The UK Conservatives are so embarrassed by the growth of renewable energy that they have decided not to report statistics on it.  They are in cahoots with fossil fuel and nuclear power companies, for which this growth is an inconvenient embarrassment.  30 September 2014 (Obama trying to cover up torture)  Obama is trying to cover up torture by holding Guantanamo torture hearings in secret.  30 September 2014 (Detroit's water shutoffs)  Detroit's water shutoffs for the poor have been approved by a plutocratic court.  30 September 2014 (Obama regime wants more nuclear weapons)  The Obama regime wants to spend lots of money making more plutonium cores for nuclear weapons. Never mind that the US has lots of extra ones in storage.  30 September 2014 (US hospitals in HMOs outsource ER doctors)  US hospitals in HMOs hire doctors in the emergency room who are not in the HMO &mdash; so that the doctors can gouge patients.  30 September 2014 (News coverage with CIA approval)  A former LA Times reporter, covering the CIA, showed his stories to the CIA to get approval of them.  30 September 2014 (Gitmo Hunger Strikes)  Gitmo Hunger Strikes Are a Cry for Help. Why Is the US Fighting Back with Secret Torture?  30 September 2014 (Apple may have to return tens of millions of euros)  Apple may have to return tens of millions of euros in illegal state funds to the Irish state.  30 September 2014 (The misogyny of ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel)  The misogyny of ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel spills over constantly to seating on airlines.  When it happens on airlines, it is funny, but in Israel it makes secular Jews think of emigrating. I don't think Arabs will destroy Israel (most of the governments no longer even say they want to). Orthodox theocracy will do it.  30 September 2014 (Nicaragua's planned canal)  Nicaragua's planned canal would destroy and pollute forests where endangered species live.  I have to wonder whether a railroad might do a better job. Now that containers make it quick and easy to load and unload ships, the time it takes to move cargo from ship to train is only a matter of how long a ship must wait to be unloaded. Building more port facilities can reduce that to any level.  A train line could carry the containers from one shore to the other faster than a ship could go through the canal. If one train line isn't enough, even ten parallel tracks would hurt the forest and the surrounding inhabitants less than a canal.  Animals can run across the tracks, but it would be easy to make bridges across the train lines since trains are much less tall than ships.  30 September 2014 (Occupy Central with Love & Peace (Hong Kong))  Press Release by Occupy Central with Love & Peace (Hong Kong).  Mass protests have succeeded in Hong Kong before.  30 September 2014 (Hottest ever recorded spring and summer)  Australia's hottest ever recorded spring and summer, a year ago, were 2000 times more likely due to the global heating that has occurred in recent decades.  30 September 2014 (Killing of John Crawford)  Comparing the video of the killing of John Crawford with what the thugs said had happened shows their story was false.  The thugs call that "testilying".  30 September 2014 (Sentenced to death for an underground abortion)  A nurse in Kenya has been sentenced to death for an underground abortion which went wrong, but Kenya's restrictive abortion law is the real killer.  30 September 2014 (Earth has lost half its wild animals since 40 years ago)  WWF estimates that Earth has lost half its wild animals since 40 years ago. They have been wiped out by human activity and its consequences.  I think the count refers to vertebrates only.  30 September 2014 (Urgent: End prison quota system)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to put an end to the quota system for keeping unauthorized immigrants in prison.  The quota system means that they always keep the prison full, and if there aren't enough unauthorized immigrants that there's a reason to imprison, they have to fill the bed with someone else that there is no reason to imprison. It's as wrong as giving thugs a daily quota for traffic tickets.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  30 September 2014 (Iran executes religious innovator)  Iran executed a religious innovator for "heresy".  For cover, other charges were listed with no evidence presented.  30 September 2014 (Changes in political views)  Old people change their political and ethical views as much as younger adults, and they tend to change in the direction of greater tolerance.  30 September 2014 (Australian uranium)  Is it right or wrong for Australia to mine and export uranium?  30 September 2014 (NDA for cell phone snooping devices)  The FCC requires local thug departments to sign a nondisclosure agreement with the FBI, as an excuse to keep the use of cell phone snooping devices secret.  The text of the NDA itself is also secret. Nice of them to at least admit that the contract is an NDA.  30 September 2014 (Racism in the US)  Racism in the US is more pervasive than even black Americans realize.  30 September 2014 (Private sex lives none of our business)  So [Tory Minister] Brooks Newmark Sent Some Explicit Pictures &mdash; Why Should He Resign?  I am glad to see prominent rejection of the absurdly exaggerated importance given to politician's private sex lives. The same foolish idea was the basis for impeaching President Clinton.  That Tory minister is not fit to be in office because he's on the plutocratic side. The same was true of Clinton. Their sex lives were none of our business and not relevant at all.  30 September 2014 (Russia wants social media data)  Russia will block access to Facebook, Twitter and Google unless they register and keep all data on Russian users in Russia.  That policy would make the users safer (perhaps) from NSA spying but more vulnerable to spying by the ex-KGB. For people in Russia, the Russian state is much more of a threat than the American state, so this law oppresses them.  By contrast, the European Union has better data protection law than the US, so requiring European users' data to be kept in Europe is an improvement in their privacy.  However, that improvement will only fully take effect if the EU prevents the US from subpoena'ing user data that subsidiaries of US companies keep in Europe.  30 September 2014 (Hong Kong protests)  Hong Kong Surprises Itself with the Exuberance And Spontaneity of Protests.  Thugs were unable to shut the protests down.  So the government withdrew the thugs.  30 September 2014 (Protesters block Israeli ship in California)  Protesters have again blocked an Israeli ship from unloading cargo in the port of Oakland.  30 September 2014 (Syrian al Qa'ida affiliate joins PISSI)  The al Qa'ida affiliate in Syria has joined up with PISSI (the pseudo-Islamic state). This will simplify Obama's argument that Congressional authorization for war against al Qa'ida covers fighting PISSI.  Fighting PISSI might offer a path towards ending the fighting between Assad and the other Syrian rebels.  29 September 2014 (PISSI)  What to call the theocratic state in Syria and Iraq? Calling it the "Islamic State" endorses their claim to represent Islam. That's dubious, since most Muslims say otherwise; it also plays into their hands.  Since it stands for a twisted and distorted version of Islam, it is really a pseudo-Islamic state. Thus, I propose PISSI, for Pseudo-Islamic State of Syria and Iraq.  29 September 2014 (Trusting Apple?)  Can we trust Apple's improved support for users' privacy?  29 September 2014 (Ignoring global heating)  Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore [Global Heating] And What To Do about It.  29 September 2014 (Remote car shutoff devices)  Car loans in the US now come with remote control car shutoff devices.  I don't think this should be allowed.  29 September 2014 (ACLU suing Oklahoma thugs)  The ACLU is suing Oklahoma thugs over their private network for keeping records on lots of citizens.  29 September 2014 (UK repeats mistake by fighting ISIS)  A member of B'liar's cabinet says that the UK, by fighting ISIS, is repeating the mistake he made.  29 September 2014 (Ferguson thug chief's apology)  The Ferguson thug chief apologized for a secondary detail of the killing of Michael Brown. His apology has not been accepted.  29 September 2014 (Man tortured to death by Taliban)  The Taliban captured a visiting Afghan-Australian and tortured him to death, apparently just because of his ethnic group.  29 September 2014 (New solar electricity generators)  A new invention uses 80% of incoming sunlight to generate electricity and desalinate water.  29 September 2014 (Bullies obstruct free expression)  What Price Artistic Freedom When the Bullies Turn Up?  29 September 2014 (What ISIS may gain from air strikes)  "What the Isis jihadis lose in strength from the air strikes they may gain in legitimacy".  29 September 2014 (Urgent: Take action for real net neutrality)  US citizens: call on Obama to take action for real net neutrality.  29 September 2014 (Retirement benefits)  The Washington Post recommends governments cut retirement benefits for government employees, so Bezos (its new owner) decided to do this to the staff of the Washington Post.  29 September 2014 (Veterans of the Bush forces suing)  Veterans of the Bush forces are suing to get precise information about where DU (dirty uranium) weapons were used, to gauge whether they were exposed to this carcinogen.  29 September 2014 (Urgent: No Federal Contracts for Corporate Deserters Act)  US citizens: support the No Federal Contracts for Corporate Deserters Act.  28 September 2014 (Modi went to New York)  Indian Prime Minister Modi went to New York for a triumph but encountered a lawsuit from victims of the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat that he is suspected of encouraging.  28 September 2014 (Commercial photography banned in federal wildlife)  The US Forest Service claims to have banned commercial photography (including for journalism) in federal wildlife areas.  28 September 2014 (Prison employee raped by a prisoner)  A Pennsylvania prison employee was raped by a prisoner, and the state claimed in court that it was the employee's fault.  28 September 2014 (Urgent: Phone Walmart)  Everyone: phone Walmart at 1-800-WALMART to tell that company to give Thelma Moore her job back. She was fired for being injured while pregnant.  28 September 2014 (Proposed European Commissioner for the environment)  The proposed European Commissioner for the environment seems to be tied to Malta's policy allowing mass shooting of migrating birds, and people suspect his choice was part of a larger plan to sabotage EU environmental protection.  28 September 2014 (Effects of global heating)  Effects of global heating are causing damage around the world, even though it is just the beginning.  If you are young and in the US, you may become an environmental refugee later in this century.  28 September 2014 (Privately run NHS hospital neglecting patients)  The one privately run NHS hospital in Britain has been neglecting patients.  Why am I not surprised?  28 September 2014 (Collective punishment)  An in-depth study shows that a feeling of being subject to collective punishment is a primary ingredient in the making of a terrorist fanatic.  28 September 2014 (Head of FBI condemned tech companies)  The head of the FBI condemned tech companies that have improved security against massive surveillance, saying they are helping people "place themselves beyond the law".  That's a falsehood; people have no legal obligation to open their window shades to help the FBI spy on their private lives. It is the US spy agencies that have placed itself "beyond the law".  28 September 2014 (African palm oil)  Will African palm oil be produced by local farmers or by corporate plantations?  28 September 2014 (Urgent: New attorney general)  US citizens: call on Obama to choose a new attorney general that will stop the cruelty of the War on Drugs.  28 September 2014 (Urgent: Google funding politicians that deny global heating)  Everyone: call on Google to stop funding politicians that deny global heating.  Here's info on how Google funds them (and other companies too).  28 September 2014 (Urgent: Stop supporting ALEC)  Everyone: Phone Ebay and call on that company to stop supporting ALEC.  ALEC pushes plutocratic laws at the state level in the US.  28 September 2014 (Why The Islamic State Is Not Islamic)  Why The Islamic State Is Not Islamic.  I am thinking about using another name for it; perhaps Da'esh.  28 September 2014 (Sham "peace negotiations")  Abbas, speaking to the UN, condemned the US-sponsored sham "peace negotiations" and said that any new negotiations must be aimed at creating an independent Palestine.  28 September 2014 (Different way to deal with ISIS)  Groups that campaign for peace generally oppose Obama's new war in Iraq and Syria. They recommend a different way to deal with ISIS.  I support providing air support to the armies fighting ISIS armies. I've explained why that is urgently needed, and less likely to result in civilian casualties.  Aside from that, I agree with the peace groups.  28 September 2014 (Housing: a Political Problem)  Housing: How Many Have to Be Unable to Afford It Before It Becomes a Political Problem?  28 September 2014 (Expanding use of natural gas)  Expanding use of natural gas in the US will increase future carbon emissions.  28 September 2014 (Soft on criminal big business)  Attorney General Holder has made a habit of going soft on criminal big business.  27 September 2014 (Voluntary cooperation)  Psychology explains how Burning Man creates a high level of voluntary cooperation.  The word "market" means buying and selling. To use that word to refer to altruistic cooperation is an abuse of language; I am not going to use the word that way.  27 September 2014 (Australia's new ban on journalism)  Australia's new ban on journalism will imprison journalists and their sources.  If it had been in effect two years ago, articles we have read about Australia's spying would have led to imprisonment of the authors.  27 September 2014 (Uzbek political prisoners)  Uzbekistan holds thousands of political prisoners.  27 September 2014 (How biometric ID in the US began)  Biometric ID in the US began as a scheme to stop slaves from escaping.  27 September 2014 (Thugs acting fast)  The thugs that killed John Crawford had recently seen a video encouraging them to act fast against people who are shooting other people.  Great work, except that they didn't stop to find that out that John Crawford was not shooting anyone.  27 September 2014 (Facebook rats)  Julian Assange: 'When you post to Facebook, you're being a rat.'  I've stated the same point in my speeches for a few years, asking people not to post photos of me to Facebook and explaining why.  27 September 2014 (Marijuana legalization campaign in Alaska)  Charlo Greene's boosted the marijuana legalization campaign in Alaska by quitting her TV job on the air.  27 September 2014 (The CIA-cocaine scandal story)  The CIA helped a few major US newspapers nitpick the CIA-cocaine scandal story to death.  It seems unlikely that the people in charge of each of those newspapers ordered the major biased efforts spontaneously. It must have been coordinated somehow. Since these CIA documents don't show how, it remains to be investigated.  27 September 2014 (Turkey blocks Syrian border)  Turkey has started blocking the smuggling of oil from ISIS in Syria, but it is also blocking refugees from leaving that part of Syria.  27 September 2014 (Urgent: Limit US war in Iraq and Syria)  US citizens: sign this petition for Congress to limit US war in Iraq and Syria, regarding both time and methods.  27 September 2014 (Minimum wage)  Los Angeles legislated a $15/hr minimum wage for hotel workers in large hotels.  If some hotels move to nearby towns, that will show the whole region ought to have a higher minimum wage.  27 September 2014 (Cambodia unfit to take refugees)  Cambodian protesters say Cambodia doesn't respect human rights enough to be a fit place to send refugees who went to Australia.  27 September 2014 (UK cuts in legal aid)  UK cuts in legal aid are supposedly meant to save money, but they won't do much of that; rather they will deny justice to the non-rich.  27 September 2014 (Liberian food production crippled)  The reaction to Ebola is crippling food production in Liberia.  27 September 2014 (No plan for winning war against ISIS)  The West Has No Plan for Winning the War against Isis &mdash; Only Avoiding Defeat.  27 September 2014 (Indonesia abolishes direct presidential elections)  Indonesia's lame duck parliament voted to abolish direct presidential elections &mdash; which seem to offer too much democracy.  27 September 2014 (Australians protest for renewable energy)  Australians held 30 protests to keep the existing target for renewable energy.  26 September 2014 (US attack on ISIS oil wells)  The US attacked ISIS oil wells and refineries to cut off its funding.  It seems like an intelligent way to damage ISIS, but it risks causing horrible pollution.  26 September 2014 (Pseudoscience in UK schools)  UK schools teach creationist pseudoscience and some universities recognize it academically.  26 September 2014 (EU research on oil spill containment)  A large EU research project for containing oil spills from undersea oil wells has the stated goal of encouraging public support for such wells.  Research on containing spills is a valid goal; risking the spills is not.  26 September 2014 (Germany's genocide in Namibia)  Germany's first 20th century genocide, in Namibia, trained many of the people who carried out Nazi genocide.  26 September 2014 (US high school dress rules)  Students in many US high schools protested the dress rules imposed on girls by the American Taliban, and the nasty punishments used to enforce them.  26 September 2014 (US beer market)  One giant beer conglomerate controls half the US market. Four companies control almost 80%.  That's about as bad as the ISP market, the book publishing market, and the recorded music market.  I think we should take whatever steps are needed so that no company, unless it is a regulated monopoly, controls more than 5% of any field.  27 September 2014 (Cal students under control)  50 years ago, students at UC Berkeley defeated an attempt to control them with censorship. Today, under plutocratic rule, students are controlled with debt they can't pay, because the plutocrats got out of paying taxes.  26 September 2014 (Attacking without UN authorization)  Attacking ISIS in Syria, without authorization from the UN Security Council, violates the treaties that created the UN, and Obama's argument that it is Iraq's right of self-defense is invalid.  If it were valid, it would equally well authorize Assad to bomb Turkey.  The ethical argument that convinces me it is right to bomb ISIS forces in the field as they try to conquer cities and big dams is that we must protect those people from horrible oppression including mass murder. I don't know how that plays out against the UN charter, but that's not the argument Obama made.  26 September 2014 (Urgent: Protest unfair trade treaties)  In Europe: join protests on Oct 11 against unfair trade treaties.  26 September 2014 (Rare bits of nature to be destroyed)  A hill in England that hosts old trees, nightingales and rare butterflies is slated for building; all those things will be lost.  The UK urgently needs more council housing, but that does not require destroying rare bits of nature. It is much better to replace low-density housing near train stations with apartment buildings.  26 September 2014 (Painful experiences)  Advice to distance yourself from painful experiences, not rehearse them as a grievance.  If the painful experience was an injustice, the one feeling you shouldn't try to weaken is your support for others to whom such an injustice happens.  26 September 2014 (Protection of wolves in Wyoming)  The few remaining wolves in Wyoming are once again protected.  Protection enabled wolves to recover, but some states don't like that, and seek to use the successful recovery of the species as an excuse to wipe it out again.  26 September 2014 (Iraqi military a total disaster)  $26 Billion in US Aid Later, the Iraqi Military Is a Total Disaster.  26 September 2014 (Briton charged with blasphemy in Pakistan)  A Briton in Pakistan, who has been charged with blasphemy, survived an assassination attempt by a thug.  This law is why I refuse to visit Pakistan.  I recommend that the US and other countries require all visitors to make a public pledge in support of freedom of speech (which would include condemning laws against "blasphemy") before allowing them to enter.  Pakistan is not the only country that unjustly punishes "blasphemy". In India, web sites can be forcibly shut down if they "offend" any religion. And the  Maldive Islands have imposed censorship on book publishing as part of Muslim extremism.  26 September 2014 (Sierra Leone imposes quarantines)  Sierra Leone has imposed quarantines on large zones containing more than 1/3 of the population.  I am skeptical that this will be effective for stopping the spread of Ebola. Surely there are infected people in each of the zones that the country is now divided into.  26 September 2014 (Unity Gov't control of Gaza)  Fatah and Hamas Agree Deal for Unity Government to Take Control of Gaza.  26 September 2014 (ISIS)  Both the US and Iran have their blind spots when talking about ISIS.  26 September 2014 (California thug agrees to resign)  A thug that punched a woman in California with no grounds has agreed to resign.  Good, but he should be prosecuted.  26 September 2014 (Coal train protest)  A coal train protester says ending coal shipments is the government's job, but since it failed to do its job, the responsibility fell to him.  26 September 2014 (Disrupting military drone manufacturing)  Scottish protesters shut down a factory making components for Israeli military drones.  26 September 2014 (Seattle bans neonicotinoid pesticides)  Seattle has banned neonicotinoid pesticides in the city.  It also will fine people that don't do composting. I am not sure how this is supposed to work for people that live in apartments and have no gardens.  26 September 2014 (US politicians want to cancel citizenships)  US politicians want to cancel the citizenship of people that support ISIS.  There are crimes that we have good reason to punish, some by life imprisonment, but denial of citizenship is never legitimate. (It also violates treaties to make someone stateless.)  Sad to say, the US has a history of revoking citizenship of immigrants for political reasons. For instance, Emma Goldman's US citizenship was revoked because of her political activities: draft resistance and birth control.  26 September 2014 (Repression of gays in Egypt)  Egypt is systematically repressing gays (extralegally) after a video was posted of an unofficial wedding of two men.  26 September 2014 (Prosecution of Romanian prison commander)  In Romania, the commander of a prison under Ceausescu is being prosecuted.  When will the US prosecute people who presided over torture in Guantanamo?  26 September 2014 (Facebook's "real name" policy)  Facebook with its "real name" policy makes itself the arbiter of other people's selves.  26 September 2014 (Students in Colorado protest)  Students in Colorado walked out and protested a right-wing plan for one-sided education in obeying authority.  26 September 2014 (UK to phase out old coal power plants)  Cameron says the UK plans to phase out old coal power plants over the next 15 years, but does not make a clear commitment to replace them with safe renewable power.  26 September 2014 (Human rights NGOs threatened)  Egyptian "president" al-Sisi has made a decree that threatens human rights NGOs with prosecution.  26 September 2014 (Perverse redefinitions of common terms)  What Obama says about fighting in Iraq is misleading due to perverse redefinitions of common terms such as "imminent attack", "civilians", militants" and "ground troops".  26 September 2014 (New Zealand election)  The pro-business party in New Zealand won reelection through a long-term organized practice of smearing opponents through proxies.  26 September 2014 (Spread of Ebola)  Over a million people could be infected with Ebola virus by January if it keeps spreading at the current rate.  26 September 2014 (UK's deportation of Tamil refugees)  Sri Lanka continues to torture Tamils regularly, often demanding information about Tamil refugees in the UK. Meanwhile, the UK continues deporting those refugees to Sri Lanka.  This is prima facie evidence that the UK minister in charge of deportations is callously blind to justice, law and humanity.  26 September 2014 (Obama's speech about global heating)  Bill McKibben critiques Obama's speech about global heating.  26 September 2014 (Urgent: Strict limits on shipping oil on trains)  US citizens: call for strict limits on shipping oil on trains.  26 September 2014 (Urgent: Make commitments for renewable energy)  Everyone: call on Amazon to make commitments for renewable energy.  26 September 2014 (Painful reality of poverty)  Talking about "inequality" covers up the painful reality of poverty.  26 September 2014 (Jailed for a year without charges or lawyers)  The ACLU is suing to free people that Mississippi jailed for as much as a year without charges or lawyers.  26 September 2014 (Massive and broad attack on Australians' freedom)  Australia's government is using far-away ISIS as an excuse for a massive and broad attack on Australians' freedom, including imprisonment of reporters and whistleblowers, massive surveillance, and punishment without trial.  ISIS is a horrible threat to people in Iraq and Syria; for Australia, the danger of ISIS is a pinprick compared with this.  26 September 2014 (John Crawford was not threatening anyone)  Walmart's security camera shows that John Crawford was not threatening anyone, bothering anyone, or pointing the BB rifle at anyone when thugs shot him. He was standing still, talking on his phone.  A passerby told the thugs that Crawford was pointing the BB rifle at people, and the thugs who killed Crawford falsely repeated that claim, but they shot him without taking a couple of seconds of care to check it.  If thugs can get away with this sort of excuse, nobody is safe. However, whites are in less danger than blacks: people are less likely to falsely perceive whites as threatening others, and thugs are less likely to shoot whites before asking questions.  26 September 2014 (Plutocratic extremists in US)  Plutocratic extremists in the US want to set retired people and children against each other, hoping parents will blame the retired and fight them for the dwindling share of the nation's production that plutocrats allow to everyone else.  26 September 2014 (Urgent: Stop trying to patent mutant human genes)  Everyone: call on Myriad Genetics to stop trying to patent mutant human genes.  Of course, what is really needed is a law to eliminate all such patents in Australia, that's no reason not to pressure the companies that try to exploit the existing bad law.  26 September 2014 (Palo Alto's electricity)  Palo Alto's electricity is carbon-neutral, and cheap compared with the rest of California.  However, that doesn't include the cars; there is still a long way to go.  26 September 2014 (Thugs will not be prosecuted)  The thugs that shot John Crawford, while he carried a BB-gun he was about to buy, will not be prosecuted.  The US legal system, through a combination of its official rules and its unstated prejudices, empowers thugs to shoot innocent black men from time to time, and to harass them continually.  26 September 2014 (Israeli crime)  Kidnaping and killing three Israeli teenagers was a horrible crime, by every day standards, but Israel used it as an excuse to commit a crime 400 times as big.  26 September 2014 (Privacy research)  Google gave money to Stanford for research, but made Stanford accept the condition not to use it to fund privacy research.  [later] It seems the original report was based on a misunderstanding; everyone now says there was no such restriction.  26 September 2014 (Marine reserves in the Pacific)  The US and Kiribati will create vast marine reserves in the Pacific.  25 September 2014 (Protesters block UK coal train)  Greenpeace protesters in the UK blocked a coal train and packed the coal into bags saying to return it to Putin.  25 September 2014 (Mass protest in Tokyo)  A mass protest in Tokyo against restarting nuclear power plants.  25 September 2014 ("Plagiarism" of policy proposals)  Two Republican legislators criticized a Democratic candidate for "plagiarizing" part of the text of a policy proposal. The same two Republicans did not hesitate to copy a nasty ALEC model bill and present it as their own work.  The concept of plagiarism is not applicable to policy proposals and laws. It would be total folly to refrain from advocating a good policy just because someone else has advocated it before.  25 September 2014 (Science and political issues)  Scientists must resist the idea that science is above politics and that they ought to be apolitical.  Today, several areas of science tie directly to the most important political issues of our age, including global heating, privacy, and toxic agricultural practices.  25 September 2014 (Attempt to hold torturers responsible)  Trying again to hold British soldiers in the Bush forces responsible for torture carried out in cahoots with the US government.  25 September 2014 (Metaphors and global heating)  Taking metaphors seriously is no way to understand an important issue such as global heating.  25 September 2014 (Fines issued by thug in rage)  A thug in Seattle expressed his hostility to another official by giving 80 people fines for smoking marijuana, apparently illegally.  25 September 2014 (China promises cap on greenhouse gas)  China pledged to publish soon a schedule for capping and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  If China goes through with this, the US had better do it too.  Most of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the US, and India.  25 September 2014 (Tasmania's proposed anti-protest laws)  Tasmania's proposed law, meant to crush protests against logging, will exclude places such as stores and public areas. But it will still be aimed at forests, factories, and farms, so it is still unacceptable.  25 September 2014 (Australia's plans for asylum seekers)  Australia is trying to make asylum seekers go to Papua New Guinea, including some who are gay &mdash; but they would be persecuted there.  It plans to force them to Cambodia instead.  25 September 2014 (Turkey to fight ISIS)  Turkey will participate in fighting ISIS.  This support is clearly useful, but even though Turkey's government is not as bad as Saudi Arabia's or Bahrain's or Qatar's, it is still Islamist and an enemy of human rights.  25 September 2014 (Duck Duck Go gains prestige)  China awarded Duck Duck Go its most prestigious internet medal: censorship.  25 September 2014 (UK children retarded by poverty)  Plutocrat-imposed poverty in the UK shows up in children: half the children of the age to start school are not mentally developed enough. Their parents are too short of money to do what the children need.  The Tory Party has condemned those children to a life of backwardness, but Labour says it will make only marginal improvements.  25 September 2014 (Right-wing donations laundered)  Dinesh D'Souza confessed to laundering donations for right-wing political campaigns.  25 September 2014 (US airstrikes in Raqqa)  Interviews with civilians in Raqqa about the US airstrikes there.  25 September 2014 (Spain's right-wing gov't)  Spain's right-wing government has given up on attacking abortion rights.  However, it has already made a large fraction of Spaniards poor, and attacked the right to protest.  25 September 2014 (Unemployment in Italy)  An Italian town's last-ditch effort to help the unemployed people is to give some of them funds to try to emigrate.  24 September 2014 (Israeli soldiers kill suspects)  Israeli soldiers found the two Palestinians that were suspected of kidnaping and murdering three Israeli teenagers, and killed them.  Why weren't they arrested instead? Maybe they fought and made it impossible to arrest them. Or maybe the Israelis preferred to kill them.  24 September 2014 (US allied with vicious regimes)  The US is now allied with Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, in fighting in Syria.  It makes strategic sense to ally with Sunni monarchies to undermine the claims of ISIS to the loyalty of Sunnis. But I can't understand how anyone can be "proud to stand shoulder to shoulder" with these vicious regimes. Saudi Arabia beheads people regularly, and oppresses women almost as badly as ISIS does. As for Bahrain, remember the protests and the massacres?  24 September 2014 (Google breaks with ALEC)  Google has broken with ALEC.  Being willing to work with ALEC even over some other issue suggests a moral blindness.  24 September 2014 (US air strikes against ISIS)  The US started air strikes against ISIS in Syria, including in the city of Raqaa, with cooperation from Jordan.  An announcement on CNN said, "A military official said the strikes are meant to target the ability of the terror group to command and control, resupply and train." There is nothing wrong with those goals in principle, but this means the attacks are not against troops in the field &mdash; and therefore are likely to kill civilians.  If the people living in Raqaa resent ISIS and wish they could kick ISIS out, they will welcome these attacks; if some of them are killed, they will consider that a necessary evil and blame ISIS. But if they don't resent ISIS, they will blame the US for those deaths, and give ISIS more support.  24 September 2014 (The "tax inversion" loophole)  Obama says administrative measures will close the "tax inversion" loophole.  It will be good to shut it this way, but that ought to be firmed up in law.  24 September 2014 (The spying-industrial complex)  The spying-industrial complex: 5 companies that get contracts from US intelligence agencies and continually exaggerate the danger of terrorism.  Terrorists do exist, but the threat they pose to Americans is minute compared with the danger of cars, smoking, and the plutocratic regime that leaves tens of millions of Americans with no health care except the emergency room.  Terrorism hype is striking Australia too, and being used as the excuse to attack civil liberties there.  24 September 2014 (Harassment of US journalists)  The Committee to Protect Journalists rebuked the Obama regime again for its harassment and prosecution of journalists.  24 September 2014 (400,000 people march in NYC)  400,000 people joined in the climate march in New York City.  This was followed by the Flood Wall Street protest. The protesters couldn't get inside the stock exchanges, but pointed out that the ocean will get in, unless we stop the global heating that raises sea level.  24 September 2014 (Private US college tuition)  Private US colleges are demanding more money from poor families while offering scholarships to the wealthy.  24 September 2014 (Hong Kong students protest)  Hong Kong students have called a week of strikes to demand democratic elections.  24 September 2014 (Australia cutting intel budget)  Australia has been cutting the budget for intelligence agencies. Proposed attacks on human rights are apparently meant to compensate for that.  23 September 2014 (Effects of global heating on the poor)  Coping with the effects of global heating is leaving some poor countries short of funds for health care and education.  23 September 2014 (Employment)  Extending unemployment benefits has no effect on when or whether people get back to work. But it sure helps them avoid living in the street unless/until they get work again.  What does help get people work is government spending directed in ways that create a lot of jobs &mdash; not spending on banks or weapons. For instance, unemployment benefits feed money into the economy, and the recipients are sure to spend it right away on job-creating activities.  Almost 40% of potentially employed people in the US are not working, because there aren't jobs for them. Most of them are in some degree of hardship. Automation is likely to make this a lot worse.  The solution is a basic income for everyone.  24 September 2014 (Courageous Australian MP)  A courageous Australian MP calls for former prime minister Howard to be prosecuted by the ICC for starting a war based on lies.  Hear, hear!  24 September 2014 (Ban on Fracking)  The Urgent Case for a Ban on Fracking.  24 September 2014 (Republicans blocking voter registrations)  Republicans in Georgia are blocking 51,000 voter registrations, apparently because they are from minority groups.  24 September 2014 ("Preventative detention")  Australia has ordered some sort of "preventative detention" for people associated in some way with an alleged terror plot. Everyone is forbidden to publish any information about what is going on, including (it appears) the names of the people imprisoned.  Are those people's friends talking about their absence?  24 September 2014 (UK may sneak secretly into a ground war in Iraq)  The UK may sneak secretly into a ground war in Iraq using commando groups, while imposing new secrecy rules to thwart democracy.  24 September 2014 (Global economy needs to cut its carbon intensity)  The global economy needs to cut its carbon intensity by 6% per year from now till 2100 to avoid more than 2 degrees of heating.  And that's assuming good luck, that we don't hit an unexpected positive feedback that sends heating shooting ahead.  24 September 2014 (Exports of fossil fuels and uranium)  Australia's government plans to increase exports of fossil fuels and uranium, effectively aiming to push the rest of the world to cause global heating disaster.  24 September 2014 (Western Australia killed an aboriginal woman)  Western Australia killed an aboriginal woman by jailing her for unpaid parking tickets and denying her medical care.  24 September 2014 (Queensland returning land to aboriginal traditional owners)  Queensland is returning 20,000 square km of land to aboriginal traditional owners.  Europeans took the land of Australia from the aboriginal peoples, and it is right to give some of it back.  However, I do not approve of the aboriginal culture's idea that major aspects of that culture, its laws in effect, should be the property of small groups. Secret law is not law. It does far more harm in Obama's hands, or the Australian government's hands, than in the aboriginal people's hands, because the latter have comparatively little power. It is wrong in principle nonetheless.  24 September 2014 (Single mothers occupied boarded-up building)  29 single mothers, made homeless by the UK's crush-the-poor policies and threatened with being sent 200 miles away, have occupied a boarded-up building in their town.  24 September 2014 (Life in prison for publishing political views)  China sentenced Ilham Tohti to life in prison for publishing political views.  The US is not in a position to sneer at China, given what it continues to do in Guantanamo.  24 September 2014 (ISIS released video)  ISIS released a video calling on supporters to kill non-Muslims in Australia, Canada, Europe and the US.  It is a valid point that this video shows ISIS does not have the power to carry out such attacks itself.  A more important point becomes visible when we consider why ISIS made this statement. They can't help knowing that it will inflame war-fever in those countries, so that must be their aim. They must want those countries to engage in an overt war that will boost support for ISIS among the people it rules. They are telling us, enemies they can barely touch, to "come out and fight like a man" so they can profit from that mistake.  One Australian politician questions the logic of trying to destroy ISIS by war. "We must curb our instinctive reaction and look at the root causes."  Jordan's participation in the attack on ISIS in Syria was a good move for Obama, since it will undermine ISIS's message to Sunnis.  23 September 2014 (Home of the brave)  The thug who accosted Danielle Watts had no legal basis to do so, and he handcuffed for calmly exercising the legal rights everyone is supposed to have in the US.  Three cheers for Danielle Watts!  23 September 2014 (Walmart dumps cost of uniforms on workers)  Walmart is dumping the cost of new uniforms on its workers by calling the uniforms a "dress code".  23 September 2014 (Thug tases teenage driver)  A thug tased a teenage driver, apparently because the car's electric window on the passenger side did not open. Dragged out of the car, the driver's head seems to have hit the ground, causing a grave brain injury.  This is unremarkable in the US, but this teenager was not a mere citizen. He was the son of another thug. So shit is hitting the fan.  I hope that kid gets justice, but it won't be a lot of justice if it applies only when the victim is the child of a thug.  23 September 2014 (After Scotland's vote)  After Scotland almost voted to exit the UK, will that be enough to convert the timid Labour Party into something ready to fix what is wrong?  23 September 2014 (Rockefellers to divest from fossil fuel)  The Rockefeller Brothers Fund pledged to divest from fossil fuel.  In addition to punishing fossil fuel companies' stock price &mdash; which could be cancelled out if other investors buy in &mdash; the divestment movement can concentrate plutocratic lobbying power in favor of decarbonization. Plutocratic lobbying power is an injustice, and to restore democracy we must get rid of it, but in the mean time setting some of it against global heating is a step forward.  23 September 2014 (Surrendering France to plutocrats)  The French government, under the Socialist Party, plans to make France "more competitive". That's the code word for "surrender to the plutocrats."  23 September 2014 (Militarization of US thugs)  The Pentagon gives military weapons even to thug departments that the US government considers likely to violate people's rights. It is a mistake to suppose that the other thug departments won't do this. Hardly any of them should get military weapons.  The existence of a SWAT team impels rules to use it frequently, and that use puts people's lives in danger. The US needs 20 SWAT teams in cities distributed around the country; more than that is an avoidable risk.  23 September 2014 (Bearers of economic risks)  Why Ordinary People Bear Economic Risks and Donald Trump Doesn't.  23 September 2014 (India's attack against Greenpeace)  India denied entry to a Greenpeace official, as part of a broad attack against Greenpeace.  The Modi government is turning out to be an even greater sellout to business than the Congress Party was.  23 September 2014 (Evidence that Darrien Hunt was cosplaying)  There is evidence suggesting Darrien Hunt was cosplaying when thugs shot him.  23 September 2014 (Ocean acidification)  Human CO2 emissions, by acidifying the oceans, are reducing the ocean's ability to absorb CO2. This means more of the emissions will go into the atmosphere and global heating will speed up.  23 September 2014 (Sports teams bully US cities)  Arrogant sports teams bully US cities into funding stadiums for them, promising the cities economic growth &mdash; which benefits only a few, if it happens at all.  23 September 2014 (Futon Physics)  A humorous article, Futon Physics  22 September 2014 (Italian Puns)  New puns in Italian   22 September 2014 (Right of first sale)  Congress is considering a bill to allow resale of devices that contain software covered by EULAs.  This is a first step in the right direction. The right of first sale should trump all EULAs, and so should personal modification.  The article refers to DRM (digital restrictions management) by the unfortunate term "digital locks". This grants them legitimacy by comparing them to ordinary locks. Please criticize that term when you see it.  22 September 2014 (March for the Climate)  While We March for the Climate, Governments Meet with Polluters.  22 September 2014 (Uber drivers getting shafted)  Uber drivers are getting shafted; Uber can arbitrarily cut their pay, and they have to work 15 hours a day. Some are trying to unionize.  Uber requires running nonfree software, too; if you value your freedom, you won't consider Uber an option.  We should not accept the whitewash label of "sharing economy" for companies like Uber. A more accurate term is "piecework subcontractor economy".  22 September 2014 (University divestment from fossil fuels)  The University of Dayton has decided to divest from fossil fuels and invest some of those funds in green energy.  22 September 2014 (Folly of school "lockdown" drills)  The folly of repeated "lockdown" drills in US schools.  22 September 2014 (Thousands protested in Moscow)  Thousands protested in Moscow against aggression in Ukraine.  22 September 2014 (Only in US would people propose this law)  Only in the US would people propose a law to punish parents simply because their teenage children commit crimes.  22 September 2014 (Failing completely to reduce CO2 emissions)  Humanity is failing completely to reduce CO2 emissions; they are headed for a record this year.  22 September 2014 (Afghanistan was unable to conclude an election)  Afghanistan was unable to conclude an election to choose between two candidates for president, so eventually the two leading candidates made a power-sharing deal.  It does not betoken a government with sufficient unity and strength to fight the Taliban.  22 September 2014 (Fighting fossil fuels)  Desmond Tutu calls for fighting fossil fuels with the tactics used to fight apartheid, including boycotting anything sponsored by fossil fuel companies.  22 September 2014 (Secret prison in Afghanistan)  The US handed over some Pakistani prisoners from its secret prison in Afghanistan to prison in Pakistan.  This Bagram prison is even nastier than Guantanamo; the prisoners have been brought there from around the world, can't even see a lawyer, and the US won't even say who is imprisoned there. In effect, they have been disappeared.  No matter what those men did, or are accused (perhaps spuriously) of doing, it can't justify this.  22 September 2014 (A wave of assassinations)  Libyan Islamists appear to be behind a wave of assassinations of non-Islamists in Benghazi.  21 September 2014 (Ebola virus)  In the horrible world where Ebola virus spreads, anyone who comes near you could kill you.  If we stop the spread of Ebola reasonably soon, the long-term population growth will be unaffected. Having "neighbourhood festivities" when a baby is born might be partly responsible for the dangerously high growth rate. We need to do something about that.  21 September 2014 (The "privatization" of Britain)  How the "privatization" of Britain replaced government services with foreign-controlled monopolies.  21 September 2014 (Poor people can barely cope)  Why poor people eat junk food and smoke, and can't make long-term plans that would improve their circumstances: they can barely cope with each week.  Being sleepy all the time makes it harder for people to plan well. When the system imposes that on people, it's the system that must be changed. However, discouragement plays a role too. It is hard to summon up attention for long-term dangers when you know you can't protect yourself from the immediate dangers.  This shows that the US needs to undo the plutocratic changes since 1980, so as to make most people's lives no worse than they were then.  However, it also shows the importance of helping the poor in ways that don't require them to make plans, choose carefully among options, and apply for support. Because they don't have the time for that on top of their daily obligations.  When a woman who did not want to get pregnant has an abortion, it means the system failed to give her the means to avoid pregnancy and she is correcting that failure.  We should help poor women avoid pregnancy by having high school steer students into effective modern birth control, such as implants or IUDs. The state should pay for these, for all women. To refuse is stupid penny-pinching.  If you want to buy Ms Tirado's book, please don't order it, especially not from Amazon. Buy it with anonymous cash in a local independent book store.  21 September 2014 (Fingerprinting students)  UK schools have taken the fingerprints of a million students as if it were nothing.  21 September 2014 (Google)  Assange: Google is effectively the private equivalent of the NSA.  21 September 2014 (Global heating denial)  Global heating's effects are all around us, but powerful plutocrats suppress recognition of global heating in the US (and Canada, Australia and the UK). So US cities that want to plan to cope with the consequences expected in the next few decades have to tiptoe around the cause.  21 September 2014 (US massive surveillance programs)  The CDT and ACLU reported 5 US massive surveillance programs to the UN as especially threatening to human rights.  21 September 2014 (Paranoia in Australia)  Paranoia in Australia: a passenger was kicked off a flight because someone saw him scribbling in a notebook about the fear of terrorism.  This sort of paranoia helps governments attack human rights, which does far more damage than terrorists ever could.  21 September 2014 (Obama to "forward-deploy" some "advisers")  Obama says he won't send ground troops to fight in Iraq, but instead will "forward-deploy" some of the "advisers". In practice, it may be the same thing.  There may be some advantage in this disguise; until ISIS kills some on the battlefield, the US could claim not to have troops fighting in Iraq, much as Putin pretended not to have Russian troops fighting in Ukraine.  21 September 2014 (US thugs waiting to rob Canadians)  Warning to Canadians: in the US, thugs are waiting to rob you.  21 September 2014 (Artificial sweeteners)  A study gives a preliminary suggestion that common artificial sweeteners can affect intestinal bacteria in some people, causing them to experience high blood sugar levels.  21 September 2014 (Antibiotic resistance)  The proposed US law to prevent antibiotic resistance won't help; it will make the system worse.  21 September 2014 (Wars of Choice)  Ralph Nader: Damaging Our Country from Wars of Choice.  21 September 2014 (US news editors rebuke Obama)  Leading US news editors rebuked Obama for making the US government more secretive and for intimidation of journalists.  21 September 2014 (The poor to bear global heating cost)  Rich countries including the US are going back on their promises to help poor countries cope with the damages of global heating.  It was inevitable that, as those increased, the rich countries would someday face so much expense coping with those increasing damages that they would refuse to help other countries. Eventually the rich countries themselves will be unable to cope.  However, the austerity that the plutocrats have imposed on the US has made it happen sooner.  21 September 2014 (Less CO2 emissions from Australia)  Australia is drifting into less CO2 emissions, which is good, but means it should adopt a more ambitious target.  21 September 2014 (New Zealand voters reelect spying liars)  New Zealand voters reelected the rulers that spy on them all and lied about it.  One might be tempted to say that they deserve such mistreatment, but that is fallacious. Only half of them chose it &mdash; but all are now stuck with it.  21 September 2014 (Nadya ToloKonnikova)  Nadya Tolokonnikova continues working in Russia to oppose Putin's regime, and global capitalism on the side.  I don't oppose capitalism as such &mdash; the existence of private businesses. However, what some call "global capitalism" is more plutocracy than capitalism as such, and I oppose plutocracy.  21 September 2014 (Peanut contamination hidden)  Executives of a US peanut plant have been sentenced to prison for falsifying contamination test records. 9 people died from the contamination that they hid this way.  21 September 2014 (New Pun: Fossil Fuels)  New pun: Fossil Fuels.  21 September 2014 (Record-breaking fires in California)  California has had the driest three years ever recorded, causing record-breaking fires, and it's expected to get worse in the coming months.  The fire season in the US west has increased, typically, by 70 days since a few decades ago. That is long-term change, global heating at work.  The fires convert trees into carbon dioxide, adding to global heating. Positive feedbacks like this mean that at some point (which we can't predict) global heating will become self-perpetuating.  The fools running the University of California refused to divest from fossil fool companies.  They think divestment would cut the income for running the university. That's probably true, for the next few years at least. They'd certainly be better off continuing the status quo &mdash; but they are fools to think that is what they have chosen.  Have they thought about how much funds the University of California will lose when global heating wrecks the state economy? When drought eliminates half the farming in California, and the forests are burning up, do they think the state will prioritize the university over firefighters? If global heating continues unchecked, some sort of University of California may still exist in 30 years, but it will be a shadow of its present-day self.  If the regents were wiser, they would grab at any chance to avoid that fate. Divestment at least offers a chance.  This is much worse than rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. They are on the oil train, rolling slowly torwards Lac-M&eacute;gantic, and trying to save money by not putting on the brakes.  21 September 2014 (Wisconsin voter ID law)  Republican judges authorized Wisconsin's voter ID law less than two months before the election. 300,000 voters may be disenfranchised, and it would be very hard for them to get IDs even if they can afford to try.  Republicans impose voter ID laws because most citizens that don't have IDs are among the weak who are likely to vote Democrat.  21 September 2014 (London thugs beat helpless man)  The London thug department apologized to Nordell Edmonson. A gang of thugs pulled him out of his car and hit him with sticks while he was helpless &mdash; supposedly because he was driving without insurance.  If he was indeed driving without insurance &mdash; I would not take the thugs word for it &mdash; he deserved to be tried, not beat up.  Edmonson is not satisfied with payment of compensation, because that helps him only. He wants action to curb the violence of the thugs.  21 September 2014 (Australian "anti-terrorism" law)  The proposed Australian "anti-terrorism" law would permit torture.  This law is clearly unnecessary; an alleged terrorist plot involving real violence was watched and the planners were arrested yesterday.  21 September 2014 (Putin to set up internet disconnect switch)  Putin has plans to set up means to disconnect the Russian internet from the rest of the world in an "emergency".  "Emergency" in this case means Russians' paying attention to criticism of Putin.  21 September 2014 (NSA part of blackmail system)  Since the NSA hands over data about Palestinian-Americans' communications to Israel, and Israel uses such data to blackmail Palestinians in Palestine, it looks like the NSA is part of the blackmail system.  20 September 2014 (Transportation of oil)  Canada's extraction lobbyist hopes that more disasters with oil trains will convince the US to approve Keystone XL.  However, looking at the harm done by extracting it as well as by burning it the best option is to stop transporting that oil in any way.  20 September 2014 (Rebuking abuses of power in China)  Ilham Tohti is about to be convicted of bogus charges after a phony trial. His unpardonable crime was to rebuke abuses of power rather than advocate Uighur nationalism.  20 September 2014 (Abandoned oil wells)  Pennsylvania has 200,000 abandoned oil wells, and when fracking is done near them, they become channels for leaking methane.  21 September 2014 (Mexican soldiers captured and then summarily shot 22 people)  Mexican soldiers captured and then summarily shot 22 people, including members of a drug gang, and others who said they had been kidnaped by the gang.  21 September 2014 (Egypt's regime has made religion an arm of the state)  Egypt's regime has made religion an arm of the state. Atheists have been threatened with arrest.  21 September 2014 (NFL player charged with violence against a woman)  Yet another NFL football player is charged with violence against a woman: he appears have tried to force his wife to have sex, then hit her and broke her nose. This together with manipulative threats.  21 September 2014 (The world's population)  Decrease of the human population growth rate has ceased in sub-Saharan Africa. The world's population threatens to grow to 11 billion by 2100.  I don't think it can reach that level &mdash; the consequences will cause global disaster before then, and many children will die. But that is a horrible way to limit the population.  21 September 2014 (Microbeads in toothpaste)  Microbeads in toothpaste can hurt users' gums, as well as wildlife after they go down the drain.  21 September 2014 (Forced to Collect Human Waste by Hand)  India's "Untouchables" Are Still Being Forced to Collect Human Waste by Hand.  There are two wrongs here: the fact that many Indians don't have flushing toilets (which is a matter of poverty and overpopulation) and the fact that certain people are forced to clean them. If caste prejudice were eliminated, the second wrong would be gone but the first wrong would remain.  21 September 2014 (License plate cameras)  A California court denied a driver's suit to gain access to the data that license plate cameras have collected about him.  We should not allow license plate cameras to record seeing any particular plate, unless that plate is invalid or sought by court order.  21 September 2014 (Enslavement of high tech workers in Malaysia)  More about enslavement of high tech workers in Malaysia, and suggestions for ending it.  21 September 2014 (Vote counting for Scotland's referendum)  Russian observers say that the vote counting for Scotland's referendum on independence was not done in accord with international norms.  This is a cheap shot &mdash; the Scottish referendum should have been run according to standards, but that does not validate Putin's phony elections in the Crimea or in Russia.  21 September 2014 (Mother Jailed for Sending Semi-Naked Photos of Daughters)  Mother Jailed for Sending Semi-Naked Photos of Daughters to Dance Teacher.  It appears that the dance teacher manipulated her into doing this so that her daughters would be admitted or kept in the dance school. He abused his power, but I don't think she should be punished.  21 September 2014 (The West Is Acting on Ebola)  Finally, The West Is Acting on Ebola. What Took Us So Long?  21 September 2014 (Atheist airman)  The US Air Force allowed an Atheist airman to swear his oath to support the Constitution without citing a deity.  20 September 2014 (Torture by Nigerian thugs)  Torture is standard practice for Nigerian thugs.  20 September 2014 (Fire near Sacramento)  A fire near Sacramento has burned over 110 square miles and is threatening 2000 houses.  Since global heating is making California more arid, this will be a frequent occurrence in a couple of decades.  20 September 2014 (Agent Orange-resistant GMO crops)  The USDA approved GMO corn and soybeans resistant to the herbicide 2,4-D, which was used in Agent Orange during the Vietnam war.  Superweeds will experience a temporary setback, but in a few years they will evolve resistance to this chemical too.  20 September 2014 (Paying to prevent discussions)  Many companies give money to political parties to prevent an issue from ever being discussed.  20 September 2014 (For-profit schools)  A US for-profit college company has been sued for predatory lending.  I think it is a good idea to prohibit for-profit schools, and for-profit hospitals too.  Philanthropists are buying the students' loans in order to forgive them.  This is necessary because the US has made it impossible to get rid of student loans through bankruptcy. That law is cruel.  20 September 2014 (Obama's "free trade" proposals)  Obama continues to propose to boost exports with antidemocratic "free trade" treaties. The existing ones have not had that effect, but the US Trade Representative is giving Congress fudged statistics to pretend that they did.  Even if they did boost exports, it would not be particularly good, because that principally means more profit for US businesses. Nowadays that growth does little good for US workers, due to the antidemocratic effects of these same treaties. So there is no reason for Americans to make increased exports a goal at all.  20 September 2014 (Pay toilets)  How pay toilets were eliminated in the US.  I wish other countries would pass similar laws.  20 September 2014 (Assad may help US target bombing of ISIS)  Reports say that Assad has agreed to US bombing of ISIS forces in Syria.  If Assad does indeed help target the attacks, that would be useful since they would be less likely to hit the wrong targets. But I worry about one thing: would Assad dishonestly supply coordinates of non-ISIS rebels, claiming they were ISIS?  20 September 2014 (Japan's "scientific" whaling)  Japan's "scientific" whaling has produced just two peer-reviewed papers since 2005.  The papers were based on 9 out of the 3600 minke whales Japan has killed during that time.  20 September 2014 (US citizen reports from Yemen prison)  Sharif Mobley found a way to phone his wife and told her he was being tortured in Yemen's prison.  It appears that the Obama regime and Yemen's regime are collaborating to imprison him without trial. He faces criminal charges, perhaps bogus, but the Yemen regime is sabotaging the trial by refusing to bring him to court.  20 September 2014 (Estate tax)  Senator Sanders proposes a law to make rich heirs start paying estate tax again.  20 September 2014 (Japan to disregard vote on whaling)  Japan announced it will disregard the International Whaling Commission's vote to limit whaling in the Southern Ocean.  20 September 2014 (Price on carbon emissions)  Big investment groups called for a "stable, reliable and economically meaningful" price on carbon emissions.  20 September 2014 (Metadata)  What can be learned about Ton Siedsma from one week of his metadata? Quite a lot.  20 September 2014 (Playing while black)  Darrien Hunts' sword had a rounded edge, so he could hardly have seriously threatened anyone with it. It appears that, before the thugs shot him, he was making moves with the sword as a form of pretend play, away from other people.  The most dangerous looking thing about him was his skin color. If you're a black male, in the US, people will often perceive your actions as dangerous; if a while male did the same thing, people would not consider it dangerous. Over and over, this leads thugs to kill innocent people.  20 September 2014 (Enslaved Malaysian workers)  A large fraction of the workers in Malaysia's electronics factories are enslaved.  20 September 2014 (Being lured into war by videos)  The head of the Lib Dems says he won't let the UK be lured into war with ISIS by provocative videos. There are surely some US politicians that are wise enough to reject that, but the mainstream media don't present them much.  19 September 2014 (The silence on global heating)  The Silence on Climate Change Is Deafening. It's Time for Us to Get Loud.  The term "climate change" was coined by the denialist movement to make global heating sound neutral rather than dangerous. It makes no sense for us to use that term.  19 September 2014 (Price of meeting UK ministers)  The Tories have been so successful at enriching UK businesses that they have doubled the price of meeting ministers.  19 September 2014 (Canadian PM to skip climate summit)  Canadian PM Harper will skip the climate summit.  Not surprising, for a government that gags scientists to cover up the unpleasant facts of global heating.  19 September 2014 (US criticism undermined)  US criticism of Putin's expansionism and destabilization is undermined by several instances where the US did or supported similar actions.  19 September 2014 (US universities militarizing thugs)  US universities are getting M-16 assault rifles, even grenade launchers, for their campus thugs. It is dangerous for them to have such weapons.  18 September 2014 (Urgent: Statement of support for Greenpeace protesters)  US citizens: sign a statement of support for Greenpeace protesters in Cincinnati, who face ten years' imprisonment under Putinesque charges.  18 September 2014 (Urgent: Cleanup of pipeline spill)  US citizens: Tell House Energy Chair Upton to give the polluters' campaign money to the cleanup of the pipeline spill in his district.  19 September 2014 (ISIS threatening to attack the White House)  ISIS released another provocative video, this one threatening to attack the White House.  The ISIS propaganda team is clever, and surely expects this to make a lot of US politicians demand war so that they can look tough. I continue to claim that ISIS wants the US to fight so that it can convince Iraqi Sunnis that they have no choice but to support ISIS.  18 September 2014 (Urgent: Powerplant carbon limits)  US citizens: call on the EPA to make powerplant carbon limits strong enough to do the job.  18 September 2014 (Thugs attacked a BBC team in Moscow)  A group of thugs (not necessarily official state thugs) attacked a BBC team in Moscow; while the team was reporting the attack to the official thugs, someone erased their computers' memories.  Apparently some of Putin's men wanted to stop them from reporting on a Russian soldier apparently killed in Ukraine.  18 September 2014 (Russian writer Mikhail Shishkin)  Russian writer Mikhail Shishkin says that Putin has taken Russia back to "Soviet times of total lies", and that Putin's violence is preparing Russians to support a series of wars.  Putin's nationalist propaganda resembles the US propaganda used to convince Americans to have faith that the US is the "good guy" in every war, in disregard of all truth. However, Putin's version is even stronger.  Here's more about Mikhail Shishkin.  I am saddened by the Americans that grasp at straws to argue that Putin's lies are truth and that the fault lies entirely with Kiev.  There certainly is some wrong on Kiev's side. Its deal with the EU could pave the way for "shock capitalism" and disastrous debt. There are indeed neo-nazi militias fighting for Kiev.  Kiev's rejection of easterners' demands for limited autonomy was unjustified. But none of this alters the nature of Putin's military aggression in Ukraine.  18 September 2014 (Pakistani professor assassinated)  A Pakistani professor who promoted a liberal interpretation of Islam's social rules was assassinated.  18 September 2014 (Battle over cutting Tasmania's old-growth forests)  The battle over cutting Tasmania's old-growth forests will resume, with a government ban on protests condemned by the UN.  18 September 2014 (Chevron trying to buy city council election)  Chevron is trying to buy the city council election in Richmond, California using smears and confusion.  18 September 2014 (Sucking the US into war)  Many experts warn that ISIS propaganda videos are intended to suck the US into a war that would legitimize ISIS among Sunnis and thus strengthen it.  US hawks that call for immediate war are motivated by domestic politics. If as a byproduct of political gain they strengthen ISIS, that's not important to them.  18 September 2014 (Cutting poverty)  What the US government must do if it wants to cut poverty.  18 September 2014 (Posting negative reviews about businesses)  California passed a bill banning businesses from making customers agree not to post negative reviews. One is proposed at the US level.  I wonder whether these measures also cover the attempt to require customers to assign copyright on their reviews to the business.  18 September 2014 (Nationalism)  As surrender to plutocracy spreads poverty across Europe, nationalism offers the prospect of a magical escape without confronting the real root of the injustice.  Often nationalism puts the blame for poverty on "parasitic" immigrants rather the principal parasites &mdash; the rich.  18 September 2014 (FinFisher)  The German government allowed the intrusion software FinFisher to be sold to governments that trample human rights.  The article errs in talking about "Linux computers"; the context shows that this refers to the GNU/Linux system.  18 September 2014 (Hottest August ever recorded)  August 2014 was the hottest August ever recorded, just like May and June.  18 September 2014 (China torturing professor)  Professor Ilham Tohti, who wrote in favor of Uighurs' rights, is being tortured as preparation for his show trial.  18 September 2014 (Global heating denial for kids)  Texas is trying to rewrite textbooks to deny global heating.  18 September 2014 (Limited autonomy in Eastern Ukraine)  Ukraine's government has adopted partial autonomy for the Eastern region where the rebellion is occurring.  This limited autonomy seems natural to me, given that every part of the United States has it. Did Ukraine offer this limited autonomy at the beginning?  18 September 2014 (Apples unjust power over users)  Lots of iThing users are complaining that they did not want the U2 album "gift" that Apple stuck them with &mdash; and that it was hard to delete.  These complaints focus on a superficial problem, which reflects the shallow thinking that Apple instills in its users. Ironically, though, this superficial problem reflects a much deeper problem that the complainers have failed to notice: the unjust power that Apple has imposed on whoever uses an iThing or iTunes.  18 September 2014 (TSA gropes passenger after flight)  Agents of the Theater of Security Agency demanded to grope a passenger after he got off a flight, claiming it was because they had forgotten to do this before the flight.  18 September 2014 (Resource distribution for voting places)  Some US states provide fewer resources to voting places with more minority groups, causing long waiting lines.  One must suspect this is another method of Republican voter suppression.  18 September 2014 (New Mexico sheriff faces charges)  A New Mexico sheriff faces charges for two cases of attacking passing drivers.  18 September 2014 (Mass surveillance in New Zealand)  New Zealand Prime Minister Key is changing and contradicting his statements to try to deny revelations about the massive surveillance he started.  18 September 2014 (US gov't still trying to smear Snowden)  The US government continues trying to smear Snowden with falsified claims that his disclosures aided terrorists.  Even if they had been of some use to underground enemies of Americans, that harm would be small compared with the positive contribution of giving us a chance to recover democracy.  18 September 2014 (Cost of sea level rise)  Sea level rise could cause over 200 billion dollars in damages to buildings and infrastructure in Australia in this century.  For the US, I would guess it is ten times that. Has anyone seen a recent estimate?  18 September 2014 (Man shot in the back by thugs)  Thugs said they shot Darrien Hunt because he lunged at them with a sword. However, an autopsy found he was shot in the back.  Surveillance camera recordings have been provided to the thugs but not to Hunt's family.  18 September 2014 (Racism among US thugs)  Attorney General Holder launched a study of racism among US thugs.  It is a good idea. If only he went after the banksters and the torturers, he'd be doing a good job.  18 September 2014 (Persecution of Botswana journalists)  The president of Botswana is persecuting journalists that reported on his car accident.  18 September 2014 (Prisoner granted euthanasia)  Belgium has granted a prisoner's petition for euthanasia.  I understand and sympathize with a prisoner's wish to die rather than spend life in prison.  It worries me that there's a danger this will encourage prison conditions designed to encourage suicide, a de-facto death penalty. However, such conditions exist in many countries, including the US, where euthanasia is not allowed.  18 September 2014 (New pollution controls cut Australian coal)  New Chinese pollution controls on coal will cut into Australian coal exports.  This is a great opportunity for Australia to cancel all the planned expansions in coal mining.  18 September 2014 (Imprisonment of Ghoncheh Ghavami)  Ghoncheh Ghavami has been imprisoned in Iran for 3 months for asking to be allowed to watch a sporting event alongside men.  18 September 2014 (The Fate of the Gaza Ceasefire)  Noam Chomsky: The Fate of the Gaza Ceasefire.  18 September 2014 (Invasion by Israeli "settlers")  Israeli "settlers" invaded Hebron and pepper-sprayed two Palestinian children, who had to be taken to a hospital.  18 September 2014 (Google's support for ALEC)  Google refuses to respond to public criticism of its support for ALEC.  18 September 2014 (Drug smuggling funds Jihadi groups)  Jihadi groups in north Mali run on funds obtained by smuggling drugs north.  I seem to recall that Islam disapproves of these drugs. It would be hard to reconcile the smuggling with being an "Islamist".  18 September 2014 (Tax rules for multinational companies)  44 economically powerful countries are drawing up a plan to make multinational companies pay taxes.  18 September 2014 (Deal made with Qatar)  Qatar has made a deal to reduce its support for Islamist parties. The deal also includes ordering al-Jazeera to stop criticizing Egypt for its bloody suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood.  I shed no tears for those religious extremists, but al-Jazeera has been hurt by this. We have seen evidence of bias in al-Jazeera imposed from above, but this blatant censorship is shameful nonetheless.  17 September 2014 (Teenagers doing less harmful things)  Teenagers in many countries are drinking less, using drugs less, even getting pregnant less. Perhaps that's because they expect to be punished all their lives if they do those things, and expect the adult world to be one that condemns all but a small fraction winners to hopeless poverty.  It's good that teenagers do less of these harmful things, but not good at all that plutocracy has made adult life so hard.  17 September 2014 (Curbing global heating without harming economic growth)  The New Climate Economy report claims it is possible to curb global heating without harming economic growth.  17 September 2014 (Urgent: Support H.Con.Res.114)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to support H.Con.Res.114, which says that any sustained US combat in Iraq or Syria requires congressional authorization.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  17 September 2014 (Medical marijuana)  An Australian state is moving to legalize medical marijuana but only for people who are dying.  The people who need this most are the ones that might be saved by chemotherapy if they can stand the suffering it causes.  17 September 2014 (Forest fires)  Indonesia has agreed to do more to stop the forest fires that people set for the purpose of deforestation.  Indonesia should make it illegal to farm land that was forest less than 10 years ago, use satellite photos to identify such farms, and destroy them so that the forest can come back.  17 September 2014 (Giganews logging accesses to newsgroups for FBI)  An insider accuses Giganews of logging all accesses to newsgroups for the FBI.  17 September 2014 (US must stop claiming that the law is secret)  To comply with the principles of human rights, the US must stop claiming that the law is secret. Secret "law" is really arbitrary rule.  The "13 Necessary and Proportionate Principles" that the EFF advocates may be necessary and proportionate, but they are not sufficient to achieve their goal: to protect society from massive total surveillance. They were designed for a different context, before Snowden showed us how far surveillance really goes even in "free" countries; then they were transferred to this issue without rethinking them.  What we really need is to redesign digital systems so they don't surveil and track people.  17 September 2014 (Former guard at Auschwitz charged)  A former guard at Auschwitz has been charged as an accessory to 300,000 murders.  It turns out that this guard has campaigned against holocaust deniers.  17 September 2014 (Hagel proposes sending US troops into combat in Iraq)  "Defense" secretary Hagel proposes sending US troops into combat in Iraq to fight an unending war with no concept of victory.  Chelsea Manning &mdash; who was an Iraq intelligence analyst before becoming a heroic whistleblower &mdash; explains why this won't work.  If the goal is to win Iraqi Sunnis away from supporting ISIS, sending US troops to attack them again is the stupidest possible strategy. However, if the goal is to distract Americans with war fervor from the way plutocracy is oppressing them, it might work.  17 September 2014 (Large protests for democracy continue in Hong Kong)  Large protests for democracy continue in Hong Kong after China rejected free elections there.  17 September 2014 (Labeling GMOs)  Look at the companies donating money to oppose the Oregon referendum to require labeling GMOs.  17 September 2014 (Groundwater management)  California has enacted groundwater management.  17 September 2014 (Syria intervention plans)  Senator Machin says he will oppose Obama's misguided Syria intervention plans.  17 September 2014 (Another step towards near-universal poverty)  Web sites that make desperate people bid to do jobs for the lowest pay move society another step towards near-universal poverty.  17 September 2014 (A Diet for a Healthy Planet)  For the First Time, U.S. Agencies Consider a Diet for a Healthy Planet.  17 September 2014 (Israeli war crimes in Gaza)  Human Rights Watch identified several Israeli actions in Gaza that appear to be war crimes and must be investigated.  17 September 2014 (US military to fight Ebola)  Obama will send 3000 US military personnel to Africa to fight Ebola.  I can't judge the details but it seems to be a necessary job.  17 September 2014 (Urgent: Blanket use of antibiotics on farm animals)  US citizens: call on Obama to put a stop to blanket use of antibiotics on farm animals.  17 September 2014 (Tortured to death in an Israeli prison)  An autopsy suggests that a Palestinian prisoner was tortured to death in an Israeli prison.  17 September 2014 (Sacrificing the Vulnerable)  Sacrificing the Vulnerable, From Gaza to America.  17 September 2014 (Urgent: Block another Enbridge pipeline)  US citizens: call on Kerry to block another Enbridge pipeline plan for exporting Canadian tar sands oil.  17 September 2014 (Comcast threatens Tor users)  Users of Comcast are reporting that Comcast says they are not allowed to use Tor and threatening to terminate their service.  17 September 2014 (One-use plastic bags)  California has banned stores from handing out gratis one-use plastic bags.  We need to make bags, and other food packaging, out of plastics that will truly biodegrade in a few years.  I taught myself a couple of years ago to reuse larger, tougher plastic bags. I carry 3 of them in my computer bag and mostly avoid single-use bags.  17 September 2014 ("Democrats" backed by Chamber of Commerce)  The US Chamber of Commerce is backing some "Democrats", the sort who are almost like today's Republicans.  17 September 2014 (Foreign policy lessons learned)  Obama Has Indeed Learned Some Foreign Policy Lessons, Just Not the Ones the Establishment Likes  16 September 2014 (Urgent: Oppose arming Syrian rebels)  US citizens: sign this petition not to arm the Syrian rebels.  16 September 2014 (Urgent: Debate the war against ISIS)  US citizens: call on Congress to debate the war against ISIS.  Call on Obama to seek authorization for this war.  16 September 2014 (FCC receives 3 million comments)  The FCC received 3 million comments about network neutrality.  16 September 2014 (Frack wells contaminate drinking water)  Fracking's contamination of drinking water in Texas and Pennsylvania was due to leaky cement in frack wells, a study finds.  16 September 2014 (An end to rain in part of Brazil)  Deforestation and global heating have put an end to rain in part of Brazil.  16 September 2014 (Librarians campaigning to protect users)  Some librarians are campaigning to protect library users from massive digital surveillance.  16 September 2014 (Press access to Canadian scientist denied)  A newspaper requested an interview with a Canadian scientist about algae. Government officials had a discussion of 100 pages before they refused permission for him to talk to the press.  This is because the facts about the algae demonstrate effects of global heating, while the Canadian government wants to promote use of fossil fuel.  16 September 2014 (Rich French people dodging taxes)  Thousands of rich French people are dodging taxes by moving their money to Belgium.  France needs to tax these people no matter where they go.  16 September 2014 (How LA thugs see black people)  LA thugs saw a black woman kiss a white man in a car, and handcuffed her, making the assumption based on that alone that she was a prostitute. They do this every day, but this time they were embarrassed because she was a film star.  Real prostitutes don't deserve to be treated that way either, so jumping to the conclusion because of her race makes it two wrongs.  16 September 2014 (Biometric ID cards)  Nigeria is imposing biometric ID cards that include fingerprints and iris scans.  And share all the data with Mastercard.  National ID cards such as this are inherently oppressive. Nigeria faces a big terrorist threat, but these  cards will do no good whatsoever against it.  16 September 2014 (Airport expansions in London area)  British politicians distract attention from the need to reduce CO2 emissions by debating where to expand airports in the London area.  At least the estuary airport would be self-limiting, since global heating will eventually make it unserviceable.  16 September 2014 (UK eager to surrender sovereignty)  The UK's right-wing parties talk about recovering sovereignty from the EU, but they are eager to surrender sovereignty to businesses through TTIP (This Treaty Is Plutocratic).  16 September 2014 (Uruguayan marine faces charges in Italy)  An Uruguayan marine who snuck out to Italy when investigated for participation in government torture now faces charges in Italy.  16 September 2014 (Firing people for being gay)  A Republican congresscritter champions the right to fire people for being gay.  16 September 2014 (Urgent: UN control of fuel rod removal)  Everyone: sign this petition for the UN to take control of the removal of fuel rods from the fuel pool at Fukushima #4.  16 September 2014 (Whaling)  Scientists Don't Need to Kill Whales to Study Them.  16 September 2014 (Plastic in the sea)  Sea animals near Australia are eating plastic, 3/4 of which comes from waste from cities.  16 September 2014 (Israeli military intelligence)  The Israeli military intelligence reservists who revealed that their work included blackmailing innocent Palestinians have been condemned for puncturing the claim that Israel's army is "the most moral in the world".  Those reservists believe their army is really supposed to be the world's most moral. That's why they are disgusted with what it really is.  16 September 2014 (Militarization of thug forces)  Militarization of thug forces implies that they are  occupying enemy territory, but who in the US is the enemy? Blacks, principally. This article makes the connection between militarization and racism.  The article also explains that the occupation of Ferguson puts on display the weapons and armor that most often are used to attack private homes, unseen by anyone except the people who live there.  Although non-blacks are not inherently part of the enemy, anyone such as a protester or journalist whose actions support the enemy is treated as one of them.  16 September 2014 (Urgent: Put a price on carbon emissions)  US citizens: sign this petition to put a price on carbon emissions.  16 September 2014 (Urgent: Disclose fracking chemicals)  US citizens: sign this petition to require disclosure of fracking chemicals.  16 September 2014 (Urgent: Abortions in Pennsylvania)  Everyone: call on the Pennsylvania legislature to stop impeding abortion.  16 September 2014 (NSA's penetration in Germany)  Information provided by Edward Snowden proves that the NSA has penetrated national and international networks operated by German companies in ways that they cannot figure out.  16 September 2014 (Global heating and plutocracy)  Naomi Klein connects global heating to the plutocratic system that has subjugated democracy.  Klein is right that reducing your personal energy consumption is not an effective action. Under a market system, the fossil fuel you don't use will be sold to someone else. The way to reduce the total use of fossil fuel is by macro-policies such as placing more tax on such use.  The let's-win-over-the-billionaires environmentalism that Klein shows is ineffective is the climate analogue of "open source," which says, "Let's win over the businesses by not saying things they wouldn't like." They got a lot of  shallow success, but it didn't have deep roots.  16 September 2014 (Endangered sharks)  Shark meat is popular in Indonesia, and tuna fishers catch and sell lots of endangered sharks as "by catch".  16 September 2014 (Yangtze river sturgeon going extinct)  The Yangtze river sturgeon is following the Yangtze river dolphin into extinction.  16 September 2014 (UK prison budget cuts)  In the UK, prisoners regularly die or commit suicide as a result of prison budget cuts. They see no point in reporting when they are raped.  There are no funds for rehabilitation, which puts a burden on the rest of society when they get out.  16 September 2014 (Massive surveillance in New Zealand)  The Prime Minister of New Zealand says that there is no massive surveillance there. Edward Snowden proves he is lying.  This was implemented in 2012/2013, under a law that was misrepresented as having a much smaller effect.  16 September 2014 (California drought)  The almond farms of California are rapidly exhausting the state's ground water.  Global heating will make droughts in California more frequent. For the short term, the state needs to manage its water rather than allow farmers to pump it at will.  For the long term&hellip;there won't be much farming in California, by and by, unless we curb global heating.  16 September 2014 (Unschoolers)  A study of unschoolers &mdash; people who were allowed as children to learn on their own for some years &mdash; shows that they turned out quite well as adults. They had no trouble getting into college or being successful there.  I suspect that one of the conditions for this to be successful was that the children did not feel the threat of poverty and were not surrounded by despair. It might not work for most children of the non-rich in the US today.  16 September 2014 (China harassing foreign journalists)  China is systematically harassing and excluding foreign journalists, and pressuring their Chinese assistants to spy on them.  The US is not blemish-free in this area: it requires foreign journalists to get a special visa. The US should repeal this law so that it can effectively criticize other countries.  16 September 2014 (The right to offend people)  A teenager in Pennsylvania faces two years in prison for faking oral sex with a statue of Jesus.  This law should certainly be unconstitutional. The right to offend people is part of freedom of speech.  16 September 2014 (Ransoming hostages)  The relatives of James Foley report that US officials told them that paying a ransom for him would be a crime.  This policy is just and necessary to avoid encouraging the taking of more hostages. Foley's relatives, mad with grief, would have saved Foley by endangering others; the officials prevented this. It's not that they didn't understand what it's like to be a relative of a hostage. Rather, it's that they recognized their duty was not solely to that family. I only wish President Reagan could have been prosecuted for ransoming hostages from terrorists.  The one doubt that occurs to me is whether ransoming hostages might encourage terrorism less than letting them be used in the snuff videos that are effective propaganda for ISIS. The current policy was not chosen for a situation like this, which nobody envisioned.  Meanwhile, it is foolish to criticize the US government for not rescuing Foley. I'm sure the Pentagon was looking for a chance to rescue these hostages, but that is much easier said than done. Many attempts to rescue hostages have ended up killing them instead.  There are plenty of reasons to criticize US foreign policy, but we shouldn't endorse every criticism just because the US is its target.  16 September 2014 (More hunger as agribusiness grows)  The concentration of agribusiness has resulted in record production while hunger continues to grow.  16 September 2014 (Asylum-seekers in Australia)  Asylum-seekers in Australia are treated worse than the inmates of asylums; they can be put in solitary confinement for long periods.  I hope the recent supreme court decision puts an end to this.  16 September 2014 (National ID cards)  The Modi government expressed doubts about mandatory ID cards, before the election. Now in power it strongly supports the imposition of ID cards.  Requiring a national ID card is an injustice in itself; taking everyone's fingerprints or iris scans is an even worse injustice.  16 September 2014 (Republicans United)  Not one Republican voted for the amendment to reverse the "Citizens United" decision.  15 September 2014 ("Bombing" ISIS)  Obama Is Picking Targets in Iraq and Syria While Missing the Point.  US officials have big disagreements about how dangerous ISIS is, and whether bombing will hurt it or help it.  The question is confused because the term "bombing" fails to distinguish between air strikes on troops engaged in battle and drone assassinations, but this distinction is crucial. Tactical air support focuses on heavy weapons and military vehicles, and it is easy to distinguish them from civilians. People don't have heavy weapons or HUMVs at home, even in Iraq. Thus, air support causes few civilian casualties, and those few, when they occur, are understandable.  By contrast, drone assassinations often kill civilians in their homes and cars; in Pakistan and Yemen, those casualties, coming literally and figuratively out of the blue, have inspired understandable lasting hatred against the US.  For the moment, the US campaign against ISIS is mostly air support for the armies fighting ISIS. I'm in favor of providing such support. We see already that it is effective: it has prevented ISIS from conquering thousands of people and likely butchering them wholesale. It has also resulted in rather easy recapture of substantial territory, a vital dam, and some towns. As long as ISIS maintains armies fighting in the field, fighting them this way will be effective for the same reasons.  But Obama's speech shows he envisions continuing the fighting into a drone assassination campaign. A proper debate must treat those as two separate issues.  A drone assassination campaign in Iraq would be self-defeating as well as unjustifiable. Iraqi Sunnis would form ranks behind ISIS in response to the civilian casualties, producing a stalemate of suffering like that in Yemen. Such a stalemate never leads to victory; each day, the US would face the choice to terminate it and lose, or continue it and cause additional pointless suffering to preserve the status quo.  When Congress debates fighting ISIS, as is its duty, it must distinguish these two forms of fighting. If I were a member of Congress, I would vote for air support on the battlefield, for as long as ISIS keeps fighting on battlefields, but insist on prohibiting assassination campaigns.  15 September 2014 (New model of "trade" negotiations)  NGOs call on Congress to adopt a new model of "trade" negotiations, with goals to be stated in advance.  Given a Congress not subservient to business, this new system could give good results &mdash; but our current Congress is too submissive to adopt it.  15 September 2014 (The Need For Solidarity)  The US suffers from a lack of feelings and activities of general solidarity.  15 September 2014 (Taliban advancing)  The Taliban are advancing in parts of Afghanistan.  It's sad, but predictable. The Afghan government's army doesn't have the motivation needed to resist the Taliban. Afghans who oppose the Taliban aren't motivated to fight as much as the Taliban are motivated to fight.  We could continue to keep the Taliban out with permanent US intervention. We could do that for as long as the US has resources to do it, which won't be forever (in a few decades, global heating will be causing disaster in the US). But permanent victory against the Taliban depends on Afghans. We could continue war there until we go broke, but at the end the Taliban would come back unless Afghans opposed to the Taliban.  15 September 2014 (Canada subjugated to Chinese investors)  Canada's government has, in effect, subjugated Canada to Chinese investors (including the Chinese state) by allowing them to sue secretly to demand changes in Canadian government policies.  This includes extremely dangerous pipeline plans.  To subject one's country to such a treaty constitutes treason, in my view. A new Canadian government should abrogate the treaty.  15 September 2014 (US media on pension cuts)  The mainstream US media describe cutting workers' pensions as "responsible". If the government is forced to break promises, break promises to the rich before promises to the non-rich.  15 September 2014 (Video of witnesses in Ferguson)  Witnesses recorded immediately after Michael Brown was shot dead said that he had his hands up.  15 September 2014 ("Just-in-time" work schedule)  "Just-in-time" scheduling of hourly workers means that their part-time job rules them every hour of the week, although they only get paid for a fraction of those hours.  I think that businesses should be required to pay half wages for every hour that an hourly worker is on call to work with less than a week's notice.  15 September 2014 (Urgent: Authorization for expanding war in Iraq or Syria)  US citizens: call on Obama to get authorization for expanding war in Iraq or Syria.  For background.  15 September 2014 (Obama's plans for war with ISIS)  Obama's plans for war with ISIS depend on allies that have not shown an ability to do what is required.  I think the article underestimates the peshmerga. They had to retreat when ISIS attacked with its captured US heavy weapons and armored vehicles, but were able to advance with US air support. So were the Shi'ite Iraqi militias. The problem with them is that strengthening them pushes Iraqi Sunnis to support ISIS.  15 September 2014 (Australia's ancient rock art threatened)  Australia's ancient rock art is threatened by miners, tourists and animals.  15 September 2014 (Boko Haram suffered a big defeat)  Boko Haram suffered a big defeat in a pitched battle in Nigeria.  One such defeat won't destroy the group, but could inspire the Nigerian army to fight harder from now on, if the government gives this priority.  15 September 2014 (New Jersey prosecutor McClain)  New Jersey prosecutor McClain went easy on a football player that knocked his fianc&eacute;e unconscious, but threw the book at a women for carrying a gun with a permit from Pennsylvania.  To carry a gun for protection against future robberies is not necessarily a wise idea; it may cause more danger than it avoids. That's an unrelated issue and has no effect on this one, but I shouldn't mention the idea of getting a gun for self-protection without mentioning these doubts also.  15 September 2014 (Advertising on NPR)  The new CEO of National Public Radio intends to get more money from advertising by advertising more attractive products.  I used to give money to a local NPR station, but I stopped when I noticed that the shows had started to include commercials.  15 September 2014 (Urgent: Encryption standards)  US citizens: call on Congress to remove the requirement for NIST to consult the NSA specially about encryption standards.  15 September 2014 (Republican filibuster)  A Republican filibuster killed the constitutional amendment to stop companies from buying elections for Republicans.  15 September 2014 (Universities' choice of professors)  The Koch brothers are trying to buy control over universities' choice of professors, for political purposes.  15 September 2014 (China rents pandas to zoos)  China rents pandas to zoos for a lot of money as part of a general system of pressuring countries for trade advantage. Meanwhile, the habitat for wild pandas is being wiped out.  14 September 2014 (Being scared of partner not "normal")  A relationship where the woman says she is scared of the man should not be considered "normal".  14 September 2014 (Gun control activist threatened)  The leader of a gun control protest in Chicago is receiving death threats from US gun nuts, who call him a "terrorist".  He isn't one, but they and their threats are coming pretty close.  14 September 2014 (Campaigns of false criticism)  Zoe Quinn is the victim of a campaign of false criticism that was organized dishonestly from the beginning by people that wanted to do her harm.  You can see something similar though smaller in the attacks against me that are posted in some forums. They not only make strained criticism, they also misrepresent the free software movement drastically (as you can see for yourself by comparing their statements with gnu.org).  14 September 2014 (War)  This Is the Third World War &mdash; And This Time We Are on the Fringes.  I think there is some truth in this, but it's not entirely true. Conflict between Shi'ites and Sunnis, like conflict between Catholics and Orthodox and Muslims in the former Yugoslavia, is not inevitable. It is stimulated or provoked by political parties that expect short-term gain, and many of them could theoretically be convinced to stop.  14 September 2014 (Deforestation)  Most deforestation on Earth is done commercially, and half of it is done to get products to sell to the wealthy countries.  Deforestation in the Amazon jumped by almost 1/3 last year.  14 September 2014 (Urgent: Preserve food labeling law)  US citizens: call on your senators to preserve the US law requiring food to be labeled by the country of origin.  14 September 2014 (UN's vote on stopping oppressive debt)  The UN General Assembly voted to start negotiations on a treaty to allow states to get rid of oppressive debt.  The US was among 10 countries that voted against. Shame on you, Obama.  14 September 2014 (The courage that saved the ozone layer)  Stopping Climate Meltdown Needs the Courage That Saved the Ozone Layer.  That means daring to tell powerful businesses to drop dead rather than let them kill us.  14 September 2014 (Ebola intervention)  Scientist Who Identified Ebola Virus Calls for "Quasi-Military Intervention".  14 September 2014 (Expensive UK privatizations)  The UK government is trying to set up privatizations so that they are too expensive to cancel.  They act like raiders who have taken control of the state and intend to destroy as much as they can before they are chased out.  The just response would be to impose a 200% tax on those businesses, or make it a crime to continue to exercise such a contract.  13 September 2014 ("School police" get armored vehicle)  San Diego's "school police" has acquired a mine-resistant armored vehicle. They must think students will riot against whatever follows the Common Core and might turn to improvised explosive devices.  13 September 2014 (Citing BP for "gross negligence")  Citing BP for "gross negligence" hardly did justice to the company's persistent pattern of safety violations around the world.  13 September 2014 (Key Points from Obama's Isis Speech)  Seven Key Points from Obama's Isis Speech And What They Actually Mean.  I disagree with the article on the conclusion of the first point. If it's a question of fighting threats to the US, it does not follow that the US should only fight the worst one. But this is a side issue, since it's relevant only if you believe that the most important thing about ISIS is whether it threatens the US directly.  The second point's conclusion is simply wrong. There is nothing "preventive" about responding to a continuing armed attack.  However, the other five points are valid.  13 September 2014 (University of Sydney disinvites NGOs)  The University of Sydney disinvited two Sri Lankan NGOs from an international human rights event, caving to pressure from Sri Lanka's brutal government.  13 September 2014 (Dictatorship in Russia)  People have called Belarus "Europe's last dictatorship", but Russia has more or less become equal to it.  Regardless of what organizations it may join, Azerbaijan is not in Europe. It is in the Middle East.  13 September 2014 (NSA interception of mail packages)  It appears that the NSA intercepted the Thinkpad keyboard that Andrea Shepard, a Tor developer in Seattle, had ordered from Amazon. Presumably this was to sabotage it. I wonder if people have studied this keyboard to see what the NSA changed.  If you are any sort of activist, don't order a computer by mail yourself. Have a friend order it, after discussing the plan in person with no mobile phones around.  13 September 2014 (Divest from fossil fuel companies)  Almost 250 teachers at Boston University have called on the university to divest from fossil fuel companies.  It is clear that conservation measures in Boston University itself will have only a tiny influence on world fossil fuel consumption. In a market system, if A decides not to buy some commodity, the price goes down and B or C buys more. We need to change the parameters of the system itself.  The direct financial effect of divestment by Boston University alone would also be small, but this approach has a better chance to turn into a movement by many universities, and that could intern influence policies to change the parameters.  13 September 2014 (Apple redesigning iThings)  Apple is redesigning iThings to help companies communicate users' personal data from one to another, and enable them to manipulate users better. This page shows the perverse viewpoint of someone who is on the companies' side and presents this malice as an advance.  They are also now designed to make it harder for victims to keep control of their budgets.  It is a truism that "if you don't pay, you're the product." But now we see that, with proprietary software, you are often the product even if you do pay.  13 September 2014 (Urgent: Remove Koch brother from WGBH board)  In Boston: rally at 3pm on Oct 1, at WGBH headquarters (1 Guest St), to remove a Koch brother from the WGBH board.  13 September 2014 (Constitutional limits on imprisonment of asylum seekers)  Australia's supreme court placed constitutional limits on imprisonment of asylum seekers.  13 September 2014 (Criminal Investigations into Gaza Attacks)  Israeli Military Orders Criminal Investigations into Gaza Attacks.  This is a promising development if they do an honest job, but I fear its purpose is only to deflect criticism.  13 September 2014 (Reducing US greenhouse gas emissions)  Presenting a feasible program of investment to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030.  It's doable, but the fossil fuel companies don't want it to be done. They intend to to force us to stay on track to global catastrophe.  13 September 2014 (Russia sent another convoy of "humanitarian aid")  Russia sent another convoy of "humanitarian aid" into Ukraine without Red Cross inspection.  I am sure they are carrying ammunition. If not, Putin would have had the Red Cross inspect them so he could refute such accusations.  13 September 2014 (Russian military vehicle spotted in Ukraine)  A Russian military vehicle was spotted in Ukraine. The soldiers running it said they were Russian mercenaries. Then they repainted it to disguise its origin.  13 September 2014 (Global heating effects threaten agriculture)  Global heating effects threaten agriculture, and the more diverse agriculture is, the better it can withstand those effects. Big agribusiness monoculture is driving agriculture in the wrong direction.  13 September 2014 (Turkey has increased internet censorship)  Turkey has increased internet censorship.  Internet censorship was one of the early signs that Erdogan was going to attack human rights in Turkey.  12 September 2014 (Israeli intel vets speak out)  43 veterans of Israel's military intelligence (equivalent to the NSA in the US) denounced their work as a system of oppression and political manipulation rather than a matter of national security.  The full text of their letter.  Quotes from their personal testimonies: The fact people were innocent was not at all relevant.  12 September 2014 (Fear of Ebola in Sierra Leone)  Fear of Ebola is making Sierra Leone life crazy.  In Liberia, MSF's treatment center is full.  12 September 2014 (US evidence about flight MA-17)  The US has declined to show whatever evidence it has about who shot down flight MA-17.  I find it implausible anyone intentionally fired at an airliner. Thus I believe that rebels fired at what they thought was a Ukrainian government plane.  12 September 2014 (Teacher risks dismissal for kids)  A Florida teacher is risking dismissal by refusing to spend a week administering a standardized computerized test.  12 September 2014 (Corporations at climate summits)  The UN has allowed corporations' interests to pervade the climate summits.  12 September 2014 (Illness caused by fracking)  In Pennsylvania, fracking causes illness in 40% of the households within 1km of a frackwell.  Fracking probably contributes even more to global heating than coal. Fracking should be banned, so that as we cut down coal mining, it is not replaced by another fossil fuel.  12 September 2014 (Fijian peacekeepers released)  Jabhat al-Nusra released the 45 Fijian peacekeepers that it took prisoner two weeks ago.  The job of these peacekeepers was to separate Syrian and Israeli forces. I think that no forces currently separate al-Nusra from the Israeli border.  12 September 2014 (Urgent: Stop funding global heating denial)  Everyone: call on Google, Microsoft and others to stop supporting global heating denialists.  12 September 2014 (Clinton's push for fracking)  How Hillary Clinton's State Department Sold Fracking to the World.  12 September 2014 (Reversal of ozone hole growth)  The ban on chlorofluorocarbons is starting to reverse the former growth of the ozone hole.  11 September 2014 (Obama trying to stretch presidential authority)  Obama is trying to stretch presidential authority to cover air attacks anywhere in the world. This is a dangerous precedent.  Obama calls ISIS a "terrorist group", but I think that term is misleading. ISIS does not seem to have carried out any terrorist attacks against civilians. It is murderous and oppressive, but in a different form. I would call it a gang army. They have been known for many years in the eastern Congo and other parts of Africa.  Obama says he will employ the tactic of drone assassination against ISIS because it has been so successful in Yemen and Somalia. The Islamist militias in those countries don't seem to have been defeated by years of drone assassinations.  The current round of air strikes against ISIS don't pose the same problems because they take the form of close air support in field battles. It is easy to distinguish soldiers with heavy weapons from civilians, so mistakes are unlikely. If some civilians are hit, their relatives will understand that battle zones are dangerous places to be.  But it appears that Obama expects the fight against ISIS to develop into an assassination campaign. If it does, it will generate support for ISIS.  11 September 2014 (New plan for Detroit's water supply)  The new plan for Detroit's water supply eliminates public accountability and paves the way towards future privatization.  11 September 2014 (Israel imprisoned retired Palestinian professor)  Israel has imprisoned a retired Palestinian professor, Yousef Abdul Haq, without charges.  Abdul Haq has been active in organizing nonviolent resistance to the occupation. It's not the first time he has been imprisoned without charges.  11 September 2014 (Wounded in Gaza struggle to find medical treatment)  12,000 wounded people in Gaza struggle to find medical treatment in the remaining hospitals.  11 September 2014 (The modern American witch hunt)  As part of the modern American witch hunt, a woman was convicted of endangering a fetus because she took methadone prescribed by her doctor.  11 September 2014 (Inability to buy newsprint)  Inability to buy newsprint is forcing some Venezuelan newspapers to close.  It takes dollars to buy imported paper, and how many bolivares you have to pay for each dollar depends on your level of privilege.  11 September 2014 (No reason to think ISIS wants to attack US)  The Secretary of Homeland Security says there is no reason to think ISIS wants to attack the US.  Don't be taken in by the exaggeration of politicians.  11 September 2014 (Atheist US Air Force officer is suing)  An Atheist US Air Force officer is suing for permission to take his oath of service without citing a deity &mdash; something that the Air Force permitted until a year ago.  11 September 2014 (Former Israeli officials back peace plan)  Former Israeli intelligence officials say Israel should agree to the Arab peace plan.  11 September 2014 (Praise for Steven Salaita)  Praise for Steven Salaita from other teachers and from his students.  Salaita was offered a job by the University of Illinois, which treacherously rescinded the offer a couple of weeks before the start of the school year.  11 September 2014 (Boycott of Israeli products)  Palestinians are boycotting Israeli products.  11 September 2014 (IPCC proposal for dealing with debt)  The IPCC proposed that governments surrender to their debt by borrowing more money to cope with the damage caused by global heating.  This would wipe out what remains of democracy in the world, and would not even reliably do what it is supposed to do.  Since the debt is the result of an unjust plutocratic regime, it needs to be erased, not be catered to by increasing debt.  11 September 2014 (Chinese censorship)  Chinese censorship demonstrates that the internet empowers tyrannical regimes, if they are clever.  To argue for human rights based on efficiency is turning things upside down. Freedom is more important than efficiency. We should sacrifice efficiency for freedom if necessary.  If we want freedom in the internet, we can't assume that will happen due to the nature of the internet. We have to fight for it. YOU have to fight for it.  11 September 2014 (ISIS and the fear-war complex)  The fear-war complex has convinced lots of Americans that ISIS is a direct threat to the US.  The US government is planning to pressure Iraq to adopt a federal scheme for the "security forces".  (Note that the article errs in speaking of the "Sunni majority". The Sunnis are a minority in Iraq, and the Iraqi government is controlled by the Shi'ite majority, which has used this power to oppress the Sunni minority.)  I don't know enough to say this can work, but it seems to be at least vaguely headed in a sensible direction.  However, the idea of supporting Syrians that are fighting both Assad and ISIS has serious problems: some of them are almost as fanatical Islamists as ISIS, and the rest tend to treat Islamists as rivals rather than enemies.  11 September 2014 (Persecution of homeless people)  Hawai'i's hotels are pushing to make it a crime to sleep or even sit on the sidewalk in Honolulu. The proper answer to those hotels is, "Give the homeless people a better place to sleep and sit, or shut up!"  Meanwhile, providing a camp on Sand Island is better than what many other US cities are doing.  11 September 2014 (Neo-Nazi Azov militia mumbling)  The neo-Nazi Azov militia battalion mumbles about overthrowing the government of Ukraine.  11 September 2014 (Russian troops withdrawn from Ukraine)  Ukraine says Russia has withdrawn most of its troops.  Offering some sort of partial autonomy to eastern Ukraine seems like a fine thing to do, and should not have required a war.  11 September 2014 (Global fight for a neutral net)  Join the global fight for a neutral net: Big Telecom vs THE WORLD.  11 September 2014 (B'Tselem to stop sharing with army)  The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem says it will not provide evidence of war crimes to the Israeli army, because the army has proved not to try seriously to investigate such crimes.  11 September 2014 (Funding for West Bank settlements)  Israel gives preferential funding to people living in colonies in Palestine.  11 September 2014 (Special Ops corporate bonanza)  Murky Special Ops Have Become Corporate Bonanza, Says Report.  11 September 2014 (Queensland bans suing to block mines)  Queensland, a state in Australia, has banned the general public from suing to block mines on environmental grounds.  Thus, when the state government is inclined to close its eyes to probable environmental harm &mdash; which it clearly is, or it would not pass such a law &mdash; citizens will be helpless to prevent the harm.  11 September 2014 (Effects of daily marijuana use)  A study finds that people under 17 years old that use marijuana every day suffer various harmful effects.  I don't think this can justify prohibition, because prohibition hurts a much larger number of people.  It is possible, though, that these teenagers used marijuana so much because they already had problems.  11 September 2014 (Urgent: Walmart video showing killing)  Everyone: Call on Walmart to release the video showing the killing of John Crawford.  11 September 2014 (Urgent: Stop harassment for student loans)  US citizens: call on the Department of Education to stop hiring debt collection companies to harass people for student loans.  We really need to restore the possibility to eliminate student loans through bankruptcy. Until we do that, this is a necessary first step.  11 September 2014 (Congressional approval of war)  Obama believes he is allowed to order bombing of Syria without congress.  If the president is allowed to bomb any country if he can convince it to accept some "noncombat" US troops, the requirement for Congressional approval of war is almost completely negated. Congress is inclined to approve this campaign, but it should demand to be asked so it can say yes.  11 September 2014 (Israel presents "evidence")  Israel presented a video from 2009 as "evidence" that Palestinians were firing from al-Wafa hospital.  The video was of a different building, and was put together with an unrelated audio track talking about a house (not a big building).  11 September 2014 (Hindu fanatics)  Hindu fanatics in India say they are going to convert "all" Christians and Muslims. This could only be done by threats of violence.  Meanwhile, when supposedly "Hindu" Dalits try to convert officially to Buddhism, they face violent interference.  11 September 2014 (Arbitrary detention in Australia)  Australia's government says Australians shouldn't worry about being arbitrarily stopped from leaving the country, because the officials will be so well trained that they will never make a mistake.  11 September 2014 (Teachout gets 1/3 of the vote)  Zephyr Teachout got 1/3 of the vote in the New York gubernatorial primary against incumbent business-subservient Democrat Andrew Cuomo.  11 September 2014 (Rapists protected by UK thugs)  An organized gang that raped children in the UK was protected assiduously by thugs: when a researcher discovered what was going on and reported it, they threatened to expose the researcher to the gang.  There are laws that dishonestly claim that every time someone under 16 or 18 (depending on where) has sex, it is "rape". Calling willing sex "rape" does not make it rape, and calling a 17-year-old who wants to have sex a "child" does not make that teenager a child.  However, this gang committed real rapes, and other real violence, and its victims included real children.  11 September 2014 (New rules of Federal Reserve Bank)  A subtle change in the rules of the Federal Reserve Bank (an organization run by the big US banks) requires those banks to dump municipal bonds. This could force many US cities into bankruptcy.  11 September 2014 (Crop varieties)  Development of new crop varieties depends on wild relatives of the crops, but global heating puts those relatives in danger.  11 September 2014 (CIA water torture)  CIA water torture was even more vicious than previously reported.  If the US wants to be morally superior to ISIS, it must punish all the torturers from Dubya on down.  11 September 2014 (Methane leaks from fracking)  Obama and Clinton take note: due to methane leaks, fracking is a bridge to nowhere. We must aim for renewables without delay.  The US leads the way in failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  11 September 2014 (Famous tree-huggers)  Famous tree-huggers can inspire us to actions that could save Earth's climate.  A Massachusetts district attorney dropped charges against two anti-coal protesters because he concluded their actions were justified to prevent global disaster.  11 September 2014 (UK's excuses to fine the poor)  The UK government has created lots of excuses to fine the poor, so it is no surprise that one man's death is directly tied to fining him.  11 September 2014 (Ferguson court fine income)  Ferguson's city council is voting to limit court fine income to 15% of the city revenue, instead of 21% as now.  What directly oppresses the poor citizens of Ferguson is the rules that the system follows, such as fining people for being unable to pay fines. Cutting out a little over 1/4 of the fines is insufficient to make a qualitative difference.  Some of the other changes might matter more.  11 September 2014 (If the US goes to war with ISIS)  If the US goes to war with ISIS, how long before Americans conclude that it was a mistake?  ISIS is evil enough that fighting ISIS is not inherently wrong. The same was true for Saddam Hussein &mdash; but launching a war against his regime made things worse in Iraq, and the same thing could easily happen again.  Thwarting ISIS in a conventional war of movement is easy. Destroying ISIS would mean an urban guerrilla war, which would be horrible (as it was 8 years ago in the same part of Iraq) and would not succeed. To really defeat ISIS requires convincing Iraq's Sunnis to kick ISIS out.  11 September 2014 (Limiting global heating)  Limiting global heating to 2C was an arbitrary target, and appears to be too much heating for safety.  11 September 2014 (Violence between individuals)  Violence between individuals kills ten times as many people as wars, and costs 40 times as much.  11 September 2014 (US customs bans famous French cheeses)  A silly and annoying rule change by US customs has banned famous French cheeses.  Another silly and annoying US customs rule is the one that prohibits import of all meat products, even soup mixes. Yes, it is conceivable that they could carry a prion disease &mdash; but nobody is going to feed the soup to cattle.  11 September 2014 (Ill treatment of models)  Models are in danger of being denied their pay unless they diet to an extent that is dangerously unhealthy. Except the stars, of course.  These abuses resemble what we see in other fields of work, so I wonder if there are general solutions that cover all fields.  For instance, how does it happen that models start in debt? Should it be a crime to make workers pay money to get a job?  11 September 2014 (Greenhouse gas emissions)  Greenhouse gas emissions in 2013 increased faster than any time since 1984.  11 September 2014 ("Open carry" for whites only)  John Crawford was shot dead by thugs in a Walmart while holding a BB gun he wanted to buy. It appears this was based on an exaggerated and false accusation from someone who was in the store.  The article shows why "open carry" laws effectively apply only to whites. It's too dangerous if you're black. Lawfully carrying a concealed gun can cause you trouble if you're a black; thugs frequently search you, and even though the gun is not a crime, the thugs will look for an excuse to charge you with something.  As a result, "stand your ground" laws are also whites-only.  10 September 2014 (Urgent: Publish consumers' complaints about financial companies)  US citizens: tell the CFPB to publish consumers' complaints about financial companies.  10 September 2014 (Urgent: Require frackers to disclose all the chemicals they use)  US citizens: call on the EPA to require frackers to disclose all the chemicals they use.  10 September 2014 (The ideology of ISIS)  The ideology of ISIS is based on modern European ideas, notwithstanding its pretension to return to the roots of Islam.  Exposing this might undermine ISIS propaganda.  10 September 2014 (Armored cars for thugs)  The manufactures of armored cars for thugs feel uncomfortable about admitting that they are made to repress protesters.  When US thugs use their military-style "counter-terrorism" gear for suppressing protests, it turns out to be illegal; thug departments that have done this could get in trouble.  Rather than fining these thug departments, it would be far more effective to take away their heavy weapons and armor.  Or maybe the rule won't get enforced.  10 September 2014 (Bahrain continues to repress dissidents)  Bahrain continues to repress dissidents.  10 September 2014 (US thugs have taken 2.5 billion dollars)  US thugs have taken 2.5 billion dollars in the past 13 years from people who were not charged with crimes.  No matter what Kafkaesque excuses they make, this is punishment without trial.  The US is also turning towards Pre-emptive prosecution, where the question is not whether you committed a crime but whether you might.  10 September 2014 (EU's dependence on Russia for natural gas)  The EU's dependence on Russia for natural gas is creating strong pressure for energy efficiency improvements.  10 September 2014 (TEPCO is withholding pay)  TEPCO is withholding pay from Fukushima cleanup workers.  One would think that such an important job, which has to be done right, should offer high pay to get the best workers.  10 September 2014 (Clinton's glowing review of Kissinger's book)  Clinton's glowing review of Kissinger's book shows what she is really made of.  10 September 2014 (Life Sentences for Some Homosexual Acts)  Gambia Passes Bill Imposing Life Sentences for Some Homosexual Acts.  10 September 2014 (Urgent: Call on OceanaGold to drop lawsuit)  Everyone: call on OceanaGold to drop its lawsuit which claims El Salvador is not allowed to protect its water supplies.  10 September 2014 (Deforesters murdered Peruvian activists)  Deforesters murdered Peruvian activists that campaigned against illegal logging.  10 September 2014 (US spending millions on aid projects that don't work)  In Africa, as formerly in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US is spending millions on aid projects that generally don't work because they never made sense.  10 September 2014 (Urgent: Get a warrant before using drones)  Everyone: urge California Gov Brown to sign the bill that requires thugs to get a warrant before using drones.  10 September 2014 (Accusation of sharing)  The BBC wants to make ISPs in Australia punish their customers on accusation of sharing &mdash; including anyone that makes heavy use of a VPN.  10 September 2014 (An end to the War on Drugs)  A group of former presidents and ministers calls for an end to the War on Drugs.  10 September 2014 (Poverty wages)  Janitors don't have to be paid poverty wages &mdash; if they unionize.  10 September 2014 (Modi has started denying global heating)  Modi, since his election, has started denying global heating.  Apparently he has surrendered to the "burn, baby, burn" lobby.  10 September 2014 (Urgent: Oppose Pebble Mine)  US citizens: tell the EPA not to allow the Pebble Mine.  10 September 2014 (Qatar slavery investigators freed)  The slavery investigators disappeared in Qatar have been freed.  10 September 2014 (Today's climate models)  Today's climate models, applied to 1990s data, predicted the slowdown in atmospheric heating of the 2000s.  There was no slowdown in global heating; rather, heat started going into the oceans rather than the low atmosphere.  10 September 2014 (Global heating threatens US birds)  Over half the bird species in the US, including the bald eagle, are threatened by global heating.  10 September 2014 (Still Scared Stupid)  Still Scared Stupid in the Age of Terrorism.  10 September 2014 (Greenpeace protesters face prosecution)  Greenpeace protesters in the US face felony prosecutions for a banner drop.  Putin in America?  10 September 2014 (Spanish thugs buying more arms)  Spanish thugs are buying more arms to escalate repression of suffering Spaniards.  10 September 2014 (Kidnaping of Estonian detective)  More about Russia's armed kidnaping of an Estonian detective.  10 September 2014 (NYC thugs beat handcuffed man)  A gang of 6 thugs in New York City handcuffed a man and then hit him repeatedly with sticks.  10 September 2014 (Companies show no shame at "Urban Shield")  The companies that sell armored vehicles and automatic weapons to US thugs are showing no shame at "Urban Shield".  09 September 2014 (Big Ag in Oregon)  Big Ag in Oregon procured a law giving farms immunity for dropping toxic pesticides on people's houses.  09 September 2014 (The US justice system)  The US justice system will believe in the impossible, to excuse killings by thugs, or to keep someone in jail.  09 September 2014 (Russia's population decreasing)  Russia's population has been decreasing for over 20 years; Russians die younger and have few children. One author says this is because Russian society has learned to give up hope.  If that is true &mdash; I don't take it as certain &mdash; then it probably relates to the cruel capitalism that took over Russia in 1991. The same thing might happen in the US if the plutocrats cement their power.  09 September 2014 (NY thugs get creative for arrest)  New York thugs got creative to find an excuse to arrest a woman who had left a protest, as she waited near a restaurant for her family to come out of the toilet.  09 September 2014 (UK immigration prison death)  A UK immigration prison appears to have killed a prisoner by doing nothing when he reported chest pains. When his relatives asked what happened, they were told he had committed suicide.  09 September 2014 (Killed by thugs after traffic stop)  Illinois thugs have refused to tell Joshua Paul's family any details of why and how they killed him.  09 September 2014 (Death penalty unjustified)  In 1994, Justice Scalia cited two cases as examples that the death penalty could be incontrovertibly justified. One of them was the case of the two men just proved innocent by DNA evidence.  08 September 2014 (Urgent: Oppose enlarging pipeline)  US citizens: call on Obama and Kerry not to let Enbridge double the size of the Alberta Clipper tar oil pipeline.  Also submit a public comment to the State Department.  08 September 2014 (Zero-carbon-emissions society)  To avoid disaster, we should convert with all possible speed to a zero-carbon-emissions society.  I have to comment on some minor points.  It is a shame to cite Bill Gates as a positive example of anything. If the point is valid, it can be established without mentioning him. I distrust carbon offset schemes because many of them make presumptions about future activities that may not come true.  But these do not invalidate the article's conclusion. They only affect side issues.  08 September 2014 (Natural gas in Ukraine)  Ukraine has lots of natural gas that could make it an ideal target for fracking, especially if it is in debt to the IMF and can't resist.  The article erects a large superstructure of theories which I think are strained and not convincing.  08 September 2014 (US widening air bombing in Iraq)  The US is widening its air bombing intervention in Iraq.  As long as it remains limited to giving close air support to a local ground army fighting in a non-urban battlefield, the harm to civilians will be limited too. If it goes beyond that, it could become the sort of hatred-generator that drone attacks in Pakistan and Yemen have been.  08 September 2014 (The Rise of the Warrior Cop)  The Rise of the Warrior Cop describe the horror felt in the early US about mixing the roles of army and police, and how Nixon's "War on Dregs" started to endorse mixing them up.  08 September 2014 (Estonian investigator kidnaped)  Russian troops or thugs kidnaped an Estonian investigator from a customs office on Estonian territory; the former KGB now claims he was captured in Russia.  08 September 2014 (Anti-slavery activist on trial)  Anti-slavery activist Andy Hall has gone on trial in Thailand as punishment for a stellar career of defending the rights of migrant workers.  08 September 2014 (Voter ID laws)  Judge Posner said his ruling in favor of voter ID laws was wrong.  The ruling, which disenfranchised over 70,000 black voters in one state still threatens US democracy.  There are too many activities in the US which require a government-issued ID card, and this threatens to turn state driver-or-equivalent licenses into the equivalent of a national ID card.  08 September 2014 (If Israel wants security)  For Israel, the Beginning of Wisdom Is to Admit Its Mistakes. If Israel wants security, it should stop the policies that insure Palestine can't have any security.  08 September 2014 (Human rights defenders arrested in Qatar)  Qatar has admitted arresting two foreign human rights defenders who were investigating slavery in Qatar.  The delay in announcing this shows that the government hoped the world would not notice, and that the "illegalities", if not fabricated, are violations of laws Qatar will be ashamed to have.  08 September 2014 (Nigera imposing biometric ID cards)  Nigeria is imposing biometric ID cards that include fingerprints and iris scans. And share all the data with Mastercard.  National ID cards such as this are inherently oppressive  07 September 2014 (Abottt campaign promises)  Abbott is betting that if he repeats over and over that he did not break his campaign promises, voters will forget that he did.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Defend network neutrality)  US citizens: if you haven't already, submit a comment to the FCC defending network neutrality.  07 September 2014 (Debates between right-wing pundits that all agree)  Mainstream US TV political shows present debates between right-wing pundits that all agree the US should launch all-out war against ISIS.  "Three things that won't defeat Isis are a kneejerk reaction to the videos of western hostages being killed, going back to the old models of dictatorship and airstrikes."  Above all, it is necessary to show Iraqi Sunnis how they can have a government they generally won't feel is their enemy.  Perhaps that requires offering to break up Iraq, so they can have their own government as long as it isn't warlike.  07 September 2014 (Kidnaped journalists)  Many journalists have been kidnaped in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Secrecy in many individual cases has hidden the size of the problem.  07 September 2014 (NATO)  NATO: Part of Solution [in Ukraine] &mdash; Or Problem.  I think the question is not quite right. Nato expansion has clearly contributed to provoking Russia, but that doesn't prevent NATO from being useful for resisting Russia. Putin is not an innocent good guy, he is a former KGB officer.  07 September 2014 (If the bank doesn't make you homeless, thugs might try)  In Philadelphia, if the bank doesn't make you homeless, the thugs might try it.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act)  US citizens: support the Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act.  07 September 2014 (Atheist fanatics)  Violent religious fanatics are a real danger, but there are no violent atheist fanatics nowadays. The closest thing you can find are a few Communist dictatorships. They are cited to create a false appearance of moral equivalence between secularism and religion.  People do not need religion in order to treat each other well. Humans (except sociopaths) have a conscience as a matter of instinct, and can train it through reflection. It can even have the strength to prevail over religious immorality.  A story from Samoa (*) says that the religious practice of human sacrifice was ended when the son of the Malietoa (one of the top-level chiefs) saw that the woman he loved was going to be sacrificed, and presented himself for the sacrifice in place of her. The Malietoa, rather than sacrifice his son, banned human sacrifice thenceforth. Whether or not this really occurred, the repetition of the story shows that a human society can value conscience over religion, and it makes an instructive contrast with the story of Abraham and Isaac.  * From Les religions du Pacifique et d'Australie by Nevermann, Worms, and Petri.  07 September 2014 (US rate of job generation)  The US rate of job generation fell to a new low, less than ever since the 1970s.  The 1970s is the last time we had a government that represented Americans other than the elites.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Hold a rally for network neutrality)  In the US: hold a rally for network neutrality.  07 September 2014 (FBI censors Justice Dept. report)  The Justice Department's Inspector General released a report about how the FBI can bypass new "guidelines" about getting journalists' phone records and other data, but the FBI censored it so badly that all we know is that it's a secret.  07 September 2014 (Eritrean refugee gets asylum in UK)  An Eritrean, imprisoned because of his religious sect, took 3 years to reach Britain, where he received asylum.  He had to fend off kidnapers in Sudan, which also lets the Eritrean agents seize Eritrean refugees.  One thing I do not understand is why he snuck into the UK from Calais rather than asking for asylum in France. What is the attraction or advantage of the UK for a person who has a valid claim to asylum? Does anyone know?  07 September 2014 (Facebook's "curated" newsfeed)  Twitter told people about protests and thug violence in Ferguson (those who are interested), while Facebook mostly steered people away.  07 September 2014 (ISIS torturer shoots four at Jewish Museum)  An ISIS torturer went to Brussels and shot four people at the Jewish Museum.  Why it would be a mistake to discourage jihadis from western countries from returning home if they have changed their mind about the issue.  07 September 2014 (Fast-food striker's motivation)  One fast-food striker explains how he chose to get arrested for his daughter's sake.  07 September 2014 (Making thugs wear cameras)  Making thugs wear cameras is not an automatic guaranteed solution to thuggishness. They tend to turn off their cameras when they shoot people &mdash; and the cameras can contribute to massive general surveillance. Careful rules are needed.  07 September 2014 (Australia's threatened species)  The Australian government wants to delegate protection of threatened species to the states, which are not in a position to do it properly even if they wanted to.  Of course, the point of the change is that the states don't even want to try.  07 September 2014 (US pressuring Canada to seize medicines)  The US is pressuring Canada to seize generic medicines in transit on behalf of patentholding pharma companies.  These laws are murderous; officials who carry out such seizures should be tried in the ICC.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Do more than weakly criticize Israel's continued land-grab)  US citizens: tell Kerry it is time to do more than weakly criticize Israel's continued land-grab in Palestine.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Support journalists' freedom to report)  US citizens: support journalists' freedom to report.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Stop selling off people's mortgages)  US citizens: Tell the Department of Housing to stop selling off people's mortgages to the same sort of "securitized" market that screwed them.  06 September 2014 (UK Green Party opposes plutocracy)  The UK Green Party is broadening its concerns to include opposing plutocracy.  It could replace the former UK Labour Party, which has transformed itself into a center-right party on economic issues.  06 September 2014 (Sierra Leone "lockdown")  Sierra Leone has declared a four-day "lockdown" in about two weeks to try to halt the spread of Ebola.  I think the need is sufficient to justify such a measure, but is it likely to work?  06 September 2014 (Abbott's attacks against environment)  Abbott treats Australia's environment as an enemy. These are his ten worst attacks against the environment.  06 September 2014 (Arrest at Moral Mondays protest)  At a Moral Mondays protest, thugs arrested a black politician for handing out voting rights leaflets (which is not a crime).  Right-wing Americans don't want people of minority groups to be able to vote, and in many states have passed laws designed to stop them.  06 September 2014 (Cell phone "interceptors")  Cell phone "interceptors", special modified cell towers, can take over a phone through the back door in the baseband processor.  06 September 2014 (ISIS barbarity)  ISIS waterboarded its captives.  What a shame it is to America to have set an example of barbarity for barbarians. The US must punish its torturers, starting with Bush.  As for the prisoners that can't be put on trial because torture taints the case against them, we must release them! So what if they go to ISIS or some affiliate of al Qa'ida? They won't add much to the strength of those organizations, but releasing them is crucial for the moral strength of the US.  06 September 2014 (Fast food workers' strike)  State representatives and even a congresswoman joined in fast food workers' strike protests.  06 September 2014 (Koch Operative)  Koch Operative: Raise the [minimum] Wage, Totalitarianism and Terrorism Follow?  06 September 2014 (UK cuts funds for food inspection)  The UK has cut funds for inspection of food and prosecution of food fraud to the point where fraud is easy and profitable. That's the Tory philosophy: make crime pay, when business wants it to.  06 September 2014 (Reducing militarization of thugs)  In San Jose, California, the thug department decided to act a little more like a police department, by getting rid of the armored repression vehicles that the US government gave it.  In Davis, it was the city council that made this wise decision, over the opposition of the thugs.  06 September 2014 (Harmful educational reform)  The supporters of harmful educational reform are asking for a less polarized discussion.  That's what right-wingers say when they are in the driver's seat and the people are getting angry enough to kick them out.  06 September 2014 (Urgent: Support fast food workers)  In the US: support the fast food workers strike.  06 September 2014 (Urgent: Oppose drilling in Beaufort Sea)  US citizens: oppose oil drilling in the Beaufort Sea, off the coast of the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge.  06 September 2014 (US oil production rising)  US oil production is rising, due to extraction of shale oil, and short-sighted politicians are claiming this is a good thing.  06 September 2014 (Bombing kills a leader of al-Shabaab)  A US bombing killed a leader of al-Shabaab.  I predict this will have as little effect as the killing of the previous leader. These groups don't depend on one person.  06 September 2014 (Collapse of case against Kenyatta)  The ICC case against Uhuru Kenyatta has collapsed because Kenya's refusal to cooperate has prevented collecting evidence.  06 September 2014 (Cease fire in Ukraine holding)  The cease fire in Ukraine is holding so far.  06 September 2014 (Towns controlled by Boko Haram)  Boko Haram has seized towns and held them, and the Nigerian army is not fighting back very well.  06 September 2014 (Blue whale population recovery)  The blue whales of California have recovered their numbers almost to pre-whaling levels, thanks to lots of protection efforts.  However, globally the blue whale population is only around 2% of what it was 140 years ago.  06 September 2014 (Defeating ISIS)  Obama says he wants to destroy ISIS, but will not escalate until there is an Iraqi army that is strong enough to win with help.  This means he is rejecting the pressure to do something rash and foolish.  However, he is straining the limits of the War Powers Act to the breaking point.  ISIS propaganda videos are designed to recruit individual supporters by making ISIS look tough and harsh.  It is a mistake to go to war because ISIS killed two Americans, or because ISIS kills people in a barbaric way. As has been pointed out, Saudi Arabia frequently kills people by beheading, and the practice is just as barbaric there.  The murder of thousands of Iraqis and Syrians, and religious oppression of those that live, are much bigger reasons to fight ISIS, but only if that is likely to be effective.  Could it be effective? This article, although it frames the issue in terms of "what do we need in order to win" rather than "does the approach make sense", points out that defeating ISIS is unlikely unless it is done by a more powerful army which is determined to fight and defeat ISIS, and which can cut off ISIS from its supply of recruits.  A foreign army would tend rather to boost ISIS recruiting as a reaction, while the Iraqi army lacks the commitment that could enable it to win.  06 September 2014 (Children facing physical violence)  60% of the world's children face regular physical violence, in many cases from their parents.  06 September 2014 (Israel plans more houses in colonies)  Israel has announced plans for 300 more houses in its colonies in Palestinian territory.  06 September 2014 (Data brokers)  A new data broker offers to pay people directly for their personal data.  Datacoup's existence by itself will not eliminate ordinary data brokers; something more is required. Supposing that something more appears, and other data brokers disappear, how much better will this be?  I would not give any data to the services that Datacoup works with. In fact, the only one of them I might consider using is Twitter, precisely because one doesn't have to give real personal data to it.  Therefore, I would not be interested in making such data available for a mere $10 or $100 or $1000 a month.  06 September 2014 (Policies that keep poor people out)  US inner-ring suburbs such as Ferguson are full of blacks, partly because other suburban towns have adopted policies to keep poor people out.  Zoning laws are a big source of injustice, and play a major role in the high cost of renting housing in the US. I think we need to invalidate some aspects of zoning laws in a broad fashion.  06 September 2014 (Using TTIP to bully the EU)  The TTIP is providing an excuse for companies to bully the EU to accept GMO food imports.  Modern free exploitation treaties, since the one that created the WTO, are harmful by nature. Politicians that endorse the project of making a new free exploitation treaties have their hearts in the wrong place.  06 September 2014 (Fads for unusual pets)  Movies trigger fads for unusual pets, which get abandoned by the dozens or hundreds a few years later.  05 September 2014 (Activists protesting thug militarization conference)  Activists in Oakland and San Francisco are protesting the "Urban Shield" thug militarization conference.  05 September 2014 (Revitalizing the union movement)  Fast-food strikes are revitalizing the union movement in the US.  05 September 2014 (Russian TV Shows Funeral of Soldier Killed 'On Leave')  Russian TV Shows Funeral of Soldier Killed 'On Leave' in Ukraine.  05 September 2014 (Lessons to draw from the Ashya King case)  Lessons to draw from the Ashya King case.  05 September 2014 (Torture)  A country can't admit torture was committed and then fail to do anything about it. Unless it is ruled by the Obama regime.  05 September 2014 (Accused of Promoting Feminist Views)  Iranian Women's Magazine Editor Accused of Promoting Feminist Views.  05 September 2014 (Fighting ISIS by making it look ridiculous)  Fighting ISIS by making it look ridiculous.  The Arab World's Version of the Ice Bucket Challenge: Burning ISIS Flags.  05 September 2014 (Human rights activists disappeared by gov't)  Human rights activists investigating enslavement of workers in Qatar appear to have been disappeared by the government.  05 September 2014 (Cradle-To-Prison pipeline)  The downtrodden parts of the US systematically direct youth into prison, but some forms of aid have shown they can break the cradle-to-prison pipeline.  We also have an obligation to end the systems that constitute the pipeline: running the economy to keep most Americans poor, racist thugs, the War on Drugs, and thugs in schools shoving students into the school-to-prison pipeline.  05 September 2014 (Seattle activists blocked a train line)  Seattle activists blocked a train line to protest the transport of oil by train through their state.  05 September 2014 (Refuges for women experiencing domestic violence)  Refuges for women experiencing domestic violence are necessary so they don't have to stay with their abusers.  Closing them down is part of the right-wing "family values" agenda, which values compelling people to be in families rather than the people as people.  05 September 2014 (Global heating and the plutocratic world order)  Naomi Klein: global heating and the plutocratic world order are hitting the world at the same time. This means either disaster or perhaps opportunity.  The plutocrats will seek to use the effects of global heating for shock capitalism, so as to drive most people in developed world into desperation such as we haven't seen since the 1930s. If ending plutocratic rule is necessary to avoid disaster, maybe that will spur people to do it  Naomi, please don't call the plutocrats and their supporters "Liberals". A Liberal is someone like me, or (to cite a leader of Liberals) someone like FDR.  05 September 2014 (Hamid Kehazaei was apparently killed by Australia)  Asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei was apparently killed by Australia, which sent him to an offshore prison in which prisoners got bad and delayed medical treatment.  05 September 2014 (Ukraine and Russia-lead rebels agreed to cease-fire)  Ukraine and Russia-lead rebels have agreed to a cease-fire.  The defeats suffered by Ukraine's forces, after weeks of slowly gaining, seem to prove by themselves that Russia gave the rebels armor, if not troops as well. Therefore, I don't think Putin is willing to let the matter end here.  05 September 2014 (BP guilty of "gross negligence")  Billionaire Polluters will have to pay Billions in Penalties after a judge ruled BP guilty of "gross negligence" in the Big Spill.  05 September 2014 (Abott the suppository of false promises)  Abbott continued right up to the Australian election a year ago being the suppository of false promises.  05 September 2014 (Stopping the Ebola outbreak)  Stopping the Ebola outbreak will cost half a billion dollars and take up to 9 months.  That's if we commit the resources now.  05 September 2014 (Let Down By the Law)  Ashya King Case Shows How Parents Can Be Let Down by the Law.  05 September 2014 (Dalai Lama barred from South Africa)  South Africa barred entry to the Dalai Lama &mdash; again.  05 September 2014 ("Playable city")  The idea of a "playable city".  05 September 2014 (Practices of Ferguson thugs)  The US government will investigate the practices of Ferguson thugs, in general as well as relating to the killing of Michael Brown.  In Ferguson, if you're black and not rich, simply driving is enough to get you fined over and over, and jailed because you can't pay.  05 September 2014 (Violation by Koch-funded organization)  A Koch-funded organization appears to have violated IRS regulations on electioneering in 2012.  Will Obama and Holder bestir themselves to have this investigated?  05 September 2014 (Pennsylvania facilitating fracking)  Pennsylvania, to facilitate fracking, has gutted its inspection system and rushed the approval of projects.  05 September 2014 (Google's support for ALEC)  50 organizations have called on Google to stop supporting ALEC.  Google claims its motto is "Don't be evil", but there is little in US politics that is more evil than ALEC.  05 September 2014 (Urgent: Reverse the Citizens United decision)  US citizens: phone your senators to urge them to vote for the constitutional amendment to reverse the Citizens United decision.  Although the amendment being considered is narrow,and won't abolish the idea that corporations are entitled to human rights, it is important nonetheless. The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  05 September 2014 (Living from paycheck to paycheck)  75% of Americans are living from paycheck to paycheck, unable to save any money.  14% have had trouble getting food at some time in the past year.  03 September 2014 (Evidence of Russian troops in Ukraine)  Some US intelligence whistleblowers say they distrust the claim that Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine.  Here is the evidence I've seen that Russia has sent troops to fight in Ukraine.  It does not all come from the US or NATO.  03 September 2014 (Rich spending more on election)  Due to the Supreme Court's "rich people's money is speech" McCutcheon decision, 300 rich people have already spent 11 million dollars more on this year's election than previous limits permitted.  03 September 2014 (Tories try to hamstring charities)  The Tories are trying to hamstring organizations such as Oxfam so they cannot campaign for hungry people there.  03 September 2014 (Spread of phony abortion counsellors)  Phony abortion counsellors that give false information have spread from the US to Australia.  03 September 2014 (Greenpeace India funding)  The Indian government blocked foreign funding for Greenpeace India, but a court reversed the decision.  Evidently Modi's government wants mining companies to trash India.  03 September 2014 (CVS discontinuing sale of cigarettes)  CVS is discontinuing sale of cigarettes.  03 September 2014 (Lobbying against GM labelling)  Opponents of GM Labelling Triple Lobbying Spending in 2014.  03 September 2014 (Worse off today than under Dubya)  In a Lot of Ways, We're Worse Off Today Than We Were under George W. Bush.  03 September 2014 (Gulf of Maine hit by global heating)  Global heating is hitting the Gulf of Maine hard, driving many species northward.  03 September 2014 (Prison next to coal ash dump)  Pennsylvania put a prison next to a coal ash dump, and the prisoners are getting diseases from that.  03 September 2014 (Great Barrier Reef still threatened)  Australia has been pressured into cancelling the plan to dump waste from dredging a new coal port straight into the Great Barrier Reef. However, the export of coal from that port will still gravely threaten the reef.  03 September 2014 (What AT&amp;T wants)  AT&amp;T Wants Tax Incentives And State Laws That Protect It from Competition.  Since cables running down the street are a natural monopoly, they should be be owned either by tightly regulated businesses or directly by the state.  03 September 2014 (Commenting on a candidate's appearance)  Commenting on a female candidate's appearance, whether positively or negatively or neutrally, tends to harm the candidate's success in the race. Pointing out that this is a side issue, and what matters is the candidate's politics, cancels out that effect.  In this context, it is interesting to note the way other senators commented disparagingly on the appearance of Senator Gillibrand.  03 September 2014 ("Fast food" staff strike)  Staff in "fast food" restaurants in several US states plan to go on strike on Sep 4 and protest outside restaurants.  Remember that "fast food" was not supposed to be eaten. It was originally intended for fasting.  04 September 2014 (ISIS getting desperate)  ISIS published another beheading video.  ISIS is really desperate to get the US more involved in fighting.  04 September 2014 (Therapy of LSD)  How conservative prejudice cut off the promising therapy of LSD.  04 September 2014 (Help block a pipeline for fracked gas)  Citizens of New York State, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts: help block a pipeline for fracked gas.  04 September 2014 (Israel sabotaged the Palestinian Authority)  Israel sabotaged the Palestinian Authority by not passing on the tax revenues it collects on the PA's behalf.  04 September 2014 (UK thugs secretly checked a journalist's phone records)  UK thugs secretly checked a journalist's phone records without a warrant.  This was to identify a whistleblower in the thug department.  The thugs refuse to say how many times they have done this.  04 September 2014 (Tax dodging and corruption)  Tax dodging and corruption cost the world's poorest countries 20 billion dollars in tax revenue, or maybe more if the tax rate were what it should be.  The US government (and US citizens) suffer from this too.  03 September 2014 (Tasmania has permitted logging)  Tasmania has permitted logging in 1500 square miles of currently protected forests.  They claim that this is justified by "creating jobs", which is standard bullshit for right-wing governments that decide to loot the environment. (The same has been said to argue for the Keystone XL pipeline.) Of course, the same right-wing governments destroy far more jobs through austerity. Take away a lot, give back a little while screwing you, and say you should be grateful.  I do not consider trees sacred. If most of the Earth's wild forests were still here, it would make sense to cut parts of them, just not too much. But we've already come close to wiping out many ecosystems, and now it is time to stop.  As we get closer to catastrophe, the money pressure attacking every protected area or possible resource will grow. The plutocrats who hope to profit will promise trickle-down to some of the masses they have made desperate, so as to get them to support the looting. By the time civilization can no longer support the sort of trade that makes it profitable to cut down forests and ship the wood across the world, we may have wiped out every last bit of forest in the final frenzy.  Mining threatens to poison the Scandinavian Arctic.  03 September 2014 (Questions North Carolina thugs must answer)  Five questions North Carolina thugs must answer about the two teenagers they framed for murder.  03 September 2014 (Judge rejects release of torture photos)  A judge rejected release of photos of Mohammed al-Qahtani, because seeing how he was tortured might make people angry at the US.  Wouldn't all criminals love to be able to use that argument.  03 September 2014 (EU requiring better energy efficiency)  The EU is requiring improved efficiency from electric appliances, and right-wing media are trying to make a scandal out of it.  03 September 2014 (TTIP would ban undoing privatization of NHS)  The UK government has had to admit that that the TTIP would ban undoing the privatization of the NHS. Its whole purpose is to put companies over the public.  Is there any major party in the UK that opposes the TTIP? Please tell me if you know.  03 September 2014 (Global heating tied to droughts)  Advances in climate modelling have tied global heating to long droughts including the current drought in California.  03 September 2014 (Uber banned in Germany)  In Germany, Uber has been renamed Unter: it is banned. However, not for the sake of passengers' privacy.  03 September 2014 (False murder convictions)  Two convicted murderers in North Carolina may be freed now that DNA evidence shows the real killer was someone else.  The thugs bullied the teenagers into confessing, then hid evidence that would have proved their innocence. Egregiously, the thugs seem to have actively blocked investigation of the real killer at the time. (Don't let inconvenient facts get in the way of the preferred theory.)  It's as if the thugs were out to get those two teenagers, but why? I don't know, but I can guess a possible explanation. Is it possible that the teenagers were black and the real murderer was white?  Will the detectives that committed this vicious act be put on trial?  03 September 2014 (Curbing long-term global heating)  Some policies to reduce long-term global heating can increase short-term global heating. This is because they reduce CO2 emissions but increase methane emissions.  This issue becomes important if humanity gets its act together to reduce CO2 emissions enough to curb long-term global heating. If humanity fails to do so, as now appears likely, then this issue will only slightly change the timing of disaster.  03 September 2014 (Traffic ticket quota in Florida)  A few Florida thugs listened to their consciences and reported that their chief was illegally giving them a quota for traffic tickets.  Will the chief be prosecuted? Will the tickets be refunded and the license points taken off?  03 September 2014 (Global heating disaster meeting)  India and China have announced they will downgrade their participation in the last-ditch meeting to try to avoid global heating disaster.  03 September 2014 (Increased racism in Israel)  A Palestinian citizen of Israel, well accustomed to second-class citizenship, reports on the wave of increased racism and repression.  Widely repeated death threats against Arabs go unchecked, while Arabs that make sober criticism of war get fired or arrested.  03 September 2014 (Boycott of Israeli products)  The boycott of Israeli products is getting strong enough to make Israeli businesses pressure the government.  03 September 2014 (Urgent: Pass the Voting Rights Amendments Act)  US citizens: Call on Congress to pass the Voting Rights Amendments Act.  03 September 2014 (The winners and the losers of the latest battle in Gaza)  The winners and the losers of the latest battle in Gaza.  03 September 2014 (Israeli soldier shot Palestinian teenager in the head)  An Israeli soldier shot a Palestinian teenager in the head with a rubber-coated steel bullet, fracturing his skull.  This does not happen by accident: the soldiers are good shots, and the teenager was not expecting violence, so he was probably walking in a steady, predictable way.  03 September 2014 (Israeli army used Palestinian civilian as human shield)  The Israeli army took a Palestinian civilian hostage, then used him as a human shield, forcing him to search buildings for tunnels.  Israel repeatedly accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields but there is no evidence this ever occurred.  03 September 2014 (Collusion and lying among thugs)  The UK has exposed collusion and lying among the thugs that accused an important Tory politician of calling them "fucking plebs".  Such collusion and lying is commonplace among thugs, to cover up other nasty things such as killing an innocent person. The system is set up to take it for truth &mdash; unless the victim is an important right-wing politician.  03 September 2014 (Barcelona faces an excess of tourism)  Barcelona faces the problem of an excess of tourism, which threatens to force the residents out of the city, as a local consequence of broader problems: corruption and the debt-collecting government of occupation.  03 September 2014 (Health systems have collapsed in West Africa)  Medecins Sans Frontieres says military medical teams are needed in West Africa because health systems have collapsed. Infectious corpses are rotting in the streets and treatable diseases are killing people.  The absence of medical care could kill a lot more people than Ebola is killing now. The panic could become worse than a civil war.  Liberian nurses have gone on strike because they don't have proper equipment to protect them from catching Ebola from their patients.  Shouldn't the US donate this equipment?  03 September 2014 (Collapse into global poverty)  40 years later, data vindicate the Limits to Growth study, suggesting that civilization is nearing the start of a collapse into global poverty.  02 September 2014 (Easing Restrictions on Gaza)  Easing Restrictions on Gaza Won't Create Conditions for Normal Life Or Offer Any Economic Or Diplomatic Horizon.  02 September 2014 (Governor Walker target of campaign violations investigation)  Proof that Wisconsin Governor Walker is indeed a target of the campaign violations investigation that a crony judge has halted.  02 September 2014 (Urgent: Employee Empowerment Act)  US citizens: call on Congress to pass the Employee Empowerment Act, which would make it illegal to discriminate against employees for trying to organize a union.  02 September 2014 (Neural modulators)  The US is developing tiny neural modulators as implants to modify the function of particular nerves in the brain.  I am suspicious of the idea of using this to treat arthritis. Arthritis is not a brain condition; it is a disorder of joints. A neural modulator might alter the sensation of pain from arthritis but that would not make the joint any better. It might over time do just the opposite.  02 September 2014 (Smoothing the way for mining projects)  Ahead of proposing mining projects in northern Australia, the Australian government is cutting funds for monitoring environmental damage there.  02 September 2014 (Weather forecasts for 2050)  Sample weather forecasts for 2050 might show people what global heating means in practice.  Remember that 2100 will be much worse than 2050.  Our reality resembles the film, The Day the Earth Caught Fire, though not at the same speed.  I think the writer doesn't really understand science fiction; he thinks it is supposed to be a comment on our world. As a famous critic (was it Samuel Delaney?) pointed out, people who don't really understand science fiction tend to perceive it as allegory, a comment on something else, rather than a fictional world in which the events described happen. This is the heart of science fiction.  I once heard a song on the radio that talked about birds' disappearing in the sky. What an alarming idea! I recall imagining what I'd ask if I saw that really happen. Were they being destroyed, or transported elsewhere? What's the cause &mdash; a natural phenomenon, a technological accident, a weapon? Would it get me next?  Then I realized the song did not mean it literally, only that the birds were flying off into the distance. How pedestrian! Their disappearance would have been far more interesting.  This made me realize that I have a science-fictional way of understanding a story.  02 September 2014 (UN to investigate ISIS atrocities)  The UN will try to investigate atrocities committed by ISIS, and lesser atrocities committed by the Iraqi government army.  02 September 2014 (Hong Kong legislators protest)  Hong Kong legislators protested as China's representative declared that only submissive candidates would be allowed in Hong Kong.  02 September 2014 (New Spanish Pun)  New pun  anteojos para dormir.  02 September 2014 (Urgent: Pay workers a living wage)  Everyone: call on Dunkin Donuts to pay workers a living wage.  02 September 2014 (Farm guards acquitted of shooting Bangladeshi farm workers)  Farm guards in Greece were acquitted, incredibly, of shooting Bangladeshi farm workers who were protesting that they had been denied their pay.  The farmer owners exploit these migrant workers rather than pay a Greek worker decent wages. I would support the Greek government completely in deporting the migrant workers &mdash; and prosecuting the farmers for hiring them. But that is no justification for denying them their pay, let alone for shooting them.  02 September 2014 (Urgent: End to funding militarization of thugs)  US citizens: call for an end to funding militarization of thugs.  02 September 2014 (Madly overzealous UK thugs)  Madly overzealous UK thugs had the King family arrested in Spain for taking their sick child out of a hospital, hoping to give him a different treatment elsewhere.  It appears doctors disagree about whether the proton beam treatment they hope to give Ashya King might help him. (See the end of the article.) In any case, the hospital he was in had given up hope for saving him, so there was nothing to lose by trying another treatment except what it would cost.  The hospitals that say the proton beam treatment is better might have been exaggerating to get business. Or it might be true.  Whether it is true or not, whether it saves Ashya King or not, it is clear that his parents were acting responsibly to try to care for him. The accusations of neglect, used to get them arrested in Spain, are impossible to justify.  It appears that the European arrest warrant was issued without a valid legal basis.  02 September 2014 (Coal mining licenses in India)  Modi's government wants to preserve some of the coal mining licenses that were issued corruptly.  Even if a mine is ready to produce, that is no obstacle to requiring the mine license to be auctioned properly to buyers.  There is also the separate and vital environmental issue of whether India ought to burn so much coal.  02 September 2014 (Thousands of Russian soldiers sent to places near Ukraine)  Thousands of Russian soldiers were sent to places near Ukraine, then stopped communicating with their families.  Hundreds have turned up killed in combat, and the government refuses to say where they died.  The only plausible explanation is that they have been sent into Ukraine to fight.  I find it amusing that people who (rightly) distrust what the US government says about its own military operations are willing to believe what Putin says about his.  02 September 2014 (Don't blame low-paid working mothers)  Don't blame low-paid working mothers for bringing along children to help.  Instead, blame the cruel right-wing politicians that make laws that make this the best option those mothers have available.  02 September 2014 (Urgent: Call on Dole to intervene to protect Andy Hall)  Everyone: call on Dole to intervene to protect Andy Hall, who reported on slavery in pineapple production in Thailand.  Here is more information.  01 September 2014 (Urgent: An excuse to avoid punishment for rape)  Everyone: call on Algeria and Tunisia to stop accepting marriage as an excuse to avoid punishment for rape.  01 September 2014 (Erdogan has continued to arrest Turkish thugs)  Erdogan has continued to arrest the Turkish thugs that are connected with trying to prosecute ministers for corruption.  01 September 2014 (Seizure of land near Bethlehem)  The US rebuked Israel for seizing Palestinian land near Bethlehem.  Israel admits that this seizure of land is meant as a collective punishment of Palestinians for a crime they have nothing to do with.  01 September 2014 (Dehumanization by Israeli society)  Israeli society is increasingly flooded with dehumanization of Palestinians and threats/advocacy of sexual violence.  01 September 2014 (Pentagon cover-ups)  The Pentagon has repeatedly covered up flaws in its weapons, flaws that kill US troops, and punishes the whistleblowers that reveal them.  01 September 2014 (ISIS and al-Nusra's funding)  ISIS and al-Nusra continue to get lots of funding from people in Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  Those states may not be funding them directly, but they permit it to go on.  01 September 2014 (Urgent: Call on the Vatican to divest from fossil fuels)  Everyone: call on the Vatican to divest from fossil fuels.  01 September 2014 (Urgent: Your candidates on abortion rights)  Massachusetts citizens: see how your candidates stand on abortion rights.  01 September 2014 (Bill requiring students to explicitly ask for sex before doing so)  California is about to pass a bill that in effect requires college students to explicitly ask "Do you want to have sex?" before doing so.  The article does not make it clear that this law will regulate how colleges handle accusations of sexual assault &mdash; not students directly.  However, it is so common for people to have sex without explicitly asking each other "Do you want to have sex now?" that I fear students will consider the requirement for "affirmative consent" ridiculous, and systematically ignore it, so that they will nearly all be technically guilty if the school ever investigates them.  Another point in the article, which makes the law seem unreasonable in a different way, describes it wrong. The law does not say that consent is invalid if "given under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs", as the article put it. Those words would seem to mean that if two people meet after drinking alcohol, and then have sex, then neither of them really consented &mdash; if the law said that. But the law really says that a person who is "incapacitated" by alcohol and/or drugs does not consent. That seems correct to me.  01 September 2014 (Systematic harassment of the poor)  The high rate of arrest warrants in Ferguson &mdash; more than 1.5 per year per inhabitant &mdash; is due to systematic harassment of the poor.  This is common across the US, and amounts to an additional tax on the consequences of poverty.  01 September 2014 (Thousands protested in Australia)  Thousands in Australia protested Abbott's war on children and young people.  01 September 2014 (Decline of wild salmon wiping out orcas)  The decline of wild salmon populations is slowly wiping out the orcas of Puget Sound.  01 September 2014 (Munitions that reduce the environmental damage of war)  Designing munitions that reduce the environmental damage of war.  This is the opposite of depleted uranium munitions.  01 September 2014 (Hong Kong citizens plan a massive protest)  Hong Kong citizens plan a massive protest after China rejected free elections in Hong Kong.  01 September 2014 (Babies are born at the 23rd week of pregnancy)  When babies are born at the 23rd week of pregnancy, out of those that survive, almost 90% will have a disability. Often very serious.  I think that implies a moral duty to abort these fetuses rather than let them become disabled babies.  01 September 2014 (Britain Accused of Conniving at Torture)  Britain Accused of Conniving at Torture of Maoists in Nepal's Civil War.  01 September 2014 (Islamist army terrifying residents)  The Islamist army that conquered Tripoli is also tied to particular Libyan tribes, and is terrifying residents connected with tribes it considers enemies.  01 September 2014 (NYT endorses not punishing killer thugs)  The New York Times endorses bending over backwards not to punish killer thugs.  The impunity is so complete that exceptions are very rare.  31 August 2014 (Microsoft dodging taxes)  Microsoft is playing the offshore game to dodge lots of taxes.  31 August 2014 (Australian man rejects Australian state)  An Australian of aboriginal origin has rejected the Australian state, its money, its passport, etc., as a symbolic act.  31 August 2014 (America's Real Foreign Policy)  Noam Chomsky: America's Real Foreign Policy.  It aims for security for state and plutocratic power, not for citizens.  31 August 2014 (Imposed poverty in the UK)  Imposed poverty in the UK has reached the point where children suffer from rickets, which is caused by a shortage of minerals or of vitamin D.  Vitamin D is made in the skin when it's exposed to sunlight, but the minerals must come from food.  31 August 2014 (Pacific Islands drowning)  The Pacific Islands Are Drowning, We Need the World's Help.  31 August 2014 (TTIP treaty back door)  The proposed TTIP treaty has a back door which could be used, afterwards, to cancel out food safety inspection.  31 August 2014 (Overloading the Earth)  Even though economic growth is no longer tied strictly to energy use increases, many human activities are pushing absolute resource limits.  Of course, our current way of doing things is not sustainable. But ceasing to overload the Earth does not inevitably mean we must be poor and deprived. That depends on whether the plutocrats take it all.  31 August 2014 (Court orders censorship of app)  A Brazilian court ordered Apple, Google and Microsoft to delete the Secret app (and a similar one) from their app stores.  Nobody should use that app; it is proprietary software, so the users don't control it and it may well be malware (as many proprietary programs are).  The Apple and Microsoft operating systems are proprietary and full of malware, too, as is Google Play which is part of Android.  Notwithstanding that, this court decision is oppression, pure and simple. But what makes the decision so damaging is that Apple and Microsoft have built censorship of apps into their operating systems. Now Brazil is using their censorship systems for its own purposes.  31 August 2014 (Power of the UK establishment)  In 1950, the UK establishment confronted democracy to maintain its power. Nowadays, it has achieved such superiority over democracy that there is nothing to restrain its power.  In the US, the confrontation dated from 1932 to 1980, and some details of the establishment are different, but the result is the same.  This is why none of the major parties proposes measures that would give poor Britons decent housing.  31 August 2014 (ISIS)  Kerry called for a "global coalition" to fight ISIS.  Fighting ISIS in a way that is effective in the long term is not such a simple thing. Previous interventions backfired, and ISIS is the result.  Although fighting ISIS can hurt it tactically, in the long term military opposition that enrages foreign Sunnis is what ISIS thrives on.  The leaders of ISIS seem to want to encourage a big US intervention, and that is why they publish provocative videos of real or pretended beheadings.  They also want to encourage Shi'ite hatred that will frighten Iraqi Sunnis.  31 August 2014 (GMOs get Clinton's full support)  Hillary Clinton went to a GMO convention and gave GMOs her full support, repeating the false talking points of the GMO companies.  30 August 2014 (Urgent: Vermont's GMO labeling law)  In the US: petition major organic dairies to drop out of the organization that is supporting the lawsuit to overturn Vermont's GMO labeling law.  30 August 2014 (Expressions of emotion)  Women report that men's verbal confrontation is occasionally followed by their physical aggression, often enough that the verbal confrontation makes them scared physical aggression will follow.  I don't understand those men's attitude towards women. It seems to be a mixture of desire, hatred and contempt. I have never felt that way towards anyone, but I am compelled by women's testimony to believe that some men do.  Nonetheless, expressions of emotion are not physical attacks. The two are not morally equivalent. If some insults lead to an assault, that doesn't mean an insult is as bad as an assault.  30 August 2014 (The War for Nothing)  Uri Avnery: The War for Nothing.  It is interesting that the rockets fired from Hamas, although they rarely injure a person, made life so unpleasant in the farms near the border of Gaza that people began to move away.  Israel has no right to order Gazans to stay away from the border on pain of being shot without warning. Israel does have the right to evacuate the land on its own side of the border. If Israel wants a buffer zone, that is the legitimate way to make one.  30 August 2014 (Prison sentence for redistributing movie)  A UK man was sentenced to about 3 years in prison for redistributing copies of a movie.  Someone pointed out that this is as much as the usual penalty for convicted rapists.  This redistribution was done commercially. I don't advocate legalization of commercial redistribution of copyrighted works without authorization. Works made to be used in a practical way should all be free but this was a work of fiction, not a functional work. So I don't think what Danks did has to be legalized.  However, the companies that the UK government caters to would have told it to jail him just the same if he had not tried to make one penny.  Please don't refer to unauthorized copying with the smear term, "piracy". Movie piracy is what you see in Captain Blood.  30 August 2014 (Foolish American overreactions)  Most Americans want it to be illegal to allow children to play outside alone.  This shows how far the American insanity about children has gone.  Another foolish overreaction: a foreign tourist who climbed a tower on the Brooklyn Bridge faces criminal charges. He is likely to be jailed for years before trial.  30 August 2014 (Canadian scientists silenced)  Canadian scientists are required to get 9 levels of approval before they can tell the public how much Arctic ice has melted.  30 August 2014 (Thugs knowingly jail wrong person)  The thugs knew Shannon Renee McNeal was the wrong person, and so did the court, but they insisted on jailing her anyway.  Anyone can make a mistake, but there should be zero tolerance for insisting on mistreating someone based on a mistake that has been recognized. All the people who did so should be fired.  30 August 2014 (Legalized medical marijuana)  States which had legalized medical marijuana, in 2010, had significantly fewer deaths from opioid pain-killers.  30 August 2014 (Money for Mugabe's terror campaign)  A US hedge fund appears to have given Mugabe the money for his terror campaign that undid the opposition's electoral victory.  30 August 2014 (Texas thug kills teenager)  A thug in Texas killed a teenager who reasonably thought the thug was an armed thief and tried to drive away. The thug faces no charges.  30 August 2014 (Executive Order 12333)  An executive order made by President Reagan, which ostensibly allows spying on foreigners, is used today mainly to collect data about Americans.  The article repeats the absurd nostrum that terrorists such as al Qa'ida threatened the existence of the US. This is a ridiculous exaggeration &mdash; what they could directly do was too small to eliminate the US, and the only way they could do great harm was if the US reacted self-destructively (which it did). Since this ridiculous exaggeration was the excuse for Dubya's attacks on US human rights, and on Iraq, we must not let it pass as true. We must refute it even when someone else mentions it only in passing.  President Reagan's other horrible things: He betrayed his country by supplying weapons to terrorists as ransom for the hostages they had taken. He attacked the non-rich, setting the US on the path towards today's plutocracy and expanding poverty.  30 August 2014 (Republican loyalty to money)  Republican candidates for the senate met with rich donors and confessed their undying gratitude and loyalty to the money.  30 August 2014 (Urgent: End corporate tax write-offs)  US citizens: call for an end to tax write-offs on penalties to corporations.  30 August 2014 (US thugs plan to deploy drones)  Many US thug departments are planning to deploy drones, perhaps with infrared cameras to see what the eye could not (such as, whether someone is home).  We certainly can't trust thugs to follow rules, or laws.  30 August 2014 (Social networks silence dissenters)  Some major social networks tend to silence a dissenting few, on any issue.  This is why it helps us greatly if you insist on calling the GNU/Linux system "GNU/Linux" and refuse to be intimidated by those who erroneously call it "Linux".  30 August 2014 (Pakistani TV station driven off air)  Intimidation by Imran Khan's opposition party is driving a Pakistani TV station mostly off the air.  30 August 2014 (Investigation of war crimes in Gaza)  The ICC says that it can investigate war crimes in Gaza if it gets a request from the government of Palestine.  I don't know whether it really needs that request or is passing the buck. I am sure the US is putting pressure on Palestine not to give the ICC jurisdiction.  30 August 2014 (ISIS uses waterboarding)  ISIS uses waterboarding on prisoners, following the US example.  30 August 2014 (Overestimation of terrorism danger)  Intelligence agencies have every reason to overestimate the danger of terrorism.  Not to mention that it provides an excuse to do to us what they want to do anyway: spy on everyone's communications and movements.  30 August 2014 (Ferguson thug department sued)  Ferguson protesters and bystanders attacked by thugs have sued the thug department for 40 million dollars.  I hope they win, but if they do, they will only get compensation from the city. The guilty won't be punished.  30 August 2014 (Urgent: Ditch ALEC)  US citizens: call on state officials to ditch ALEC.  30 August 2014 (US political "debate" shows)  On US TV, the political "debate" shows don't invite, or even mention, union leaders.  30 August 2014 (The libertarian ideology)  The libertarian ideology stubbornly opposes all solutions to problems such as public health and global heating.  30 August 2014 (US sanctions against Iran)  US sanctions against Iran continue to make necessary medicines unavailable there.  30 August 2014 (UK says Russia sent 80 tanks and lots of soldiers into Ukraine)  The UK says that Russia has sent 80 tanks and lots of soldiers into Ukraine.  30 August 2014 (Hong Kong has launched accusations of bribery)  Hong Kong has launched accusations of bribery against a media mogul that campaigns for democracy.  30 August 2014 (Plutocrats want socialism for them)  Plutocrats want the benefits of socialism for them, plus "small government" to strand the rest of us.  30 August 2014 (Number of manatees in Florida has increased greatly)  The number of manatees in Florida has increased greatly since they were protected, so the question is whether to designate them as "threatened" rather than "endangered".  A species can't survive if its habitat is wiped out. The US often protects one endearing endangered species as a way of protecting the whole ecosystem, including many other species, that it lives in. It seems that manatees are an example of this. The existing restrictions enable manatees to coexist with human water activities, but this redesignation would permit land development that could wipe out all of them.  30 August 2014 (E-Cigarettes Should Be Called 'Nicotine Sticks')  E-Cigarettes Should Be Called 'Nicotine Sticks' to Curb Appeal, Experts Say.  I suggest calling them "nicotine inhalers" and designing them to look like the inhalers for other drugs &mdash; totally un-cool.  29 August 2014 (Urgent: Oppose support for Monsanto)  US citizens: tell Hillary Clinton to stop supporting Monsanto and GMOs.  29 August 2014 (UN peacekeepers taken hostage)  Syrian rebels have taken UN peacekeepers hostage.  29 August 2014 (GMO industry trying to silence criticism)  The GMO industry is trying to get Reuters journalist Carey Gillam fired or transferred, part of a general pattern of trying to silence criticism.  29 August 2014 (Brain-eating amoeba)  Due to global heating, a brain-eating amoeba is spreading north from Louisiana.  Getting just one in your nose can be fatal.  29 August 2014 (Senate's torture investigation report)  Victims of US-managed kidnaping and torture call on Obama to release the Senate's torture investigation report.  29 August 2014 (Captured soldiers killed by ISIS)  ISIS killed 200 Syrian soldiers that it had captured, according to its supporters.  Even supposing the report is inaccurate, it shows what ISIS would like to do.  29 August 2014 (Prohibition on cohabitation overturned)  A prohibition on cohabitation, effectively Mormon polygamous marriages though not saying so, has been overturned in a court.  There is a secular polyamory community, which I support. We believe that polyamorous relationships are legitimate; we know they can be happy, and don't lead particularly to problems. I see no valid grounds for the prohibition that was just overturned.  However, the critics of Mormon polygamy say it is a system of oppression of women and children. Are they right? If so, how can those facts be reconciled with secular polyamorous experience? Are these relationships bad in a hidden way? Is there a crucial difference, that causes secular polyamory to have better results than Mormon ones? Is it a matter of different ways of judging whether a relationship is good or bad?  29 August 2014 (Warren on Israel's occupation)  Elizabeth Warren is right wing in regard to Israel's occupation of Palestine.  29 August 2014 (Export peace to Gaza)  Muslim and Jewish leaders in Britain say, let's export peace to Gaza.  29 August 2014 (Australia's spending on energy)  Australia's next offensive for the fossil fuel companies is to eliminate new spending on conversion to renewable energy.  29 August 2014 (Market Basket's old CEO returns)  Market Basket's old CEO, that customers and workers supported, has returned.  29 August 2014 (Estimated emissions from Keystone XL)  How the US government's basic error leads to underestimating the CO2 emissions from Keystone XL.  29 August 2014 (Renewable energy)  Renewable energy now generates 22% of electricity, but politicians are working hard to slow the growth rate.  When you compare the cost of renewable energy subsidies with the damage global heating will do, the former is clearly less. It's also much less than the fossil fuel subsidies, which the same politicians don't complain about. Clearly that cost is not the real reason.  I think the reason for this is fossil fuel company money.  29 August 2014 (Stepping on the downtrodden)  The Australian government's next excuse to step on the downtrodden: punishing those who miss a job interview.  29 August 2014 (Putin's covert war of conquest)  The Ukrainian army says that the Russian army has invaded and is attacking the city of Mariupol, after weeks of bombardment from Russian territory.  It appears that Putin has decided on a real covert war of conquest, not the provocation/distraction from Crimea that I thought this was.  29 August 2014 (Safety advice and victim-blaming)  Not all safety advice constitutes victim-blaming.  29 August 2014 (Whether to intervene in Iraq)  The question of whether to intervene in Iraq includes questions about what sort of intervention it would be, and with what goal.  29 August 2014 (Obama regimes' obedience to banksters)  The Obama regime, obedient to the banksters as usual, fined Goldman Sachs for fraud, but will allow Goldman Sachs to deduct the fine from its taxes and recover 1/3 of it.  29 August 2014 (Shaker Aamer beaten for protesting)  Shaker Aamer, held without charges in Guantanamo, is now being beaten daily by the guards as punishment for protesting his imprisonment.  29 August 2014 (US not obligated to fight in Syria)  Suggestion: the US has no more obligation to fight Assad in Syria than it has to fight the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, etc.  When Assad faced a campaign of peaceful protests for human rights, that campaign merited support on ethical grounds. Today's situation is totally different.  When a violent uprising started in parallel with that campaign, Assad said it was started by Islamists, and that may have been true. Once the fighting started, various Sunni groups, reportedly less fanatical, joined in; but they have been eclipsed by the jihadi groups funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  That the US does not have to fight all these dictators does not mean it must or should give them strong support, as it does now.  The reasons the US government has stated for supporting so many Arab dictators and monarchs are: to oppose the Soviet Union (obsolete), and to promote stability. Ironically, this practice has had the effect, across decades, of enabling Islamist fanatics to win the support of those who oppose the dictators and monarchs for other reasons.  29 August 2014 (The cease-fire in Gaza)  The indefinite cease-fire in Gaza includes some relaxation of the siege, but not entirely.  29 August 2014 (UK thugs' priorities)  The UK thugs didn't bother investigating the murder of Ricky Reel, apparently for racist motives, because they were too busy investigating his family as they campaigned for a proper investigation of the murder.  29 August 2014 (Universities)  Universities were once considered a way to benefit society by spreading learning and giving the non-rich a path to advance; now they mainly maintain the elite status quo.  29 August 2014 (Rate of killing by US thugs)  The US equivalent of Iraq Body Count has found that US thugs kill about 3 times as many people as the FBI reports &mdash; around 1100 a year.  29 August 2014 (War on drugs in Australia)  In an Australian state, one party proposes to escalate the war on drugs.  I think it is a bad idea to use methamphetamine, but the war on drugs does worse harm than the drugs.  29 August 2014 (New coal electric plants in Europe)  New coal-fired electric plants in Europe threatens to wipe out all its savings in CO2 emissions.  If solar power and more advanced batteries catch on, these plants will be lost investments. I suspect that the owners are getting a subsidy to build them, or a loan from the state that will never be repaid if the plants become unnecessary.  29 August 2014 (Urgent: Call on Burger King to drop tax dodging plan)  Everyone: call on Burger King to drop its tax dodging plan.  29 August 2014 (Urgent: Call for protection of monarch butterflies)  US citizens: call for protection of monarch butterflies, whose numbers have fallen by 90%.  Please don't distort the formerly useful word "decimate". It means killing ten percent of something. (The Romans used this as a punishment for military units that mutinied and then surrendered.) What we have done to the monarch butterflies is far worse than decimation.  29 August 2014 (Ban on GMOs in Kaua'i overturned)  The ban on GMOs in Kaua'i was overturned in court.  29 August 2014 (Net neutrality is "marxist")  A Koch brothers front group claims that net neutrality is "marxist".  The Koch brothers figure that any absurd claim will pass for true if they get enough organizations to say it often enough.  29 August 2014 (Three Vietnamese activists jailed)  Three Vietnamese activists who protested for democracy were jailed for "obstructing traffic".  Did Vietnam bring in thugs from Ferguson? This sounds awfully like what they did to some journalists.  29 August 2014 (UN reports on the atrocities in Syria)  The UN reports on the atrocities in Syria, committed by Assad's army and by ISIS.  29 August 2014 (Years-Late apology from thug department)  Protester Ellie Mae O'Hagan, CS gas sprayed by a wild thug for no reason says that the years-late apology from the thug department is no substitute for holding thugs accountable for their actions.  29 August 2014 (The War on Sharing)  The City of London has a police force that fights the War on Sharing, illegally.  The City of London is a small part of London that acts as a political arm of the banksters. It is the enemy of democracy.  29 August 2014 (UK social mobility)  The UK has very little no social mobility. Here are some of the causes.  The situation in the US is similar overall. Social mobility has gone way down since 50 years ago.  28 August 2014 (Declared a "security risk" for having sign on car)  A security guard in Australia was declared a "security risk" for having a sign on her car that criticized the danger of coal dust.  The greatest irony is that these ports endanger the security of Australians far more than any individual could.  28 August 2014 (Australia's record-breaking summer heat)  Global heating denialists claim Australia's record-breaking summer heat is a lie.  28 August 2014 (New Spanish Pun)  New pun in spanish.  27 August 2014 (Urgent: Wasting money on unnecessary roads)  US citizens: call on the Department of Transportation to recognize that Americans drive a little less every year, and stop wasting money on unnecessary roads.  27 August 2014 (Detroit resumes water shutoffs)  Detroit has resumed disconnecting poor people from water supply.  Some people have restored their own connections. Bravo!  27 August 2014 (Oil companies endanger New Orleans)  Greg Palast: oil companies destroyed the swamp that protected New Orleans from hurricanes, and an oil company shut down the research center that tried to warn people of the danger.  27 August 2014 (IPCC report on global heating)  The IPCC reports that global heating is already a source of danger and it may be impossible to reverse.  27 August 2014 (Imprisonment for attempting abortion)  A woman in Indiana faces many years' imprisonment for taking drugs to cause an abortion.  27 August 2014 (Thyroid cancer in Fukushima youth)  Young people who were in Fukushima at the time of the meltdown show a high rate of thyroid cancer.  27 August 2014 (Bus deregulation in the UK)  Bus deregulation in the UK (outside London) resulted in high fares and bad service.  This suggests to me that buses need a subsidy, and that deregulation meant elimination of the subsidy. Does anyone know?  27 August 2014 (How the Brutalized Become Brutal)  How the Brutalized Become Brutal.  27 August 2014 (Portable phone tracking)  Countries and criminals around the world are tracking people's movements through portable phones.  This is why I don't have one.  The NSA can figure out that two people know each other by seeing that their cell phones are in close proximity.  27 August 2014 (Pipeline protesters in Michigan)  Pipeline protesters in Michigan locked themselves to trucks to block construction of an oil pipeline.  27 August 2014 (Thug attacks man in wheelchair)  A Florida thug dumped a mostly paralyzed man onto the floor by tipping his wheelchair.  This incident is unusual, both for callousness, and because the thug's superior condemned it and apologized. It is not a basis for judging thugs in general.  But I think it is the extreme manifestation of an attitude that many thugs have in a less egregious form.  27 August 2014 (AT&amp;T's campaign against net neutrality)  How AT&amp;T buys the support of grass-roots organizations for its campaign against net neutrality.  27 August 2014 (Funds raised by Wisconsin governor)  Wisconsin Governor Walker actively raised funds for supposedly independent groups that were going to use the funds to promote voting for him.  27 August 2014 (Russian soldiers in Ukraine)  Russia admitted its soldiers were in Ukraine, and reporters trying to investigate reported secret graves in Russia of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine were attacked.  27 August 2014 (Hypersonic weapons)  Hypersonic weapons now being developed by the US, China and Russia would put the world on a hair trigger and could even be mistaken for a nuclear attack.  It would be smarter to sign a treaty to ban them, but the US government generally refuses, assuming it will have the advantage.  27 August 2014 (Urgent: Phone Lisa Kershner)  Everyone: phone Lisa Kershner, General Area Manager of Oakland Marriott City Center and Oakland Convention Center, at 1-510-466-6410, and say you object to their support for the "Urban Shield" event which promotes military weapons for use on US streets and in US homes.  27 August 2014 (Spanish women protest mayor)  Spanish women are protesting a mayor who warned men that women would make false accusations of rape.  The mayor's statement combines two points which don't really fit together. The suggestion to be careful where you go at 06:00 is wise, not just for women, and not just in regard to rape. There are places in Cambridge where I hesitate to walk when it is dark or deserted, because I don't want to be robbed.  To give this advice for avoiding rape does not excuse rape, any more than giving this advice for avoiding robbery excuses robbery. Safety advice does not inherently involve blaming the victim.  But sometimes it does. In the case of that mayor, for instance. When the mayor combines safety advice with claims about unlikely false accusations of rape, it is clear that he intends to attack women and is looking for pretexts.  27 August 2014 (Participation in Israel war crimes)  Palestine calls on various countries to investigate the participation of their citizens (who are soldiers in the Israeli army) in Israel war crimes.  27 August 2014 (Dalit women face threats of attack)  Dalit women who refuse to collect toilet waste face threats of attack from higher-caste people who demand this service.  27 August 2014 (Regulation of e-cigarettes)  WHO calls for regulation of e-cigarettes.  26 August 2014 (Russian soldiers in Ukraine)  Ukraine says its army has captured Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine alongside rebels.  26 August 2014 (Israel's destruction of buildings)  Israel's total destruction of tall buildings in Gaza is an intentional collective punishment of civilians. This is proved by the fact that Israel can, and in the past did, attack particular apartments without destroying the whole building.  26 August 2014 (If Argentina surrenders)  If Argentina surrenders to the vultures, it may be forced to surrender a lot of land to foreign powers.  26 August 2014 (UK gov't fabrications)  The UK government is fabricating absurd excuses to evade responsibility for undercover thug infiltrators that formed sexual relationships with activists, much as it is fabricating absurd excuses to evade responsibility for aiding US torture.  I may shock some people by saying this, but I think that sending thugs to infiltrate nonviolent opposition movements, in the absence of a serious crime (other than the crime of protesting), is totally unacceptable for a free society even if the thugs do not have sex with them.  26 August 2014 (Current instantiation of lynching)  Thugs' shooting black people is the current instantiation of lynching.  26 August 2014 (Guilty unless proven innocent)  A prominent Tory wants to apply "guilty unless proven innocent" to anyone that goes to Syria or Iraq.  26 August 2014 (NSA database of who talks to whom)  The NSA maintains a huge database of who talks with whom, including Americans as well as foreigners, and makes it available to several government agencies for all sorts of investigations.  26 August 2014 (Khalida Jarrar exiled)  Khalida Jarrar, a Palestinian human rights defender and feminist and member of the Palestinian parliament, has been arbitrarily exiled by Israel's army from Ramallah to a distant part of the West Bank.  26 August 2014 (ISIS massacres Shi'ite prisoners)  ISIS massacred Shi'ite prisoners in Mosul after telling them they were about to be released. This lie reminds me of the lies Nazis told to Jews to get them to cooperate with being killed.  I suspect the purpose of this massacre was to provoke Shi'ite militias to massacre Sunnis and thus force Sunnis to support ISIS.  26 August 2014 (Euro-austerity)  Germany may be forced to allow euro-austerity to stop.  26 August 2014 (Diablo Canyon nuclear reactors)  A former Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspector says that the NRC is ignoring its safety guidelines regarding the safety of the Diablo Canyon reactor in case of earthquake.  26 August 2014 (Shutdown of unofficial poll in Macao)  In Macao, an unofficial poll of citizens satisfaction with the chief official was shut down forcibly, based on an absurd pretext as usual.  26 August 2014 (How harsh reactions can backfire)  Strong and harsh reactions to the spreading of Islamist ideology can backfire (not to mention that they can violate human rights).  26 August 2014 (Heating of Earth's surface)  Short-term events and cycles explain the short-term discrepancy in heating of the Earth's surface since 2000, showing that the climate models were correct overall for the long term.  26 August 2014 (Cameron wants another "war on terror")  Cameron wants to grab at the ISIS provocation to start another open-ended "war on terror".  As the article says, this is strategically foolish; but it's a great excuse to smash what remains of civil liberties with "anti-terrorist" laws which can then be turned against dissidents, journalists, and journalists' spouses.  26 August 2014 (Faculty offer cancelled due to tweets)  The University of Illinois confirmed that it cancelled its faculty offer to Steven Salaita because he had criticized on Twitter the Israeli occupation pf Palestine.  I asked someone to find me a sample of his tweets; these are what I received.  I try my best to remember that we don't just stumble into political consciousness; it's better to teach than to berate or shame.  "Hamas" is the biggest red herring in American political discourse since Saddam's "weapons of mass destruction."  When will the attack on #Gazaend? What is left for #Israelto prove? Who is left for Israel to kill? This is the logic of genocide.  Members of the Knesset routinely call for the elimination of Palestinians, so #Israel can spare us the bullshit about restraint in #Gaza.  #Israelgets billions in aid, arms, and financial subsidies from the US, yet most Americans condemn imaginary Black women for welfare.  Rednecks need a new slogan. Instead of "kick their ass and take their gas," how about "#Gazais a disaster, but Netanyahu is my master"?  Republicans are such tough guys, eager to kill 4 God and country. #Israel slaps around the US of A, though, and all they do is ask for more.  The dude who wrote the genocide is permissible article has an egg avatar. Total hasbara troll.  I just got an email condemning my "slander of holy Israel." I reckon I can accept "slander," but "holy" seems a bit out of place.  I don't see anything here that legitimately justifies taking away a teacher's job.  26 August 2014 (UK's sham democracy)  As Scotland votes about independence, one Englishman is envious, wishing England had the chance to escape from its sham democracy.  What this says to me is that independence for Scotland is a side issue. All of the UK needs to real democracy.  26 August 2014 (Entrenched systematic bigotry)  Entrenched systematic bigotry means that fatal accidents systematically happen to the group on the receiving end.  26 August 2014 (Plastic fibers in harbors)  Harbors around the world have plastic fibers in the water, which can harm fish.  It will take a lot of work to find out how these fibers affect various species of fish.  26 August 2014 (Rush to approve killing a US citizen)  David Barron, now Federal Judge Barron, was in an awful rush to approve killing a US citizen with no criminal charges based on nothing but intelligence reports.  We know how a president can shape intelligence reports around whatever result he seeks, so this is little limitation.  26 August 2014 (Employees' social media profiles)  35% of young Britons would be happy to show their social media profiles to employers if pressured to do so.  The report says "in exchange for job security", which sounds like a benefit; but since employers can reduce job security to zero if they wish, in practice it means, "If you don't show us, you'll be fired (or never hired)."  It should be illegal for employers to even ask.  26 August 2014 (Outcomes of trials in Florida)  The outcome of trials in Florida is affected by the race of the people in the jury pool, in a strange way.  If all the jury pool is white, black defendants are more likely to get convicted than white defendants. But if at least one black person shows up for the jury pool, the disparity disappears &mdash; even a jury is made up only of whites.  I think it would be legitimate to arrange for partial racial balance in jury pools if that eliminates demonstrated unfairness in trial outcomes.  26 August 2014 (Roundup-ready GMO corn study)  The study that found damage in animals that were exposed to Roundup, or that ate Roundup-ready GMO corn, has been published again.  The journal that published it first later retracted it in suspicious circumstances.  26 August 2014 (Racism)  Thugs killed another black man in St Louis, not far from Ferguson. Video shows that there was no reason to shoot him, let alone shoot him 12 times rapidly without waiting as much as 15 seconds.  It could well be that those thugs really believed he was threatening them. Part of the effect of racism is that it leads people to perceive a black male as potentially violent. If the thugs are allowed to cite this as an excuse for killing someone, their murder spree will go unchecked.  Racist thinking is associated with the bad logic of "essentialist" thinking, but specific kinds of experiences can lead people out of such thinking.  25 August 2014 (Racist assaults teach justified rage)  Racist assaults, often by thugs, are frequent occurrences for blacks in the US, which teach them a justified rage.  Learning to control so much justified rage is not easy. It would help if they could get justice.  25 August 2014 (Shi'ite militias intend to expel Sunnis)  The Shi'ite militias that resist ISIS, where the Iraqi army is incompetent to do so, hate Sunnis and intend to expel them from any areas they capture from ISIS.  This is likely to force Sunnis to support ISIS even if they detest ISIS's oppression and cruelty. Unless they have somewhere else to turn, and at present they don't.  US Republicans want the US to intervene against ISIS in Syria.  I don't think the killing of one US journalist, on top of so many others murdered by ISIS, is particularly important. I don't think ISIS is close to attacking the US itself. Whether this sort of intervention is right depends mainly on its effects on the region itself. I can see the reasons in favor, but I also worry that things can go wrong in ways we are not likely to anticipate.  US military support for Kurdistan makes sense because Kurdistan is a nation fighting a conventional war. It has an army that is loyal to something more than its pay. In addition, Kurdistan is not likely to fall into brutality comparable to that of ISIS or the Shi'ite militias.  The use of drones to attack ISIS poses no special ethical issue because the targets are military units, typically equipped with unmistakable military vehicles or heavy weapons &mdash; not cars, houses and groups of people standing around, that might well have civilians in them.  Can/will Kurdistan protect Sunni Arabs that wish to join it? Can it offer them a way out of support for ISIS?  25 August 2014 (B'liar's business advised dictator of Kazakhstan)  Tony B'liar's business accepted a lot of money to advise the dictator of Kazakhstan on how to damp down the bad publicity he got from shooting a bunch of protesters and crushing the opposition.  25 August 2014 (A proprietary World Wide Web)  Google seems to be aiming slowly to make the World Wide Web effectively its proprietary product.  25 August 2014 (Liberal Zionism among Jews)  Israel's shift to right-wing racism means that Liberal Zionism among Jews elsewhere has hit a dead end.  Liberal Zionism means support for a Liberal Israel which no longer exists; Israelis who would support it are met with intimidation, even repression. No wonder 40% of Israelis are thinking of emigrating.  25 August 2014 (UK cuts in support for local government)  UK cuts in support for local government are focused on the poorest areas.  25 August 2014 (When thugs get fired)  When thugs do something violent, and get fired, they frequently move on to some other town that doesn't care.  25 August 2014 (Sugar in foods you would not expect)  Campaigning against the practice of putting sugar in lots of foods where you would not expect it.  25 August 2014 (Thug shot at Michael Brown as he was running away)  The Ferguson thugs confirm that a thug shot at Michael Brown as he was running away.  Apparently that shot did not hit Brown, but that miss is no excuse for shooting at someone who was no threat.  After they shot Brown, the thugs did not allow a nurse to perform CPR.  That amounts to deliberate murder.  25 August 2014 (Voter registration booths in Ferguson)  The head of the Missouri Republican Party thinks it is shameful that voter registration booths have been set up in Ferguson.  Republicans can't count on voter-suppression laws to prevent black citizens from voting; some of them will succeed in voting if they try.  25 August 2014 (India has permitted the entry of GMOs)  The government of India has permitted the entry of GMOs, disregarding its own laws over and over.  25 August 2014 (Opposition to ISIS)  Various states and parties in the Muslim world are declaring their opposition to ISIS.  25 August 2014 (Chinese film festival shut down)  Beijing Independent Film Festival Shut Down by Chinese Authorities.  25 August 2014 (Austerity in Europe)  Austerity Has Made Europe's Depression Longer Than In The 1930s.  25 August 2014 (Economic growth with less energy use)  Economic growth used to require more energy use, but now it is possible to invest in energy efficiency leading to growth with less energy use. Many governments don't do that, because they have surrendered to the fossil fuel companies, which won't permit it.  However, economic growth is not invariably a good thing. It is good when people generally share in it and it reduces inequality.  25 August 2014 (No expectation of justice for Brown)  The black citizens of Ferguson do not expect justice for Michael Brown.  25 August 2014 (Israel destroys two large buildings)  Israel completely destroyed two large buildings in Gaza, saying that Hamas was using space in them.  One of them had 44 apartments. Hamas should not have used one of them for warlike activities &mdash; if indeed it did so; I would not take Israel's word for that. But if Hamas did so, that doesn't excuse destroying the building.  25 August 2014 (Tripoli under Islamist control)  Islamists took control of Tripoli, bringing about the semipermanent fracture of Libya.  25 August 2014 (Racist repression)  From Gaza to Ferguson: Exposing the Toolbox of Racist Repression.  The US has seen cycles of racial segregation and desegregation in different areas. Segregated areas for blacks tend to be ruled by whites, with thugs that repress the black inhabitants on various pretexts.  Ferguson became poor, where people can barely get by from week to week and people can't afford education, as a result of companies' moving manufacturing out of the US.  Being poor, they are continually harassed by the US legal system, which in 2013 delivered three warrants per household in the town.  25 August 2014 (GE eucalyptus trees)  Genetically engineered eucalyptus trees won't directly hurt people, but they have the potential to do great ecological harm and encourage land grabs.  25 August 2014 ("Suspension" of the First Amendment)  The ACLU says that the First Amendment was "suspended" in Ferguson; the right to protest, or report on protest, was loaded with impossible requirements.  It points out that journalism in the US is under general attack.  25 August 2014 (Unpleasantness of Comcast)  The reason it is so unpleasant to deal with Comcast is that call center staff are under pressure to sell something, regardless of the purpose of the call.  25 August 2014 (Obama regime argues Nuremberg irrelevant)  The Obama regime argues in court that the Nuremberg trials are legally irrelevant to the culpability of Bush and his officials for the crime of aggressive war.  It is easy for US law to define US officials as legally immune from prosecution for whatever crime it may be. The moral argument is harder for them to win.  25 August 2014 (US university imposes censorship)  A lousy US university has imposed censorship on network access for students and others on campus.  25 August 2014 (Melting of ice sheets)  Satellite observations show that the melting of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has doubled since 2009.  Don't buy land within a few meters of sea level!  25 August 2014 (US thugs want more military weapons)  US thugs are campaigning to continue receiving military weapons and gear.  25 August 2014 (Ferguson thug "relieved of duty")  A thug from the vicinity of Ferguson was "relieved of duty" after it was seen that he had made a bigoted right-wing speech in an organization primarily of thugs and soldiers.  The thug has not been fired.  25 August 2014 (Abbott to push global heating)  Despite Abbott's mystification, his policies clearly reflect the intention to push global heating to the max.  25 August 2014 (Ferguson's Black community)  Ferguson's Black Community Must Not Be Given the Same 'Justice' As Trayvon Martin.  24 August 2014 (Right-Wing operative trying to do a hatchet job)  The Center for Media and Democracy, which often reports on ALEC's lobbying, believes that a right-wing operative is trying to do a hatchet job. He's the one who destroyed ACORN by publishing a misleading video.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: A fair and predictable work week)  Everyone: tell Starbucks to offer employees a fair and predictable work week.  24 August 2014 (The Lac M&eacute;gantic oil train explosion)  The Lac M&eacute;gantic oil train explosion was a disaster waiting to happen, due to weak safety rules granted to railroad magnates by an evidently corrupted government.  24 August 2014 (The kidnaping and killing of three Israeli teenagers)  A Hamas representative living in Turkey said that Hamas was responsible for kidnaping and killing three Israeli teenagers.  However, there are doubts about whether the Hamas leadership really ordered the kidnaping is not clear.  24 August 2014 (Australia's proposal for increased surveillance)  Australia's proposal for increased surveillance is written so broadly that the spy agency would be allowed to access any computer on the internet.  The government says wiping out privacy is supposed to be legitimate because "we're protecting you". The usual stupid excuse of tyrants.  24 August 2014 (US compensation for civilians killed in Yemen)  The US may be funding compensation for civilians killed in Yemen while refusing to admit killing them.  24 August 2014 (What Britain would have if it had avoided Tony B'liar)  What Britain would have if it had avoided Tony B'liar.  24 August 2014 (Ferguson relates to net neutrality)  Ferguson relates to net neutrality, which enables people to spread the word about what the thugs are doing.  It also relates to censorship by Facebook and now Twitter too.  24 August 2014 (Ocean cycles coincided in sinking Earth's acquired heat)  Two different ocean cycles coincided in sinking Earth's acquired heat for the past decade, so that the atmosphere didn't warm all that much.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: List the northern long-eared bat as endangered)  US citizens: call on the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: Support regulation of pollution from oil refineries)  US citizens: Americans, comment to the EPA to support regulation of pollution from oil refineries.  24 August 2014 (UK must nationalize the trains)  The UK must nationalize the trains; privatizing them was wrong.  Privatization of a government service is generally harmful unless it allows the public to buy from a free competitive market. Otherwise, the private owners increase their profits by shafting the public, the workers, or both.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: End Google's support for ALEC)  Everyone: tell Google to stop supporting ALEC.  ALEC lobbies for damaging laws in US states and cities, but you don't need to be a US citizen to put pressure on Google.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: No heavy weapons for thugs)  US citizens: Sign this petition to stop providing heavy weapons to thugs.  24 August 2014 (Why Israel wants to keep fighting in Gaza)  Uri Avnery on why Israel wants to keep fighting in Gaza.  Avnery suspects that the three rockets supposedly launched from Gaza weren't really launched from Gaza.  24 August 2014 (Fanatics attack mosque in Iraq)  Shi'ite fanatics attacked a Sunni mosque in Iraq, killing almost 100 people.  Aside from being an atrocity, this will help ISIS gain support and commit atrocities.  24 August 2014 (Hollywood treatment of abortions)  Why Hollywood treats abortions as shocking and shameful &mdash; in contrast to the 1980s, when it treated them as no big deal.  24 August 2014 (US fighting in Iraq)  The US is not giving much information about its fighting in Iraq.  Drone weapons turn out to be convenient for suppressing journalism. In Dubya's invasion of Iraq, the Bush forces pressured nearly all journalists to "embed", which both limited their movements and pressured them to bias their coverage. But there's not even room for an embedded reporter in a drone.  24 August 2014 (Privatization in Britain)  Privatization in Britain has followed the path of privatization in Russia, leading to an immense transfer of wealth to the new owners.  24 August 2014 (Russian "humanitarian aid")  Most of the Russian "humanitarian aid" trucks entered Ukraine without inspection.  Putin would never go to such trouble for humanitarian purposes. This must have some harmful motive.  24 August 2014 (Racists cheer killing of blacks)  US right-wing racists are raising funds to support the thug that killed Michael Brown, cheering on the killing of more blacks.  24 August 2014 (Student reenactment of killings)  A teacher in the US was punished for allowing students to reenact two controversial killings, which the students themselves selected as important current events.  I don't see why students should not learn about these events in that way.  24 August 2014 (Mortar fired into town kills child)  A Palestinian mortar rocket killed an Israeli child.  Firing mortars at towns is a war crime, just like the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.  24 August 2014 (Pranksters threatened with prison)  Pranksters accused of painting the side of a building in Moscow are threatened with 7 years in prison.  They say they did not do the painting, but the more important point is that whoever did the painting should not be imprisoned.  23 August 2014 (School-to-prison pipeline)  The school-to-prison pipeline at work: a student in South Carolina was suspended from school, then arrested, for writing a story about shooting a pet dinosaur.  The thugs say he was arrested for his reaction when the thugs threatened him. Of course, being threatened by armed thugs who can put you in prison by lying about you is enough to rattle most anyone. It takes training and experience to avoid giving them something they can twist into an excuse to put you in the wrong.  23 August 2014 (India censors film)  India has censored a film about the assassination of Indira Gandhi because of the political slant of certain scenes.  This shows where the UK will get to if it continues down the path of political censorship.  A censorship board that does its job "honestly" is a bigger threat to human rights than one that can be bribed not to censor.  23 August 2014 (The Security Council and Syria)  The UN human rights chief says the Security Council's ineffectiveness on Syria caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.  However, there is was no proper action the Security Council could have taken in regard to Syria, even if it had not been paralyzed between the US and Russia.  The US and UK are now being drawn by necessity into allying with Assad in Syria against ISIS.  The only chance for supporting opposition to Assad with good results was when the opposition was not jihadi. I think Saudi Arabia and Qatar are to blame for the jihadists in Syria.  23 August 2014 (Public school spending cuts)  The public school reality that white Americans won't see: cuts in spending, especially on schools in poor neighborhoods, track the children (mostly minority groups) into bad lives (or prison).  The various "education reform" programs that the US has seen since 2000 in effect pretend to compensate for these cuts with burdensome handwaving. The result is that poor American children have been forced into what we might call "reform school".  24 August 2014 (Urgent: Reject the Comcast-TWC merger)  US citizens: call on the FCC to reject the Comcast-TWC merger.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: Reject palm oil made from deforestation)  Everyone: call on McDonalds to pledge to reject palm oil made from deforestation.  I have never eaten at McDonalds, because I don't need to repeat someone else's mistake in order to learn from it. McDonalds makes fast food &mdash; food for not eating.  24 August 2014 (UK gov't planning giveaway of public land)  The UK government is planning a massive giveaway of public land, a requirement to extract all fossil fuels, and abolition of local planning.  24 August 2014 (Thailand made military coup permanent)  Thailand has made its military coup effectively permanent by declaring the head general to be "prime minister".  24 August 2014 (Urgent: Don't import apples from China)  US citizens: tell the USDA, don't import apples from China.  24 August 2014 (Hamas supports Palestine's joining the ICC)  Hamas supports Palestine's joining the International Criminal Court. This would expose Hamas and its agents to war crimes prosecutions, as well as Israel and its agents.  24 August 2014 (UK immigration prisons paying prisoners a pittance)  UK immigration prisons are paying prisoners a pittance to cook and clean. Ironically, those prisoners are not allowed to work in the UK outside prison.  This practice hurts not only the prisoners but all workers in the UK. Whoever does this work should be paid a decent wage.  24 August 2014 (Green Party condemns injustices in policing)  The Green Party condemns many systematic injustices in the policing of the US.  24 August 2014 (Corporations Spy on Nonprofits)  Corporations Spy on Nonprofits (that criticize them) with Impunity (in the US).  24 August 2014 (Protesters Hold Up Mirrors to Police)  Oakland Protesters Hold Up Mirrors to Police Officers in Ferguson Solidarity March.  Thousands rallied in New York City.  24 August 2014 (Bank of America agreed to pay a fine for mortgage fraud)  Bank of America agreed to pay a fine for mortgage fraud, but it's much smaller than it appears to be.  24 August 2014 (Consult Congress before military interventions)  Congress should insist that Obama consult Congress before military interventions such as the bombing campaign in Iraq.  24 August 2014 (Insurance coverage of contraception)  Obama has taken steps to protect insurance coverage of contraception from the Hobby Lobby decision.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: Oppose Comcast-Time Warner merger)  US citizens: submit a comment to the FCC opposing the merger between Comcast and Time Warner.  That two companies with such large share of any market should not be allowed to merge ought to be a no-brainer. Unfortunately, the US goverment has been turned into a zombie by businesses, and has trouble with no-brainers.  23 August 2014 (Urgent: Stop supporting Urban Shield)  Everyone: call on Marriott to stop supporting Urban Shield, the main US event to promote militarization of thugs.  23 August 2014 (Urgent: Prosecutor for killing of Brown)  Everyone: call on DA McCulloch to appoint a special prosecutor for the killing of Michael Brown.  23 August 2014 (Sweden sentences artist to prison)  Sweden sentenced an artist to prison for "racist" art.  I share their disapproval of racism, but censorship threatens everyone.  23 August 2014 (World Bank redefining poverty)  The World Bank and friends say that they are eliminating poverty, but it's more like redefining poverty.  23 August 2014 (Canada's attempt to gag professor)  Canadian professor John Smol rebuked the government for trying to gag him from talking about his measurements of pollution from oil sand strip mining.  23 August 2014 (US "war on terror")  The US "war on terror" has not only failed, it has backfired.  23 August 2014 (US "economic recovery" lopsided)  The US "economic recovery" is lopsided, leaving low-paid workers poorer than before.  23 August 2014 (Earnings for Britons under 30)  Earnings for Britons under 30 have fallen around 10% in 4 years.  23 August 2014 (UK censorship in politics)  UK censorship expands to politics with a vengeance; the government threatens anyone redistributing or even watching an ISIS propaganda video.  Censorship "invariably starts with the suppression of viewpoints which are so widely hated that the emotional response they produce drowns out any consideration of the principle being endorsed."  23 August 2014 (Withdrawl of National Guard from Ferguson)  The National Guard is being withdrawn from Ferguson.  I hope that the protests do not peter out soon. Nothing fundamental has been corrected.  23 August 2014 (Trial of Sharif Mobley blocked)  The trial of Sharif Mobley is blocked because the Yemeni government is holding him in a secret prison and won't allow him to see the court or his lawyers.  22 August 2014 (Protests in NYC, LA, Oakland)  Protests have occurred in NYC, Los Angeles, Oakland and elsewhere against the killing of local people by thugs and in solidarity with Ferguson.  22 August 2014 (Russian humanitarian aid convoy)  The Russian humanitarian aid convoy is starting to enter Ukraine after Red Cross inspection.  Putin could have got all these trucks inspected by the Red Cross days before, and into Ukraine without conflict, if he had wanted to.  22 August 2014 (Venezuela to use biometric card)  Venezuela plans to use a biometric card to ration subsidized products so they won't be smuggled into Colombia and resold.  Switching to a system like food stamps would solve this problem pretty well.  22 August 2014 (Cameras on meter maids)  It's right to make thugs wear cameras in public, but why do that to meter maids?  22 August 2014 (Twitter censors video)  Twitter undermines its history of respect for freedom of speech by censoring a bloody ISIS propaganda video.  Operators of Diaspora hosts are reportedly threatened with punishment if people post the ISIS propaganda on their hosts.  I think this is censorship as dangerous as ISIS. Your opinions are next on the list.  22 August 2014 (Airport X-ray scanners)  Tests prove that many kinds of weapons and explosives can be smuggled through the X-ray scanners that were formerly used, untested, for "security" in airports.  Even worse, if one of these machines were to break, it could give a person a dangerous radiation burn. Once I learned that, I opted out every time. I said, "Please feel me up."  22 August 2014 (Israeli weapons factory in UK shut down)  Protesters explain why they shut down an Israeli weapons factory in the UK.  The crime of "aggravated trespass" is a synonym for "annoying protest". To accuse anyone of that crime is a sign of an antidemocratic government.  22 August 2014 (Neighborhood in Liberia quarantined)  A neighborhood in Liberia has been quarantined to block spread of Ebola.  I don't know whether this sort of measure is effective enough to justify the loss of liberty it involves.  22 August 2014 (Repression of Australia's homeless)  Repression of the homeless in Australia: in Melbourne, begging is a crime.  As the Australian government proposes to cut the support for the unemployed, especially those under 30, it will make more homeless people that will be forced into "crime".  22 August 2014 (Aborting Down's syndrome fetuses)  Richard Dawkins says that women have a moral duty to abort a fetus that has Down's syndrome.  I completely concur. Having a baby with Down's syndrome does harm to someone (that baby). An abortion does no harm to anyone.  22 August 2014 (US military prohibits reading The Intercept)  The US military says that employees will be punished if they read The Intercept.  This prohibition would be ludicrous if it were not so dangerous. It covers millions of people, soldiers and civilians, many of whom will obey the prohibition. Then they will base their thoughts on, and spread, a warped world view which they have taken for truth.  22 August 2014 (Ferguson protests)  Ferguson protests respond to systematic repression and disenfranchisement.  22 August 2014 (Ferguson thugs raid church)  Thugs in Ferguson raided a church that was providing medical care to protesters who were suffering from tear gas.  22 August 2014 (Another proposed oil pipeline)  Mobilizing Canadians against the Atlantic substitute for the Keystone XL pipeline.  22 August 2014 (Urgent: Help End Domestic Slavery)  US citizens: Help End Domestic Slavery.  With Javascript disabled, this page does work even though it appears to have failed.  22 August 2014 (Investigators barred from Gaza)  Israel is blocking the staff of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch from going to Gaza to investigate war crimes.  22 August 2014 (Rising sea level)  A town in the Solomon Islands has to move to higher ground as sea level rises.  The US must start planning to move parts of Boston, parts of New York City, parts of Washington DC, and all of Florida. This move won't be needed for some decades, but it will take decades to do.  22 August 2014 (Hidden costs of fracking)  The hidden costs of fracking are tremendous.  22 August 2014 (Arrested for filming NY thugs)  New York gubernatorial candidate Randy Credico was arrested and given a little gratuitous torture in New York City for making a video of thugs' arresting someone else.  I hope he wins and starts jailing thugs for such conduct.  22 August 2014 (Activist, age 90, arrested in Ferguson)  Activist Hedy Epstein, age 90, was arrested for protesting in Ferguson.  Her supposed "crime" was simply continuing to protest.  Thugs in Ferguson repeatedly offered to "help" some reporters by taking them far away from the protests, "for their safety".  Considering that the only danger to them is from the thugs, this is really half of a threat.  22 August 2014 (New Australian coal mine)  A new Australian coal mine was allowed to dicker down the compensation it would have to pay for predicted damage to the Great Barrier Reef.  For several reasons, this mine should not be allowed at all.  22 August 2014 (The Real Looting of Ferguson)  The Real Looting of Ferguson: Its Black Citizens Never Had a Chance to Get By.  22 August 2014 (Secrets exposed by James Risen)  Here are the embarrassing secrets for which Obama plans to imprison James Risen.  22 August 2014 (Civilian casualties in Gaza)  A former Israeli gun crew chief says he does not believe Israel's claim to have tried to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.  22 August 2014 (Corporations expect tax amnesty)  US corporations claim that corporation taxes are too high, but really they believe that since they got one tax amnesty they are entitled to tax amnesties ad infinitem.  22 August 2014 (Reading on the Amazon Swindle)  A study found that people who read novels on the Amazon Swindle remember less of the events.  I think issues like this are less important than the injustice of the Swindle.  22 August 2014 (New military weapons for thugs)  They claim that military weapons and equipment for thugs are "surplus", but 1/3 of them are new.  I think there are multiple motives for it. Repressing racial minorities and the poor is one reason. Feeding the manufacturers is another.  21 August 2014 (Urgent: Stop choosing McCain as a pundit)  In the US, or where US TV networks are available: Call on TV networks to stop choosing McCain as a pundit.  21 August 2014 (Override state laws purchased by ISPs)  US cities, and senators, are asking the FCC to override state laws purchased by ISPs that ban municipal broadband networks.  21 August 2014 (Saudi Arabia's role in creating ISIS)  Saudi Arabia's role in creating ISIS, the monster that it can no longer control.  21 August 2014 (Someone in Gaza fired rockets at Israel)  Someone in Gaza fired rockets at Israel, breaking the cease fire. Israel responded by killing the family of a Hamas leader, and another family.  21 August 2014 (US thugs keep on killing unarmed black men)  US thugs keep on killing unarmed black men, then fabricating excuses.  Here's What Happens to Police Officers Who Shoot Unarmed Black Men.  White Supremacy Is the Real Culprit in Ferguson. The Excuses Just Prove It.  21 August 2014 (Undo militarization of US thugs)  Dennis Kucinich explains what is needed to undo militarization of US thugs.  21 August 2014 (Israel kills Gazans all the time)  Israel kills Gazans all the time, not just when there is a war.  21 August 2014 (Israel campaigning to undermine international humanitarian law)  Israel is systematically campaigning to undermine international humanitarian law &mdash; the treaties about war crimes which Israel has been condemned for violating.  21 August 2014 (Israeli soldiers arrested 64 Palestinian)  Israeli soldiers arrested 64 Palestinians from the West Bank, clearly for political reasons.  Israeli soldiers demolished a Palestinian home in Jerusalem without warning, and did not allow the inhabitants to take out any of their property.  21 August 2014 (Israeli sociologist tries to explain psychology of fear)  An Israeli sociologist tries to explain the psychology of fear that enables Israelis to see themselves as humane while dehumanizing Palestinians.  The article also offers explanations for how Israel became almost entirely hawkish, racist and right-wing.  If 40% of Israelis wish to emigrate, I suspect that it's because those who are more or less secular expect the religious fanatics to take over and oppress them.  21 August 2014 (ISIS advancing in Syria)  ISIS is advancing territory in Syria using weapons captured from the Iraqi army.  It seems the West must attack ISIS in Syria to protect Assad. Murderous as he is, letting ISIS defeat him would be even worse.  20 August 2014 (Urgent: Tighten rules on ivory)  US citizens: call for the US to tighten rules on ivory, to protect elephants.  20 August 2014 (Artist/Hackers who put white flags on Brooklyn Bridge)  Two artist/hackers who put white flags on the Brooklyn Bridge fear they will be permanently excluded from the US.  It sure looks like the US has no sense of humor.  20 August 2014 (Iraqi gov't failed in an attempt to retake Tikrit)  The Iraqi government failed in an attempt to retake Tikrit; Isis soldiers gave hard resistance.  US air strikes are easy and effective in open country, but not in cities.  If Tikrit is indeed controlled by Baathists and Sunni militants, as the article says, it should be possible to make a peace with them. They can't be very happy with Isis; they must regard it as a last resort to get out from under the Maliki's sectarian rule. The challenge will be to convince them that a new Iraqi government won't be equally bad.  20 August 2014 (Urgent: Protect Americans from oil trains)  US citizens: call on the DOT to protect Americans from oil trains.  20 August 2014 (Australia forcing Syrian refugees back to Syria)  Australia is going to "unthinkable" lengths to force Syrian refugees back to Syria, where they face torture or death.  20 August 2014 (Australian state proposes guilty-until-proven-innocent)  The Australian state of Victoria proposes US-style seizure of possessions on a system of guilty-until-proven-innocent.  20 August 2014 (ICANN considering giving gov'ts total power)  ICANN is considering giving governments almost total power over its decisions.  20 August 2014 (Journalist reports on his arrest in Ferguson)  A journalist reports on his arrest in Ferguson. Thugs shot him first. They did not really care why he was there; they were arresting anyone who could be found.  Note the sleazy excuse for denying the journalist the right to phone his lawyer. Just the sort of behavior I'd expect from a thug.  Then a press photographer was arrested, for not standing where the thugs wanted photographers to stand. These thugs think they are entitled to control protests and control the press.  I am glad that some of the protesters tried to control random violence by other protesters. That sort of indiscipline leads to defeat. While it is less serious, intrinsically, than the thugs' violence, it gives the thugs an excuse to pretend that they are protecting the town rather than occupying it.  Some suspect that the few violent protesters are outsiders.  The next night, they arrested 78 people, protesters and bystanders and journalists I suppose.  20 August 2014 (Countries that trample human rights given opportunity to retort)  Other countries that trample human rights more than the US find in Ferguson an opportunity to retort.  I wish the US would clean up its act so it could criticize oppression without making people laugh.  20 August 2014 (Arrests of Reporters in Ferguson)  The Committee to Protect Journalists Condemns Ongoing Harassment, Arrests of Reporters in Ferguson.  20 August 2014 (Guatemala's New DC Lobbyist)  The Man Who Ran Contra Propaganda for Reagan Is Guatemala's New DC Lobbyist.  20 August 2014 (Urgent: Union organizing bill)  US citizens: support the bill to make firing union organizers a matter of discrimination.  It's already forbidden, but this would make it easier and faster to enforce the ban.  20 August 2014 (Lobbying by UK environmental dept)  The UK's environmental department is lobbying the EU to keep a very dirty coal power plant running.  20 August 2014 (City councilor of Ferguson)  One of the thugs who accused Henry Davis of "destruction of property" for bleeding on their uniforms is now a city councilor in Ferguson.  20 August 2014 (Wealth of the 1%)  The wealth of the 1% is literally beyond measure, because they hide so much of it. What they sequester has prevented economic recovery for the rest.  20 August 2014 (UK's complicity in CIA torture)  The UK ambassador to the US has been lobbying the US Senate since 2012 to conceal the UK's complicity in CIA torture.  20 August 2014 (Gang of thugs)  A gang of thugs (not cops this time)  attacked an editor in Sudan that had advocated normalizing relations with Israel, and trashed the newspaper office.  20 August 2014 (Whipped for criticizing book)  Two Iranians will be whipped for criticizing a book published by a local official on artistic grounds.  20 August 2014 (Language of the unheard)  M. L. King: A riot is the language of the unheard.  20 August 2014 (Civilians in convoy hit by rockets)  Ukraine and rebels accuse each other of firing rockets at a convoy that was evacuating civilians.  I expect that neither side attacked them intentionally, but this is the sort of thing that happens in war, and even more so when care is not taken.  However, firing the inaccurate Grad rockets into urban areas is a war crime, and I have seen accusations that Ukraine regularly does that.  20 August 2014 (Ferguson thug violence facts)  Ten Facts About Police Violence in Ferguson Sunday Night.  20 August 2014 (Militarization of US thugs)  Arms companies have effectively paid Congress to support militarization of US thugs.  20 August 2014 (Failure to coexist)  The pollution and resource scarcity problems that humanity is creating can be seen as a failure in coexistence with the natural world.  20 August 2014 (New "counter-terrorism" proposals in Australia)  Civil liberties organizations in Australia warn that human rights are threatened by the new "counter-terrorism" proposals.  There is very little danger of terrorism in Australia. It's just an excuse to attack human rights.  20 August 2014 (Extreme capitalism)  Extreme capitalism is the idea that every aspect of society has to be run as a business. This is a major cause of what's wrong in US education and health care.  20 August 2014 (Urgent: Respect the rights of peaceful protesters)  US citizens: support Amnesty International's call for the Ferguson thug chief to respect the rights of peaceful protesters.  20 August 2014 (Republicans blocking funds for processing "rape kits")  Republicans are blocking federal funds for processing the backlog of "rape kits" containing evidence from complaints of rape.  Those right-wingers don't care much about any sort of rights if they are for women.  20 August 2014 (Undermining Constitution with illegal spying and dirty tricks)  Richard Nixon faced impeachment for undermining the Constitution with illegal spying and dirty tricks. Under Bushbama it's even worse.  20 August 2014 (Earth Overshoot Day)  Aug 19 is "Earth Overshoot Day", the day when we've used, since the beginning of the year, as much resources as the Earth can sustain for the whole year.  Just 14 years ago, that point was reached in October.  20 August 2014 (Irom Sharmila ordered for release)  Irom Sharmila has been in prison and on hunger strike for 14 years after witnessing a massacre by the Indian Army.  I think she was never given a trial, but a court now ordered her release.  20 August 2014 (You don't control your mobile phone)  Bringing home the fact that you don't control your mobile phone, there's an app to give someone else remote control over it.  20 August 2014 (Obama is stretching the facts)  Obama is stretching the facts to avoid asking Congress for authorization to use military force in Iraq.  Congress should not accept this stretching. What's at stake is the US Constitution.  20 August 2014 (Urgent: Defend the rights of the Tibetan people)  Everyone: call for your country to defend the rights of the Tibetan people under repression.  When 100 Tibetans protested, Chinese thugs shot several, then arrested them and denied them medical treatment. Some died from this.  20 August 2014 (We can switch entirely to renewable energy)  Amory Lovins claims we can switch entirely to renewable energy without on-grid storage by using time-shifting to make demand fit the momentary supply.  We need to be careful to set up these systems so that they don't collect information about what systems we are using.  For instance, if the goal is to tell 1/4 of the air conditioning systems in a substantial area to shut off, it isn't necessary to find out which ones happen to be on at the moment. Statistically, the result would be roughly the same if you make the decision based on which houses have such air conditioning.  19 August 2014 (On Hacking updates)  Update to On Hacking to recognize that "hacking" is not supposed to cover wit and art.  18 August 2014 (Cesarean section forced on woman)  A desperate woman in Ireland was forced to have a cesarean section, when she threatened to starve herself after being denied an abortion.  She was pregnant because of a rape committed before she reached Ireland.  Abortion is a basic right.  18 August 2014 (Iraqi Kurds recapture Mosul dam)  The Iraqi Kurds recaptured the Mosul dam, with US air support.  18 August 2014 (Michael Brown's autopsy report)  Michael Brown's autopsy report says he was shot 6 times, all from the front.  Even if the thug's actions after stopping Brown were not wrong, it seems clear he would not have stopped a white man.  US thugs will let you walk around with a weapon (in some states) &hellip; if you're white. If you're black, they order you to drop it, and shoot you before you have a chance to comply, even if it's a toy.  In other words, "open carry" laws potentiate the effect of racist attitudes.  18 August 2014 (Cost of filing worker complaint in UK)  Now that the UK charges workers almost $2000 for filing a discrimination case, complaints have gone down by 80%. Only well-paid workers can afford to complain.  18 August 2014 (EPA fails to make polluters pay)  The EPA has failed for 30 years to issue legally required rules to make polluters pay to clean up their pollution.  18 August 2014 (Coal ash and asthma)  Just living near a place where coal ash is handled or dumped can give people asthma.  18 August 2014 (US pressure against Gaza inquiry)  The US is pressuring the ICC and Mahmoud Abbas not to request an investigation into Israeli and Palestinian war crimes.  18 August 2014 (Australia's renewable energy target)  Australia's government said it would maintain the renewable energy target but is clearly making plans to create an excuse to eliminate it.  18 August 2014 (The background of ISIS)  Explaining the background of ISIS in radicalization of Sunnis.  18 August 2014 (10,000 Israelis protest for peace)  10,000 Israelis demonstrated for peace with Gaza.  It was a good try, but I think it will take more than 10,000 to influence the government, and the Arab-hating people.  18 August 2014 (Western media's superficial view)  Western news media have a superficial view of many countries, because reporters nowadays don't stay in a place long enough to know what's what.  18 August 2014 (Curfew in Ferguson)  The curfew in Ferguson was obeyed by recognized leaders and organizers, but hundreds of people stayed past midnight in pouring rain rather than let thugs chase them out of their town.  This article says the thugs did use tear gas.  18 August 2014 (SWAT raids in the US)  Over 100 SWAT raids occur each day in the US, and most of them are for nothing more serious than searching a house for drugs.  This is accompanied by training thugs to act like an occupying army. If they expect to shoot people down, they will find opportunities to do it.  Here is data about the military equipment that the US has given to thugs.  18 August 2014 (Facebook forcing app on users)  Facebook is ordering users to switch to a different Messenger app which demands access to lots of personal information.  It's proprietary software, thus inherently untrustworthy, so using it is an act of folly. The same is true of Facebook's main app, and the nonfree program (in either iThings or Android) for accessing the app store where it is released.  In Android, that program is called Google Play, and it has a back door that is more or less universal.  Of course, you shouldn't be used by Facebook at all, because it extracts personal data that nobody ought to know.  18 August 2014 (Mob drives out Ebola patients)  A mob attacked a clinic in Liberia and drove out 29 people infected with Ebola.  Now they are likely to infect other people. Way to go, idiots!  The patients have been found and brought to another clinic.  18 August 2014 (Abbott serving fossil fuel companies)  Australian PM Abbott's plan to stop promoting renewable energy would amount to a 10 billion dollar gift to the fossil fuel companies he serves. And without even achieving the promised insignificant side benefit of a reduction in electricity prices.  18 August 2014 (Racist response to wedding in Israel)  A Jewish Israeli woman converted to Islam and is marrying an Arab. This has brought out various sorts of racists.  I find it hard to imagine a greater folly than for a woman to convert to Islam. But she has a right to do it, and a right to get married.  18 August 2014 (Torture of suspects)  A US woman accused in Indonesia of murdering her mother says that thugs are beating her and threatening to deny her water unless she confesses.  I have no opinion about whether she is guilty of those charges. There may be valid reasons to prosecute her, but suspects should not be tortured.  17 August 2014 ("We don't talk with terrorists")  The slogan "We don't talk with terrorists" is often an excuse to continue war.  Negotiating ransom with terrorists is what one should never do. Negotiating peace, that's different.  17 August 2014 (Urgent: Protect farm workers from dangerous pesticides)  US citizens: call on the EPA to protect farm workers from dangerous pesticides.  17 August 2014 (Ferguson Won't Be The Last Flash Point)  On Race, America Has Far to Go. Ferguson Won't Be The Last Flash Point.  17 August 2014 (Union activists blocked an Israeli ship from docking in Oakland)  Union activists blocked an Israeli ship from docking in Oakland as a protest against the bombardment of Gaza.  Australian thugs are trying to arbitrarily ban a protest against an Israeli film festival in Australia.  17 August 2014 (Urgent: Stop militarizing US thugs)  US citizens: sign these two petitions to stop militarizing US thugs.  17 August 2014 (Require supermarkets to donate unsold but still edible food)  French MPs propose to require supermarkets to donate unsold but still edible food to charities.  In principle, the idea seems good.  17 August 2014 (Poisonous algae in Lake Erie)  Poisonous algae in Lake Erie seem to result from a change in the form of phosphorus used in fertilizer.  17 August 2014 (Afghan thugs raided a coffee shop)  Afghan thugs raided a coffee shop because women and men were allowed to sit and talk there.  17 August 2014 (Question Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy)  Ecuador's foreign minister asks why the Swedish government fails to use the opportunity to question Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy, and thus denies justice both to Assange and to the women who made a complaint against him.  Of course, we can infer the answer easily.  17 August 2014 (California "Kill Switch" Bill)  California "Kill Switch" Bill Could Be Used to Disrupt Protests.  17 August 2014 (Advocates of greater regional autonomy in Russia)  Advocates of greater regional autonomy in Russia have been arrested and their demonstrations banned.  I think it is proper for wealthier regions to support the development of poorer regions; thus, I disagree with demands for independence from the wealthier regions based on objection to this; for example, in Catalunya because its taxes help poorer parts of Spain.  If Siberia is proportionally richer than other parts of Russia, I would object likewise in Siberia's case. But I don't know whether that is so, and I don't know what Putin is doing with the tax money.  17 August 2014 (Greatest Enemy of Press Freedom in a Generation)  James Risen Calls Obama 'Greatest Enemy of Press Freedom in a Generation'.  17 August 2014 (Urgent: Thank Obama)  US citizens: thank Obama for rethinking weapons deliveries to Israel.  17 August 2014 (Urgent: Disincentivize tax avoidance)  US citizens: call on Obama to eliminate the tax incentives for companies to move their headquarters outside the US.  17 August 2014 (UK thugs want people's medical records)  UK thugs want to be allowed to look at people's confidential medical records without getting a warrant (let alone permission). They cite "vulnerable" people as an excuse, but the loss of rights would apply to everyone.  Perhaps it is, in a sense, about vulnerable people. When undercover thugs infiltrate a dissident group, if they could check the medical records of everyone in the group, they could quickly find which ones are vulnerable to being pressured into a sexual relationship.  17 August 2014 (US media spin on Gazan casualties)  How US media spin the civilian casualties in Gaza &mdash; including claiming that civilians working for Hamas in non-military roles count as combatants.  17 August 2014 (iThing users' data in China)  Apple is storing the data of iThing users in China on servers in China.  Since Apple can extract lots of personal data from an iThing remotely, I think Apple will have great difficulty refusing when China demands that it do so.  17 August 2014 (Human rights lawyer tortured in China)  China released human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng from prison, starved and with smashed teeth.  His teeth fell out because he was given limited food. He was tortured both physically and mentally. Now he can hardly speak.  17 August 2014 (Ferguson protests)  Al Sharpton exhorted Ferguson protesters to avoid weakening their case by engaging in crimes such as looting.  This is wise advice: blacks of the 60s won advances in civil rights through discipline, and protesters today need discipline too.  Since then, a curfew has been imposed. I don't expect the protesters to disperse quietly just because someone told them to.  17 August 2014 (Ukrainian rebel soldiers)  A Ukrainian rebel leader claims to have 1200 soldiers who were trained in Russia, as well as 30 tanks.  They could not have captured 30 tanks from the Ukrainian army in that area. If the claim is true, most of those tanks must have come from Russia. Perhaps Russia captured Ukrainian tanks in the Crimea and sent them to Ukraine.  17 August 2014 (Poverty in the US)  Communities, Individuals, and the Long Fight Against Poverty [in the US].  This fight would not be nearly so long if not for the rich that defend poverty for everyone else.  17 August 2014 (Hillary-The-Hawk Flies Again)  Hillary-The-Hawk Flies Again.  17 August 2014 (Urgent: Reverse Corporations United)  US citizens: Call for approval of the constitutional amendment to reverse the Corporations United decision (to call them what they are, not what they pretended to be).  17 August 2014 (The Rabaa massacre)  The Rabaa massacre, one year later.  17 August 2014 (Michael Brown accused of stealing cigars)  Michael Brown has been accused of stealing cigars from a store shortly before he was killed. The thugs have given conflicting stories about whether his killer knew about that.  The news of this ended the temporary peace between the thugs and the people of Ferguson, as the people took this as an attempt to smear the victim.  17 August 2014 (Ferguson's Days of Unrest)  Ferguson's Days of Unrest Expose Stark Reality of a Segregated Society.  One white resident says about black drivers who get stopped: "Tires gone, lights out, no insurance, pieces of junk, that's why."  Perhaps it is true that black residents of Ferguson tend to have cars that are nearly junk, and leave things unrepaired. I wonder why. Perhaps because they don't get enough work, or their unemployment benefits were cut off, or they get paid minimum wage which is worth less and less, or they were victims of fraudulent foreclosure. Or their relatives have these problems, and they have to help their relatives rather than get a nice new car.  17 August 2014 (Obama threatens freedom of the press in the US)  James Risen is epitome of how Obama (continuing Dubya's policy) threatens freedom of the press in the US.  17 August 2014 (Yazidis)  The main group of Yazidis, on Mt Sinjar, escaped the siege of genocidal ISIS, but smaller groups caught in villages are being massacred.  17 August 2014 (Fracking under the sea)  Fracking under the sea threatens coastal ecosystems.  17 August 2014 (Threatening to jail for "liking" a Facebook post)  Malaysia demonstrated contempt for human rights by threatening to jail a citizen for three years for "liking" a Facebook post that praises Israel.  Being a used of Facebook is foolish, but expressing opinions there should not be a crime.  17 August 2014 (Facebook's filtering algorithm suppressed news about thug riot)  Algorithmic filtering can affect history, not just hide history. Facebook's filtering algorithm suppressed news about the thug riot in Ferguson until after it became national news.  17 August 2014 (UK gov't blocked publication)  The UK government has blocked publication of the report into the cause of horsemeat in the "beef", because it will point the finger at the government's cuts in inspecting food.  The deeper cause, which the report may not mention, is the EU's deregulation that makes it easy to ship meat from one company to another, in different countries, in a long sequence. Make the supply chain long enough, and there is sure to be a cheater in it at some point.  The US wants to do both of these things: undermine inspections and deregulate meat imports.  Fraud is profitable, so when business determines the laws, it often legislates for fraud.  17 August 2014 (Ferguson thugs' previous caper)  Ferguson thugs' previous caper: they arrested the wrong man, jailed him even after they became aware of this, kicked him in the head, then charged him with the crime of damaging thug department property (bleeding on their uniforms).  Maybe he didn't bleed on their uniforms at all &mdash; the thugs later said they had made it up.  These thugs committed perjury. Why are they not in prison for that?  17 August 2014 (Eyeless in Gaza)  Uri Avnery: Eyeless in Gaza.  17 August 2014 (Big spill of mine waste in Canada)  A big spill of mine waste in Canada has led to repercussions against the mine.  16 August 2014 (Criminalizing journalism)  Australia's National Security Proposals Will Criminalise Journalists, Says Union.  16 August 2014 (Australia's plan for asylum seekers)  Australia plans to tell asylum seekers they should go to Cambodia instead.  It might be a valid response, except that Cambodia treats asylum seekers almost as badly as Australia does.  16 August 2014 (Israel's "Hannibal Directive")  The widely acknowledged (though not officially) "Hannibal Directive", by which the Israeli army risks killing its own soldiers to make sure they are not taken prisoner, means that the Israeli government will kill Israelis to avoid annoying negotiations.  When you get accustomed to dehumanizing the enemy, you tend to dehumanize your friends too by force of habit.  16 August 2014 (US frackers injecting diesel)  US frackers continue injecting diesel fuel even though it is illegal.  16 August 2014 (Gouging uninsured people)  A California Hospital Charged $10,000 for a Cholesterol Test.  This is an extreme case of a standard practice of gouging people who don't have an insurance company to push for a lower price.  16 August 2014 (Israel punishes peace advocacy)  The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, which monitors violations of Palestinians' human rights and called for peace in Gaza, has been singled out for punishment by the state because of its peace advocacy.  This fits into the general pattern in Israel of repression of those that oppose the occupation. Israel boasted of being the only free society in the Middle East, but it isn't much of a free society any more.  16 August 2014 (Militarization of US thugs)  Due to militarization of US thugs, Ferguson looks like Iraq.  For US blacks, being killed by thugs is not unusual, and being harassed by thugs is an everyday occurrence.  However, while racial profiling is unfair, that's not the central issue here. It's a fact that the people killed by thugs for no reason tend to belong to certain minority groups, but that's not what makes these killings wrong. The killing of Michael Brown would have been equally wrong if he were of some other ethnic group.  The unjustified violence of thugs, exacerbated by their militarization, is the central issue.  16 August 2014 (Australia to push more into poverty)  The Australian government hopes a meaningless apology will mollify those it intends to push into poverty on the street.  16 August 2014 (Making thugs wear cameras)  Making thugs wear cameras is just part of what is needed to curb their violence.  These cameras won't stop other abuses, such as searching people without grounds.  16 August 2014 (Canada-EU free exploitation treaty)  A leak shows that the secret proposed Canada-EU free exploitation treaty, CETA, has investor-state injustice comparable to TPP and TTIP.  For instance, if a city privatizes its water, it would be unable to make the water public again.  We should not be distracted by precisely where lines are drawn. All such treaties are fundamentally inimical to democracy, and we must abolish them, not sign more.  16 August 2014 (NYC worker-owned co-ops)  New York City is directing some of its spending towards worker-owned co-ops instead of businesses that profit mainly the boss.  16 August 2014 (Gov't malware web pages)  Even if the page you visit isn't malware, various governments can replace it with malware.  16 August 2014 (Iraq's new prime minister)  Iraq has a new prime minister, Haidar al-Abadi, but is there any chance he can win support from all sectors of the country?  The US proved it is possible to buy the support Sunni clan leaders, but it's not enough to pay them for a couple of years; one needs to keep paying them permanently. That may be worth the price.  16 August 2014 (Impunity of thugs)  Michael Brown's Death Was No Anomaly. We Cannot Stay Silent.  We must somehow end the impunity of thugs that attack citizens.  16 August 2014 (Verizon harassing customers)  Verizon is harassing phone customers to make them switch from copper lines to fiber cables that will be useless in a protracted emergency.  16 August 2014 (Modi speech condemns rape in India)  Modi focused a speech on condemnation of rape in India and calling for better treatment of girls.  16 August 2014 (Urgent: Disclose frack well chemicals)  US citizens: call on the EPA to require disclosure of the chemicals used in each frack well.  16 August 2014 (Urgent: Detroit water affordability)  Everyone: call on Detroit to implement the 2005 water affordability plan and switch on everyone's water.  16 August 2014 (Privatization of NHS)  Creeping privatization of Britain's National Health Service is resulting in corruption, waste, and injuries to patients.  16 August 2014 (Bullying)  Children are more likely to encounter bullying and harm while at school than on the internet.  16 August 2014 (Soccer world cup)  Busted: the myth that winning the soccer world cup leads to some economic benefit for a country.  Even if that were true, this would be a lousy way to make most people better off, since only one country can win. There are lots of better ways to use that same amount of money for the general good.  16 August 2014 (Glacial shrinkage)  The main cause of glacial shrinkage nowadays is human activity.  Way to go, homo sap! This will lead to growing scarcity of fresh water in the areas that get their water from glacial runoff, such as California and northern India.  15 August 2014 (UK gov't blocks wind energy co-ops)  The UK government talks up community wind energy co-ops but has tightened the rules, blocking new ones.  15 August 2014 (SeaWorld agrees to some changes)  Public pressure, criticizing cruelty to whales, has made SeaWorld agree to change some practices. Will it do enough?  15 August 2014 (Ferguson thugs attacked TV crews)  How the thugs in Ferguson intentionally attacked TV crews.  15 August 2014 (Human rights activists arrested)  Azerbaijan's tyrant has arrested human rights activists.  The excuse about NGO funding has been used to suppress civil society in several other countries, most recently Russia.  15 August 2014 (New Ferguson thug commander)  A new commander convinced the thugs in Ferguson to stop attacking the protesters.  15 August 2014 ("Stand your ground" laws)  "Stand your ground" laws have lead to an increase in number of killings, and in a racially biased way.  15 August 2014 (Urgent: CEO of Market Basket)  Customers of Market Basket: demand restoration of the CEO that treated workers and customers decently.  15 August 2014 (Treaty against weapons in space)  The US continues to oppose the proposed treaty against weapons in space.  15 August 2014 (Ferguson city government)  The black residents of Ferguson report that the city government is controlled by whites that persistently oppress them.  15 August 2014 (Abbott's business adviser)  Abbott's business adviser prominently called climate science a hoax and warns of an imaginary threat of global cooling.  I suspect he is being paid somehow to do this by the coal industry. I wonder if he has ties to those suppositories of all climate folly, the Koch brothers.  15 August 2014 (Attack by thugs in Ferguson)  Thugs, some armed with assault rifles, attacked protesters and journalists in Ferguson.  The thugs fired rubber-coated steel bullets at a protester with his arms in the air, and at journalists. They arrested journalists too.  Firing tear gas canisters at people's bodies is a tactic well known from Palestine, where soldiers sometimes succeed in killing people with these "nonlethal" weapons that way. That's not how tear gas canisters are supposed to be used, but try telling thugs that.  The repression in Ferguson highlights the effect of the general militarization of US thugs since 2001.  Thugs with military weapons now create a war-zone atmosphere at protests they wish to repress.  The thug in Ferguson who arrested a reporter, and bashed his head against a car window, was wearing armor that prevented identifying him. Handy, if you want to hurt and injure people and get away with it.  These thugs are the nascent occupying army of the plutocratic state. As the state imposes more "free trade" treaties to cement the power of big business and serve the interests of the 1%, it needs to repress the people somehow. Just stopping poor and minorities from voting may not be enough.  15 August 2014 (Research ethics)  Why research ethics are necessary even in the midst of an epidemic.  15 August 2014 ("Social media")  "Social media" seem to make many people more narcissistic.  15 August 2014 (Comcast)  Comcast seems to have a systematic practice of telling customers that some repair will be gratis, then charging for it anyway &mdash; unless the customer has a recording to prove it.  15 August 2014 (Enslaved workers in Abu Dhabi)  Interviews with the enslaved foreign workers building Abu Dhabi's branches of the Louvre, the Guggenheim Museum and New York University.  14 August 2014 (Cops are the 'Terrorists')  In Many US Communities, Cops are the 'Terrorists'.  14 August 2014 (US won't make effort to prepare vegetables for school children)  The US wants school children to eat vegetables, but won't make the effort needed to prepare them to be edible.  14 August 2014 (Shipping lots of oil by train is dangerous)  Shipping lots of oil by train is dangerous even at low speed, but US railroads want the trains to travel at 60mph.  14 August 2014 (The "culture of poverty")  Poor people have cultural patterns, but the "culture of poverty" is a fabrication designed to prove that poverty is caused by bad habits.  14 August 2014 (Exposing Walmart spin about its economic power)  Exposing Walmart spin about its economic power.  14 August 2014 (Musical recordings released solely under iTune)  When a musical recording is released solely under iTunes, it is off limits to libraries&hellip; and oppressive for individuals too.  The only way you should ever accept copy of that recording is by file-sharing, so that you do not agree to their unjust contract.  14 August 2014 (NSA's automatic counterattack device)  The NSA's automatic counterattack device presumes that the NSA is intercepting all internet traffic into the US.  14 August 2014 (Comcast and Time Warner "honoring" the FCC commissioner)  Comcast and Time Warner are putting lots of money into "honoring" the FCC commissioner in charge of reviewing their merger.  To such large companies in the same field should never be allowed to merge. That ought to be a no-brainer.  14 August 2014 (Child Asylum Seekers' Rights on Nauru)  Child Asylum Seekers' Rights on Nauru 'Systematically Violated'.  14 August 2014 (We may be able to stop the TPP)  We may be able to stop the TPP, but we must reject Democratic pressure to "give Obama a victory" which would be a defeat for the American people.  14 August 2014 (Russian military vehicles seen crossing border into Ukraine)  Russian military vehicles were seen crossing the border into Ukraine.  14 August 2014 (The occupation of Ferguson)  Appeals for "calm" are not enough; the occupation of Ferguson and other parts of the US by armed thugs must be ended.  Police Brutality Must Be Punished If We Want Real Justice for Michael Brown.  We need to unmilitarize the thugs, too.  14 August 2014 (Urgent: Investigate thugs of Ferguson)  Everyone: call on the Justice Department to investigate the thugs of Ferguson.  14 August 2014 (Urgent: Avoid killing sharks)  Everyone: call on Bumble Bee to take positive action to avoid killing sharks when it catches tuna.  14 August 2014 (Urgent: Ban fracking)  US citizens: call on Congress to ban fracking.  14 August 2014 (Tyranny in Egypt backed by the West)  Egypt Is in the Grip of a Violent Tyranny &mdash; with the West's Backing.  14 August 2014 (Nitrous oxide)  Nitrous oxide, as sold on the street, is hardly dangerous at all, so why so much effort to get rid of it?  Perhaps it is unsightly, like a hungry homeless person. Cities try to ban them, too.  14 August 2014 (Syria's disconnection from internet)  Snowden says that Syria's disconnection from the internet was due to a mistake that the NSA made while trying to install spy software.  14 August 2014 (Guatemalan president hires US lobbyist)  Guatemala's president, formerly a general who implemented US-backed repression has hired a US lobbyist to get more military "aid" from the US.  14 August 2014 (Ebola virus outbreak)  The current outbreak of Ebola virus continues spreading because of fundamental problems in the medical system in Sierra Leone which result in lots of avoidable deaths from less exotic diseases.  14 August 2014 (Water vapor in the upper troposphere has increased)  Satellite observations find that the amount of water vapor in the upper troposphere has increased over 30 years, as climate models predict global heating to cause.  14 August 2014 (Urgent: Object letting company reps choose staff)  US citizens: Tell Congress you object to letting company reps choose their staff.  14 August 2014 (Putin's rebellion)  It occurs to me that Putin may have provoked the rebellion in eastern Ukraine with the goal of firing up Russians to support him while he imposes Chinese-style censorship on the internet in Russia.  14 August 2014 (Netanyahu deserves to face the International Court)  Professor Schabas, appointed to lead a UN investigation of war crimes in Gaza, has said that Netanyahu deserves to face the International Court.  The information given does not justify the conclusion that Schabas is anti-Israel, but does suggest he has a preconceived view of the issue to be investigated. I agree with view, but his having it in advance may mean the investigation is biased.  14 August 2014 (Nixon and Kissenger sabotaged a cease-fire in Vietnam)  Confirmation: Nixon and Kissenger sabotaged a cease-fire in Vietnam in order for Nixon to win the presidential election of 1968.  Whether this literally constitutes treason, or just a betrayal, I am not sure.  I've seen accusations that Reagan's men sabotaged an agreement with Iran to free the US hostages in 1980 so that he would win the presidential election that year. I don't know whether this is true, but he certainly betrayed his country later by ransoming hostages Iran-supported Lebanese kidnapers by selling arms to Iran.  14 August 2014 (Israel represses both Jews and Arabs that oppose the war)  More than ever before, Israel represses both Jews and Arabs that oppose the war.  14 August 2014 (Gaza tunnels)  Hamas has always used its tunnels against Israeli soldiers, not against civilians.  The article also mentions several Israeli claims about the tunnels that were erroneous or fabricated.  14 August 2014 (Right wing demonstrators in Israel)  Right wing demonstrators in Israel boast of killing all the children in Gaza. (That is not in fact the case, but apparently they wish it were.)  A peace demonstration was banned, but hundreds came anyway.  14 August 2014 (DEA bribed an Amtrak secretary for 20 years )  The DEA bribed an Amtrak secretary for 20 years to get passenger name records rather than try to subpoena them.  I refuse to take Amtrak because it demands passengers show ID. Please join me in taking buses that don't demand ID instead of Amtrak for the distances for which ground transport is possible.  14 August 2014 (Gaza a seaport)  Israel agreed to allow Gaza a seaport, but has violated the agreement thus far.  Maybe EU control of shipping offers a compromise to open commerce and travel by sea.  14 August 2014 (A computer system to detect people who are feeling stress)  Chinese research seeks to develop a computer system to detect people who are feeling stress, so as to arrest them.  Knowing about this system of surveillance will make some people feel stressed.  13 August 2014 (Urgent: Tighten power plant CO2 rules)  US citizens: call on the EPA to make power plant CO2 rules tighter.  13 August 2014 (Urgent: Corporate political spending rule)  US citizens: call on the SEC to adopt the rule to make publicly traded corporations declare political spending.  13 August 2014 (Urgent: Stop private prison transfers)  US citizens: call on state governors to stop transferring prisoners to private prisons out of state.  13 August 2014 (UK and US torture collusion)  The UK government quashed torture lawsuits by saying that admitting the facts would embarrass the US. Then it began lobbying the CIA to stop the US Senate from acknowledging the torture, because if it did, that would pull the rug out from under the UK's self-serving argument.  13 August 2014 (The massacre of protesters in Egypt)  Human Rights Watch accuses the Egyptian army of intentionally massacring protesting Morsi supporters.  13 August 2014 (Businesses allowed to vote)  Some Australian cities allow businesses to vote in local elections.  This is the logical progression from the Corporations United decision*. In fact, why allow mere humans to vote at all? Allowing businesses to appoint officials directly is the logical end of plutocracy.  * The organization is officially called "Citizens United", but I prefer to call it what it is rather than repeat its falsehood.  13 August 2014 (Undocumented migrants in prison)  The Obama regime is citing the supposed "threat of terrorism" as a reason to keep undocumented migrants in prison rather than release them while their cases are heard.  Because I believe in equal rights, I don't think that this is even worse for being applied to women and children. It is equally bad to do this to men.  13 August 2014 (War between Israel and Hamas a draw)  Uri Avnery: the war between Israel and Hamas has come out a draw, and now Israel has to negotiate with Hamas.  12 August 2014 (Russia's "humanitarian aid" convoy)  Ukraine says that Russia's "humanitarian aid" convoy will be allowed into Ukraine if the Red Cross inspects and approves its contents.  12 August 2014 (Authoritarian wins Turkish election)  Authoritarian Erdogan won the election for president of Turkey, by less than was expected.  12 August 2014 (Seed library)  The seed library in Pennsylvania may in fact be legal, but these laws need to be changed to protect sharing of nonpatented seeds.  12 August 2014 (Being black or Latino in the US)  In the US today, if you're black or Latino, having a thug assume you're committing a crime is a rite of passage.  12 August 2014 (CIA and NSA-funded report)  A CIA and NSA-funded company made a report claiming that al Qa'ida learned about resisting tracking from the Snowden revelations, though in fact it was developing countermeasures years before.  12 August 2014 (Curfew in Baltimore)  A curfew in Baltimore seems to presume that anyone under 16 who is out at night is being neglected by her parents.  12 August 2014 (UK welfare "reform")  The UK government is firmly determined to "reform" welfare to the point where the poor will starve, and claims that they are great for the poor.  12 August 2014 (US deaths from lack of medical care)  1.3 Americans have died per day from fighting wars, since 2001. 120 die per day from lack of medical care. Why don't the latter get as much concern?  12 August 2014 (The thug that shot Michael Brown)  The thug that shot Michael Brown seems to have fabricated a false accusation as an excuse.  Police officers are simply not credible witnesses about such events, because they are accustomed to lying in court.  Ferguson thugs shot protesters and bystanders with wooden bullets that wound people.  12 August 2014 (UK's arms exports to Israel)  The UK says it will suspend some arms exports to Israel if Israel resumes fighting in Gaza.  12 August 2014 (Man burnt alive by thugs)  At the Goldcorp (Canadian) mine in Guatemala, a local man who tried to complain was burnt alive by the company thugs.  12 August 2014 (Porpoise species facing extinction)  The smallest porpoise species, found in the Sea of California, is facing extinction due to gill netting.  12 August 2014 (Urgent: Reject 2,4-D resistant corn)  US citizens: Tell the USDA not to allow 2,4-D resistant corn.  12 August 2014 (Long spells of heat or rain)  Spells of heat or rain that lasts for weeks have become twice as common since 2000, due to measurable changes in the behavior of the jet streams.  All this is due to global heating.  12 August 2014 (Ukrainian Neo-Nazis)  Ukrainian Neo-Nazis, organized as militia units, are leading the attack against pro-Russian rebels.  12 August 2014 (Bullying)  Bullying is bullying, on the internet or off it.  Perhaps teenagers would self-harm less if our society did not make life so precarious.  12 August 2014 (Who does the US save?)  Who does the US save, and who does the US allow to be oppressed?  12 August 2014 (Over 65,000 Gazans made homeless)  More than 65,000 people in Gaza are homeless because their homes were destroyed.  12 August 2014 (Statements by Clinton and Netanyahu)  Can you tell which statements were made by Clinton and which by Netanyahu?  12 August 2014 (Making it illegal to be homeless)  No Safe Place: How [US] Cities Are Making It Illegal to be Homeless.  12 August 2014 (Iran bans sterilization)  Iran has banned sterilization in a campaign to pressure people to have more children. It will fall most heavily on those who can't afford to travel abroad for an operation.  I can understand that people would not want to have children in Iran. What if they are daughters?  12 August 2014 (Antisemitism boosted by occupation)  Israel's identification of criticism of the occupation of Palestine with antisemitism was meant to suppress the former using the odium of the latter. It worked for a while, but now it has backfired: the odium of the occupation is boosting antisemitism.  12 August 2014 (Emissions estimates for Keystone XL)  A new analysis estimates that the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline will result in 120 million tons of extra annual CO2 emissions, not merely 30 million.  This is because it would result in a lower price for oil, which would encourage users to burn oil rather than invest in alternatives.  Although this is a small fraction of what the human world emits, it is an investment in increasing the emissions, when what we need to do is invest in decreasing them. We must also end the subsidies for oil. Better an increase in price now, than a big jump in price in 5 years.  12 August 2014 (US whitewash of killings of civilians)  Amnesty International criticizes the US for whitewashing killings of Afghan civilians.  That the Taliban are even worse is no excuse, because they are no standard of comparison.  12 August 2014 (Bottle water from California)  A large part of US bottle water is shipped from California, which has a severe drought.  I just about never buy a bottle of water in the US or other countries where tap water is potable. Why pollute the environment by being a sucker?  12 August 2014 (Media coverage of climate scientists)  The tiny fraction of climate scientists who deny that human activities cause global heating report much more media coverage than the ones who agree with the consensus.  12 August 2014 (Iraq under Maliki won't work)  Obama tried persistently to unite Iraq under Maliki's government, but he has recognized that this won't work.  Kurdistan makes a much better ally, since it is a nation and has an army that will fight for something other than pay or hatred.  12 August 2014 (Striking Bangladeshi workers paid)  The Bangladeshi workers on hunger strike received their back pay.  The article does not mention one of the reasons these workers are mistreated so much: the "flexible" system of subcontracting that makes it easy to move production from one subcontractor to another. We must make the shell companies that put their names on these goods responsible for the actions of their supply chain.  11 August 2014 (Australian Liberal Party registered domain names that use "Abbott lies")  The Australian Liberal Party registered domain names that use "Abbott lies", acting like the "pregnancy counselors" that try to distract women away from abortion clinics.  11 August 2014 (Thug shot an unarmed black teenager)  A thug in St Louis shot an unarmed black teenager for no obvious reason, triggering a big protest in his neighborhood.  11 August 2014 (Indigenous women organize to fight extractive industries)  Indigenous women organize to fight extractive industries promoted by governments that have sold out.  11 August 2014 (Boycotting Israel)  Don't lump boycotting Israel together with antisemitism.  11 August 2014 (Pakistan's gov't banned an opposition protest march)  Pakistan's government has banned an opposition protest march.  11 August 2014 (UK censored a report on house prices)  The UK censored a report on house prices, apparently to cover up the effect of fracking.  The UK government is not as blatant in its support of fossil fuels as the Australian and Canadian governments, but it is persistent.  11 August 2014 (Racism in the US)  Racism still exists the US, but people grasp at straws to argue it isn't really racism.  11 August 2014 (Facebook tracks everyone's browsing through "Like" buttons)  Facebook tracks everyone's browsing through "Like" buttons. A scandal has erupted because Facebook says it will use that data to choose what ads to show people.  How Facebook uses that data is a distracting side issue. The real injustice is that Facebook (and other companies) collect this data at all. That practice should be prohibited by law.  You can protect yourself from this particular surveillance mechanism by using a browser such as  IceCat that blocks the things that do the surveillance.  11 August 2014 (New York Times recognizes that torture is really torture)  10 years later, the New York Times recognizes that torture is really torture even if committed by the US government.  11 August 2014 (All users of internet cafes to show their identity)  Russia has joined China in requiring all users of internet cafes to show their identity. This policy is part of repressing dissent.  If you are in Russia, you can help resist Putin's repression by leaving your own wifi network unencrypted.  The EFF is developing a system that allows you to have your private encrypted wifi network plus a secondary unencrypted one for anyone passing by.  I am somewhat unhappy that they call it "open", but it's a good project despite the name.  11 August 2014 (Hamas threatened to increase its ineffective rocket attacks)  Hamas threatened to increase its ineffective rocket attacks on Israel unless the siege is ended.  It suits both Hamas and Israel to treat these rocket attacks as a big danger.  11 August 2014 (Our Economic Model Is at War with Life on Earth)  Naomi Klein: 'Our Economic Model Is at War with Life on Earth'.  11 August 2014 (Besieged Yazidis escaped)  20,000 or more besieged Yazidis escaped from Isis encirclement.  It is not clear whether US attacks helped make this possible.  10 August 2014 (Urgent need for secularism)  What the world needs now is secularism, and urgently.  10 August 2014 (Obama undermines law against torture)  When Obama talks about "banning" torture, which is illegal, and fails to prosecute torturers, the effect is to undermine the law against torture and make torture a mere matter of policy.  10 August 2014 (Insecurity of Apple computers)  China has excluded some Apple computers from the list approved for government purchases, on grounds of insecurity.  This is very wise. Apple computers have no security against Apple itself.  10 August 2014 (Vicious US Christians)  Some US Christians are as vicious as ISIS.  10 August 2014 (Slot machines)  US casinos get most of their money from slot machines made so addictive and "smooth" that people can get lost in them for hours or days.  I have sometimes wanted to get lost in playing a machine. Rather than going to a casino, I played a game on a computer &mdash; that cost me nothing. Free software games are available for this.  The idea of raising money for a state by legalizing casinos and taxing them made some rational sense for the first few states to do it. People from other states came there and spent money. Now that most US states have legalized casinos, this effect has disappeared; the result is that people spend money on casinos instead of some other business that also pays taxes.  It's amazing how shortsighted politicians can be when that enables a business to make money.  10 August 2014 (Legalized marijuana)  Since Colorado legalized marijuana, the rate of car accidents has continued its general downward trend.  10 August 2014 (US "allies" funding ISIS)  ISIS gets its funding from US "allies": Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait.  This seems to have been going on for longer than the article says: it seems that some of them were behind the start of the armed uprising in Syria, back when Syrians where still holding nonviolent protests for democracy.  10 August 2014 (Attacks on medical facilities in Gaza)  Amnesty International says there is mounting evidence of intentional Israeli attacks on medical facilities and workers in Gaza.  10 August 2014 (Security vs National Security)  The US has repeatedly squandered opportunities to make the world less vulnerable to nuclear destruction.  The article has a certain one-sidedness, as is often found in articles whose main point is to criticize the US. For instance, it tries to suggest that the US was in the wrong in planning for war with Japan in 1941 (though nothing forced Japan to start that war). Japan in 1941 was in the process of conquering China by means of a stream of atrocities; that's why the US stopped selling Japan the materials Japan needed in order to continue that conquest.  10 August 2014 (Censored computing services)  Chinese companies now offer censored computing services to people outside China.  10 August 2014 (Egypt bans a political party)  Egypt banned the Muslim Brotherhood's political party.  I would hardly agree with that party on anything, but banning a party is an act of tyranny.  10 August 2014 (Urgent: Block corporate tax-deserters)  US citizens: call on Obama to block corporate tax-deserters.  10 August 2014 (Urgent: People's Climate March)  In the US: join or support the People's Climate March.  10 August 2014 (Mexico to privatize oil extraction)  Mexico has made the disastrous decision to privatize oil extraction.  If this needs "investment", I am sure the Mexican state would come out better by doing the investment itself. This sort of claim is the basis for most privatizations, and nearly all of them do harm to all but their investors.  10 August 2014 (Reactor 3 at Fukushima)  Decommissioning reactor 3 at Fukushima will be more difficult than supposed, because it appears that nearly all the fuel rods melted down.  10 August 2014 (Network neutrality violation)  The four main US ISPs are accused of violating the one network neutrality rule that remains in effect.  10 August 2014 (Ukraine missiles kill civilians)  Ukraine fired inaccurate missiles at a rebel missile launcher operating near civilians, and this killed civilians.  10 August 2014 (Drugs winding up in waterways)  Drugs that many humans take, and excrete, wind up in waterways and harm wildlife. Perhaps we should choose drugs with a view towards reducing these effects.  10 August 2014 (Airline prices)  Airline prices are falling and this will cause an increase in CO2 emissions caused by flights.  10 August 2014 (Hamas demands end of siege)  Hamas refused to extend the temporary cease fire, demanding an end to the siege of Gaza.  A siege is an act of war, just as much as firing a rocket or dropping a bomb. Declaring a free-fire zone inside Gaza and shooting at anyone who goes there is also an act of war. If Israel wants a buffer zone, it should create that buffer zone inside Israel's borders.  The tunnels built by Hamas could be used to attack civilians or soldiers, but Hamas uses them to attack soldiers. And taking soldiers prisoner is not "kidnapping". However, the rockets launched by Hamas against civilians are war crimes.  More about the dishonest terminology used by Israel and Hamas.  10 August 2014 (Bangladeshi clothing workers)  1600 Bangladeshi clothing workers occupied their factories because they have not been paid for months.  The thugs are on the company's side.  10 August 2014 (Walmart in Africa)  The US is trying to subject parts of Africa to Walmart domination.  This generally results in lower prices paid to farmers and other producers because they have to accept what Walmart is willing to pay them.  10 August 2014 (Right-wing verbal tactics)  The verbal tactics right-wing politicians use when an aggressive falsehood is caught out.  10 August 2014 (Response to Israel's aggressions)  Many Europeans are responding to Israel's repeated aggressions by hating all Jews.  Antisemitism was suppressed for decades because it was condemned by a large part of society, in response to Nazi genocide. My mother told me about the regular antisemitism she experienced in New York in the 1930s, but I have almost never encountered it. (I am Jewish by ethnicity, and the fact that I am an Atheist would not make antisemites forgive me for that.) Now it seems that suppression has ended, antisemitism has come back. Israel's actions are to blame.  It is not rational to condemn all Jews for Israeli aggression. When people with a valid cause attack an illegitimate target, it makes the situation worse. Israel's killing of Arab civilians did that, and antisemitism will do it again.  10 August 2014 (Obama defends CIA chief)  Obama Defends CIA Chief John Brennan Amid Resignation Demands.  09 August 2014 (Max Schrems fights Facebook)  Max Schrems' persistent fight against Facebook's monstrous surveillance engine.  09 August 2014 (Professors doing false research)  Temple University distanced itself from the bogus study that found false "savings" from private prisons. That's not enough &mdash; universities must not allow their professors to do false research for pay.  09 August 2014 (Opponents of abortion rights)  Even opponents of abortion rights don't really believe that abortion is murder.  They use the slogan to talk themselves into a frenzy so they can aggress against women's rights.  09 August 2014 (Smothering overprotection of children)  Americans should stop freaking out when they see children in parked cars.  The US has a general pattern of smothering overprotection of children.  It is normal for children to leave the house and play together without adults. It used to be normal in the US for children to walk some miles to school by themselves.  09 August 2014 (Malaysia flight 17 attacked by cannon fire)  Reports of evidence that Malaysia flight 17 was attacked by cannon fire from fighter planes.  I have not seen these claims anywhere else. If they are confirmed, it would change everything about the issue.  09 August 2014 (Wisconsin's supreme court)  Wisconsin's supreme court is not conservative, it's right-wing radical.  09 August 2014 (Isis is conquering parts of Kurdistan)  Isis is conquering parts of Kurdistan with the help of heavy US weapons captured from the disintegrating Iraqi army.  Who Are the Yazidis And Why Is Isis Hunting Them?  Obama announced he will launch air strikes to prevent genocide.  That is a valid reason for war, and supporting Iraq in defense makes it legal as far as I know.  I worry, however, that this US intervention will backfire just like the last one. In the long term, it would make more sense to give heavy weapons to the Kurds. They probably can be relied on not to lose those weapons to Isis.  09 August 2014 (Abortion better than a woman's suicide)  Ireland formally accepted that an abortion is better than a woman's suicide, but seems to be trying to take it back.  09 August 2014 (Hopelessness of survival after a nuclear war)  Making palpable the hopelessness of survival after a nuclear war.  What could possibly have excused dropping a nuclear weapon on Nagasaki?  09 August 2014 (Israeli troops)  Israeli troops left shit and words of hatred in Ahmed Owedat's home after destroying the appliances and stealing his life savings.  They did similar things in a girl's school while occupying it as a base to destroy houses all around.  These acts fit the general hatred of Arabs expressed by Israelis today.  09 August 2014 (Demand in China for shark's fin has crashed)  Demand in China for shark's fin has crashed, as many Chinese refuse to eat it out of concern for the danger of driving sharks to extinction.  Maybe similar education campaigns could end the demand for tiger bone and rhino horn.  09 August 2014 (Obama could save Argentina from the vultures)  Obama could save Argentina from the vultures with a simple order, but he has already capitulated to them.  07 August 2014 (Snowden allowed three more years in Russia)  Edward Snowden will be allowed to stay in Russia three more years.  I am sure he would rather be in Bolivia, but the US wants him to be in Russia.  07 August 2014 (Illegal coal mines in China)  A giant coal mine in China is illegally eating up a nature reserve.  To make sure Chinese people can't complain about this, China is imposing tight control on all Internet communications.  07 August 2014 (Wikipedia edits made by UK gov't)  The UK government edited Wikipedia to downplay cases where UK thugs shot people dead.  07 August 2014 (Walgreens to stay in the US)  Walgreens gave way to the pressure campaign and decided to keep its headquarters in Chicago.  One factor that may tend to encourage US companies to move their headquarters elsewhere is to take advantage of "investor-state" lawsuit provisions in existing and proposed free exploitation treaties.  07 August 2014 (US list of terrorist suspects)  Almost half the people in the US list of terrorist suspects have no connection to any known terrorist group.  Since that the US designates groups as "terrorist" arbitrarily, without a trial, some "known terrorist" groups may not really be terrorist groups.  07 August 2014 (US corporations planning to dodge taxes)  Dozens of major US corporations are planning to move overseas to dodge taxes.  Any politician who refuses to change laws to undo the effects of this is working for those corporations &mdash; which is treason.  07 August 2014 (CIA torture report unreadable)  The Obama regime crossed out so much text in the Senate's CIA torture report that it becomes unreadable.  Senator Feinstein threatens to punish the CIA by not publishing the report?!?  Isn't that exactly what the CIA would prefer?  If the senate is serious, it should stick an amendment into some must-pass legislation giving the senate full control over what it publishes in this report.  07 August 2014 (Kidnaped children of Argentine dissidents)  Mothers of murdered Argentine dissidents are finding some of their kidnaped grandchildren.  07 August 2014 (Death threats against Israeli dissident)  Israeli dissident Gideon Levy, who criticized the Israeli air force for callously bombing civilians, is receiving death threats from powerful right-wing politicians.  07 August 2014 (Mercury pollution)  Mercury pollution from industry and burning coal accumulates in the oceans near the surface and gradually poisons marine life.  07 August 2014 (The change in management of Market Basket supermarkets)  Workers and customers have joined to fight against the change in management of Market Basket supermarkets.  07 August 2014 (Civil war in South Sudan continues)  Civil war in South Sudan continues and aid workers are being killed.  07 August 2014 (Income Inequality Could "Capsize" the Economy)  Even Wall Street Thinks Income Inequality Could "Capsize" the Economy.  07 August 2014 (US Army Corps of Engineers agree to obey pollution laws)  The US Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to obey pollution laws with its dams.  07 August 2014 (Urgent: Do not reduce protection of manatees)  US citizens: tell the Fish and Wildlife service not to reduce protection of manatees.  07 August 2014 (40,000 Iraqis are stranded without water)  40,000 Iraqis of a minority sect are stranded without water, but face mass murder by Isis if they leave their mountain.  Mohammed said it is legitimate to lie if someone forces you to convert to some other religion. I agree: lying is less bad than killing, so when killing in self defense is justified, as in a case like this, so is lying. By this standard, the trapped Yazidis could agree to "convert", flee the area, then say they lied under coersion.  They would have to stay out of Isis's hands, however. Muslim fanatics do not apply the Golden Rule to their own fanaticism.  07 August 2014 (Australia orders dismissal of Save the Children staff)  Australia orders dismissal of Save the Children staff teaching children Australia for expressing sympathy with protesters.  07 August 2014 (US owes reparations to Guatemala's poor)  The US owes reparations to Guatemala's poor for the repression that it financed for decades.  I don't think that these reparations must obligatorily take the form of allowing Guatemalans to move to the US in large quantities. It would be fine to give them the means for a decent life at home.  07 August 2014 (Urgent: Stop opposing laws to label GMOs)  Everyone: call on Coca Cola Company to stop opposing laws to label GMOs.  07 August 2014 (Urgent: Oppose oil drilling in Arctic waters)  US citizens: oppose Obama's plan to allow oil drilling in Arctic waters.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: End coal lease give-aways)  US citizens: call on the US to stop giving out coal leases that are effectively give-aways to mining companies.  06 August 2014 (Criminalising possession of porn)  Illustrating the evil of making it a crime to possess pornography, a man in the UK was convicted of the crime of not knowing how to delete all copies of a disgusting video sent to him by a stranger.  I don't understand the pretext for banning pornography involving animals. If extreme animal rights activists demanded that, at least there would be some sense in it.  "Child pornography" should not be illegal either.  I wonder how long it will take for thugs to start carrying around kids they can fondle as they arrest people and beat them up. Then any photos of the brutality would be "child pornography", and the photographer would be sent to prison.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Block Pebble Mine)  US citizens: tell the EPA you support its decision to block Pebble Mine.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Protect wild bighorn sheep)  US citizens: call for continued protection of wild bighorn sheep from the danger of disease transmitted by domestic sheep.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Action to reduce CO2 emissions)  US citizens: tell the EPA that Americans are ready for strong action to reduce CO2 emissions.  06 August 2014 (Guantanamo prisoner approved for release)  Abu Wa'el Dhiab, a prisoner in Guantanamo, has been approved for release to Uruguay, but since that might not happen for years, he is hunger striking basically to death and suing to end force-feeding.  06 August 2014 (Market-driven world)  If you are sick of a market-driven world, maybe you still have some values that aren't aligned with plutocracy.  06 August 2014 (Right-wing militias in Ukraine)  Right-wing militias now helping Ukraine's army fight rebels might become dangerous once that is over.  06 August 2014 (Call for end to siege of Gaza)  Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson call for the UN to order an end to the siege of Gaza.  There is a 72-hour cease fire at present, but converting that into peace will be difficult.  06 August 2014 (Infectious diseases in the US)  5 infectious diseases that are more dangerous in the US than Ebola, in terms of how likely it is that you will get one and die of it.  06 August 2014 (India blocks proposed trade treaty)  India blocked a proposed trade treaty because it threatens food security for poor countries.  The argument that a "free trade" treaty would good because it "adds to the world's wealth" is fallacious even if it really does add to total wealth: these treaties, in today's plutocratic system, assure that all the increment goes to the plutocrats. It's another form of the "trickle-down" swindle.  06 August 2014 (Obama's threat to imprison Risen)  Democracy is at stake in Obama's threat to imprison reporter James Risen.  You can still sign the petition.  06 August 2014 (SWAT sent to disarm grandmother)  Why was a SWAT team sent to disarm a Texas grandmother with a shotgun?  06 August 2014 (Group makes news site delete article)  A news site indirectly owned by Comcast deleted an article about Comcast-funded astroturf organizing against network neutrality.  06 August 2014 (Russia threatens to block BBC)  Russia threatens to block the BBC web site for an interview with Siberians who wanted to march for Siberian independence.  I can understand why they don't want to be ruled by Putin, but why leave the rest of Russia behind?  06 August 2014 (Europe's forests)  Global heating is hitting Europe's forests hard.  06 August 2014 (Impossible hoops of UK "jobcenters")  Unemployed Britons describe the impossible hoops of the "jobcenters" that were set up to create excuses to punish them.  I think they would advance their rights more if they got together and held a sit-in in front of a jobcenter, demanding to be put in prison. Civil rights protesters showed their contempt for unjust law by filling the jails; why not the unemployed?  But they have to refuse to do any work while in prison that the state would profit from.  06 August 2014 (Abbott "fighting terrorism")  Abbott proposes a broad attack on human rights in Australia in the name of "fighting terrorism".  06 August 2014 (Chicken sold in UK contaminated)  Most of the chicken sold in the UK is contaminated with campylobacter, which causes stomach illness that is sometimes fatal. Hygiene standards are evidently not good enough.  Either it is the same in the US, or it would be the same if standards are lowered. This is part of the reason why the US proposal to reduce inspection standards is so bad. Only under plutocracy are such crazy "economies" proposed.  06 August 2014 (Lawsuit against Facebook)  A class-action lawsuit against Facebook for violating privacy adds up to 8 million euros.  I agree with the plaintiffs in spirit, but the victory they aim for would take the form of limiting the use of giant data bases. That isn't enough to give us privacy where we really need it. We need to prevent the accumulation of giant data bases about people.  In particular, don't be a used of Facebook at all.  06 August 2014 (Fertilizer runoff in Lake Erie)  Fertilizer runoff has led to a toxic algae bloom in Lake Erie.  The waste of fertilizer will haunt us too, as supplies of some chemical fertilizers are running out.  06 August 2014 (Seed libraries)  Libraries around the US are starting to lend traditional seeds as well as books, but Pennsylvania says it presents a danger of "terrorism".  06 August 2014 (For-profit home health care)  In the US, for-profit home health care agencies working for Medicare cost more and provide worse care.  This is natural. Their profit has to come out of the patients and the public. Privatizing a public service is nearly always harmful unless it enables the public to buy directly from a competitive market.  06 August 2014 (US inequality)  New figures from the Commerce Department show that US inequality growth is even more than was believed.  06 August 2014 (ALEC recruiting states to try to block EPA)  ALEC is recruiting states to try to block the EPA from regulating CO2 emissions from electric plants.  ALEC is funded by fossil fuel companies and the Koch brothers, and their agenda is to make us burn as much fossil fuel as possible and run at high speed into climate disaster.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Demanding an end to nuclear weapons)  US citizens: support the Marshall Islands in demanding an end to nuclear weapons.  06 August 2014 (A religious exception to laws restricting abortion)  The Satanic Temple demands a religious exception to laws restricting abortion.  06 August 2014 (US developing a palm-sized surveillance drone)  The US is developing a palm-sized surveillance drone.  06 August 2014 (Systematic Israeli lies)  Chris Hedges describes systematic Israeli lies about types of violent events he witnessed.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Protecting Puget Sound from oil tanker traffic)  US citizens: Support protecting Puget Sound from oil tanker traffic.  06 August 2014 (A cunning loanshark)  A cunning loanshark sells furniture to US soldiers at elevated prices, lending them money, then sues them in a state where they can't go, so that they always lose.  06 August 2014 (Activists report that undercover thugs harassed them)  UK activists report that undercover thugs harassed them to become informers. One says thugs threatened to prosecute her if she told about this.  06 August 2014 (Alan Gross aims to die within a year)  Alan Gross, sent by the US to try to give Cuban Jews internet access and imprisoned for it, aims to die within a year if not released.  I have little general sympathy for US meddling, which is often done with an evil intent, but Cuba's interference with people's right to communicate is wrong in any case.  06 August 2014 (How to get a good grade on US standardized tests)  The only reliable way to get a good grade on US standardized tests is to get the latest textbooks from the three publishers that make the tests.  Wealthy areas can afford to provide these books. Poor areas can't. So the tests are an excuse to call poor children stupid, and a scam to benefit those publishers.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument)  US citizens: Support extending the Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument.  06 August 2014 (Thousands of criminal convictions based on bogus "forensic analysis")  Thousands of criminal convictions were based on bogus hair comparison "forensic analysis" by done the FBI.  Reportedly other kind of forensic analysis also turned out to be bogus.  04 August 2014 (Media bias over Ukraine and Russia)  Perspectives on media bias over Ukraine and Russia.  04 August 2014 (UK gov't determined to re-privatize a railroad line)  The UK government is determined to re-privatize a railroad line that made a lot of money for the treasury.  The income undermines the government's ability to claim it can't afford programs to help the poor.  04 August 2014 (US imprisoned Yunus Rahmatullah for a decade)  The US imprisoned Yunus Rahmatullah in Afghanistan for a decade without allowing lawyers to talk to him.  04 August 2014 (Treatment of asylum seekers designed to make them suffer)  Australia's chief immigration psychiatrist says the treatment of asylum seekers is designed to make them suffer, as a form of mental torture.  And not only mental, when you consider the confiscation of medicines, the violence, and so on.  04 August 2014 (Intelligence services enjoy effective impunity)  The intelligence services, effectively a fourth branch of government, continue to enjoy effective impunity while spying on all of us.  04 August 2014 (New York's jail for minors)  New York's jail for minors is a hell of violence.  04 August 2014 (Australia's proposed austerity budget)  Australia's proposed austerity budget would hurt the poor most.  That's what it was intended to do. Tony Grabbit is evil, but not incompetent.  04 August 2014 (UK to reexamine each planned weapons sale to Israel)  The UK will reexamine each planned weapons sale to Israel to ensure they don't support attacking Gaza.  Whether this is serious, we will see by the results.  04 August 2014 (Manipulation of the public through digital media)  Getting to grips with the danger of manipulation of the public through digital media.  Using mass media to manipulate public opinion and launch wars started before the 19th century. Remember the Maine, which sunk in Havana harbor due to an internal explosion, then provided the excuse for a media frenzy that pushed the US into war with Spain.  04 August 2014 (The choice to boycott Walgreens)  Many Americans don't have the choice to boycott Walgreens, because medical plans require shopping there.  04 August 2014 (Some Facts that Poverty-Deniers Don't Want to Hear)  Some Facts that Poverty-Deniers Don't Want to Hear.  04 August 2014 (Alabama's latest attempt to close abortion clinics)  Alabama's latest attempt to close abortion clinics has been overturned by a court.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Fire CIA director Brennan)  US citizens: call on Obama to fire CIA director Brennan and CIA agents that spied on Congress, and launch an investigation to prosecute them.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Suspend executions in the US)  US citizens: call for a suspension of executions in the US.  This should be a first step towards ending the death penalty.  04 August 2014 (Health care in Republican states)  Republican-controlled states that rejected Obama's health care plan have a lot more uninsured people, and it costs them a lot of money.  A US court overturned Obama's decision to offer tax credits for signing up in these states. This is going to cause suffering for a lot of people.  Republican legislators want to make life precarious at any cost, because the plutocrats profit from the desperation of potential workers. If this causes a state deficit, they will use that as an excuse to cut some other program that helps the non-rich.  04 August 2014 (Harper gov't nastiness)  A resource for Canadians: hundreds of nasty things that the Harper government has done.  04 August 2014 (Applying for 40 jobs a month)  Unemployed And Applying for 40 Jobs a Month: If You Didn't Laugh, You'd Cry.  04 August 2014 (Green Party)  In the UK, only the Green Party is prepared to reject the idea that billionaires' wealth is good for everyone.  04 August 2014 (How Israel engineered war in Gaza)  How Israel engineered and provoked the war in Gaza.  04 August 2014 (Jury nullification)  Americans can use jury nullification to protect future Aaron Swartzes and Edward Snowdens.  It's worth a try, if you find yourself on jury duty. But we need to push for more reliable solutions too.  04 August 2014 (Libya collapsing)  Foreigners are being evacuated from Libya, which is collapsing into chaotic war.  04 August 2014 (Poultry inspection rules)  The USDA has modified a little its plan to let poultry companies inspect their own products.  It is a step in the wrong direction, and making it smaller won't make it ok.  04 August 2014 (UK trying to censor torture report)  The UK government is trying to censor the US Senate torture report when it talks about the UK's participation.  04 August 2014 (Audits of Canadian charities)  Canadian Charities Will Survive Chilling Audits Of "Political Activities".  04 August 2014 (Russia wants Apple source code)  Russia wants Apple to provide secret source code.  This would show Russia how to extract data from an iThing just as Apple does.  04 August 2014 (UK stretching immigration laws)  By Expelling Isabella Acevedo, the [UK] Home Office Tears Another Family Apart.  The UK government is stretching and even breaking its own immigration laws to deport exactly the people it should be most willing to allow to stay, for no reason except trying to prove how harsh it is to migrants.  04 August 2014 (Front for right-wing lobbyists)  An organization that pretends to represent US small business owners does right-wing lobbying for the Koch brothers and big insurance companies without telling its members.  The AARP acts similarly &mdash; it lobbies for right-wing causes that its members, who are Americans old enough to retire, might not approve of. This is why I refuse to join the AARP.  04 August 2014 (Opposition to Keystone XL)  The Keystone XL pipeline is facing increasing opposition and increasing legal defeats.  I am not convinced that Obama really has decided to block it. If he had, why hasn't he done so? I think he is waiting for 2015 to approve it.  04 August 2014 (Regenerative organic farming)  Regenerative organic farming can cut a large fraction of humanity's greenhouse has emissions.  We would have to eat much less beef. I think we would all accept that inconvenience if we understood what the alternative is.  04 August 2014 (Dissidents against war in Israel)  Dissidents opposed to the war in Israel are facing persecution at every level: mob attacks on the street, threats of punishment at school, exclusion from employment, and threats of state punishment.  It reminds me of what I've read about McCarthyism in the US.  The New York Times accepts Israeli censorship of reporting about Gaza.  Reporters in Gaza, reporting by channels that bypass Israel, can report freely as far as I know.  04 August 2014 (NY Times on shoot-down of planes)  The New York Times says that anyone who couldn't distinguish a passenger plane from a military plane was "irresponsible and stupid" and "a war criminal". Except when the person is an officer in the US Navy.  03 August 2014 (US court ruling on Argentine debt)  100 economists called on the US government to take action to thwart vultures from attacking Argentina or any other country.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Support the Stop Corporate Inversions Act)  US citizens: support the Stop Corporate Inversions Act.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Impose an end to the siege of Gaza)  US citizens: call on Kerry and Obama to impose an end to the siege of Gaza.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Support access to contraception for women)  US citizens: support access to contraception for women in the US military.  04 August 2014 (Boat people told to navigate to India)  Australian officials told the boat people, imprisoned at sea, that they would be forcibly put into lifeboats which they would then have to navigate to India.  While imprisoned on the ship, they did not get enough food.  04 August 2014 (Israel bombed another UN school full of civilians)  Israel bombed another UN school full of civilians.  04 August 2014 (Human rights lawyer writes to Obama asking for support)  Human rights lawyer Thulani Maseko writes to Obama asking for support. Maseko is in prison for criticizing the government and the courts of Swaziland.  04 August 2014 (Israel spied on Kerry's communications)  Israel spied on Kerry's communications while he was making his futile efforts to broker a cease-fire in Gaza.  Netanyahu is treating the US with overt contempt, believing he has the US government on a leash. A couple of days ago he essentially told the US, "Shut up, you have no right to question Israel's decisions." The US government does not seem to have listened.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Schedules That Work Act)  US citizens: support the Schedules That Work Act  04 August 2014 (California has declared a fire emergency)  California has declared a fire emergency, with fires now at the level usually seen only in September.  In 30 years, that will usually arrive in June, due to global heating.  04 August 2014 (The ignorance of right-wingers)  The ignorance of right-wingers knows no bounds. A language teacher in Utah was fired for writing an article about homophones.  04 August 2014 (The US empire)  How the US empire weakens the US and harms Americans.  03 August 2014 (Israel's "aim" of attack on Gaza)  Uri Avnery: Israel keeps changing the "aim" of the attack on Gaza, so there is always a reason to keep attacking.  To keep it going, the US has just sold Israel more ammunition.  The latest "war aim" is to destroy Hamas tunnels, which Israel claims are meant to attack Israeli civilians. Never mind the fact that they have only been used to attack soldiers.  It's not clear the Iron Dome rockets are effective at destroying Hamas missiles (which seem to pose little danger in any case), but they are great for making loud explosions that get Israelis scared.  Israeli civilians have talked themselves into a frenzy of fear based on a danger that is tiny. That frenzy is, in objective terms, no justification for them to inflict great harm on civilians in Gaza.  The casualties (killed and wounded) in Gaza, around 10,000 people, amount to half a percent of the population of Gaza (1.8 million). If 30,000 Israelis were casualties of Hamas attacks, Israelis would face the same level of danger as Gazans, and I'd agree they had a valid reason to be frightened.  03 August 2014 (Monsanto's attack on food safety laws)  Vandana Shiva explains Monsanto's world-wide attack on food safety laws.  03 August 2014 (Urgent: Walgreens)  In the US: call on Walgreens to remain a US company.  03 August 2014 (Tax on wealth)  The UK Labour Party is terrified that people might think it is planning to tax inherited fortunes.  That would be a tax on wealth. Taxing wealth is just what Thomas Piketty says we need to do.  03 August 2014 (The ice around Antarctica)  With the Earth's surface heating, and ice melting everywhere, it was a mystery why sea ice around Antarctica was increasing. Part of the explanation is that the increase is less than was thought.  03 August 2014 (Fracking)  In order for fracking to have a chance of leading a transition to cleaner energy, it would need a coherent plan to end use of coal and oil.  There is no such plan, because the backers of fracking don't really want to reduce fossil fuel use. They only want to extract more and faster.  This is aside from the point that fracked gas releases a lot of methane which makes its greenhouse contributions much higher.  02 August 2014 (Global heating is visible)  Global heating is visible in the change of which fish species live around Britain.  02 August 2014 (Politician claims rape accusations are a "fashion")  A Hindu-nationalist politician claims that rape accusations in India are a "fashion", in effect asserting it is unthinkable that rape could really occur in India.  02 August 2014 (Australia forced the Tamil boat people onto a plane to Nauru)  Australia forced the Tamil boat people onto a plane to Nauru with no warning and without informing their lawyers.  02 August 2014 (Staying sober under the monitoring of a sobriety bracelet)  People who committed crimes while drunk show a pretty good rate of staying sober under the monitoring of a sobriety bracelet.  This use of surveillance is legitimate because it is specifically targeted and because it is imposed after due process.  02 August 2014 (25,000 people in Detroit are cut off from water supplies)  25,000 people in Detroit are cut off from water supplies, and it is not clear that the mayor is going to treat the poor any better than the bankruptcy manager.  02 August 2014 (US denies citizenship to Muslim permanent residents)  The US denies citizenship to Muslim permanent residents and refuses to tell them why.  02 August 2014 (Urgent: oppose mergers of big companies)  US citizens: oppose mergers of big companies such as Comcast.  02 August 2014 (Hungary's government is slowly extending censorship)  Hungary's government is slowly extending censorship, much as Putin did until a couple of years ago.  02 August 2014 (Helping Companies Move Overseas To Dodge Taxes)  Wall Street Has Raked In Almost A Billion Dollars Helping Companies Move Overseas To Dodge Taxes.  02 August 2014 (72 companies have stopped funding ALEC)  72 companies have stopped funding ALEC, but ALEC still gets plenty from the Koch brothers, tobacco companies and Big Pharma.  Lots of Earth-broiling companies support ALEC.  Did Google ever stop funding ALEC?  02 August 2014 (US court demands Microsoft hand over client's emails)  A US court continues to demand that Microsoft hand over a client's emails stored in Ireland, without consulting Ireland.  Ireland could stop Microsoft from complying, if it had the guts.  02 August 2014 (New coal mine will probably kill The Great Barrier Reef)  The Great Barrier Reef is already sick, and the new coal mine that Australia plans to create will attack it in several ways, probably killing it.  02 August 2014 (US Banks still "too big to fail")  The GAO says big US banks are still "too big to fail".  02 August 2014 (Anti-gay laws in Uganda)  Uganda's latest anti-gay law was struck down as unconstitutional, but only on a technicality, and the old one that was imposed by British colonialists remains.  02 August 2014 (Unknown spider species)  The unknown spider species we are driving to extinction today might save your life if it survives. And wiping them out could make us starve.  02 August 2014 (War crimes in Gaza)  The Palestinian Authority should call on the International Criminal Court to prosecute the war crimes in Gaza.  Although Israel claims that Hamas uses UN schools for military activities, so far there is no evidence that it did so in the schools where civilians are sheltering. The UN reported finding rockets stored in UN schools that were closed and not in use.  02 August 2014 (Multiplayer video games)  The "social" aspect of multiplayer video games is an unhealthy society, totally structured to get people to play and pay.  While we have seen such things before, such as shopping malls as places to hang out, and the increasing number of holidays structured around socially-pressured gift-giving, they do involve a lot of social interaction on which no structure is imposed. This is a change for the worse; it could be producing millions of people who don't interact with their "friends" outside of the imposed structure.  02 August 2014 (UK cuts climate diplomacy budget)  The UK government, which does not want climate negotiations to succeed, has cut the budget for its climate diplomacy by 1/3 in recent years.  The UK government is working for fossil fuel companies and intends to prevent an agreement. That does not require much staff work.  02 August 2014 (Resistance to ISIS)  The inhabitants of Mosul are resisting ISIS.  02 August 2014 (Israeli artillery practices)  Israeli artillery practices are a recipe for hitting civilians.  Are the gunners sloppy and incompetent, or do they just not care about killing Arabs?  02 August 2014 (Investigation into CIA torture)  The Obama regime and CIA torturers are censoring the Senate investigation into CIA torture.  02 August 2014 (Force-feeding in Guantanamo)  Some prisoners in Guantanamo said they would accept force-feeding done in a way that doesn't amount to torture. Obama would rather torture them.  02 August 2014 (Whitewash by Yushukan war museum)  Japan's Yushukan war museum says that Japan was never an aggressor, and that Japanese troops never committed atrocities. It was always all the other side's fault.  Japan is not the only country to whitewash aggression and massacres in this way. Today Israel and the US do it. It is noteworthy how the Japanese army defined all Chinese men of military age in Nanjing as soldiers in civilian disguise; thus it can claim their execution was not a massacre. Did Bush and Obama get the idea from there?  01 August 2014 (Urgent: End bulk antibiotics use in farms)  US citizens: call on Congress to end bulk use of antibiotics in factory farms, before the resistant bacteria kill us.  01 August 2014 (Russia prohibits anonymity)  Russia has prohibited anonymous comments on web sites.  It has also imposed many other limits on Internet use, including arbitrary blocking of inconvenient web sites.  Of course, Russia is ruled by a tyrant, and this is what tyrants do. (I pity the poor fools in the Crimea that wanted to be under Putin's power &mdash; if indeed they were more than a bunch of armed gangs he had set up.)  What is more dangerous is that governments of "free" countries such as the US, France, Italy, and Finland also block web sites, and have laws such as the DMCA that lend themselves to political censorship.  A UK committee wants to ban anonymity on the internet.  01 August 2014 (Extreme weather in Siberia)  Extreme weather in Siberia has impacted salmon, causing bears to attack humans.  01 August 2014 (Defamation laws)  Zimbabwe's Constitutional Court struck down the law criminalizing defamation.  However, Cambodia is moving in the other direction.  01 August 2014 (More coral reefs damaged by Big Spill)  Scientists have found more coral reefs in the Gulf of Mexico that have been badly damaged by the Big Spill.  They say that not all reefs in the area were harmed. It makes sense that the oil was carried by currents in certain directions and others were spared. It makes for a good comparison.  01 August 2014 (US workers without sick days)  40 million US workers don't get paid sick days, and ALEC is fighting to keep it that way.  01 August 2014 (CIA spying on Senate Staffers)  CIA Admits to Spying on Senate Staffers. And breaking the security on Senate computers, too.  But worst of all is that they lied about it.  The CIA needs to be investigated by another Church Committee.  01 August 2014 (India suspends trials of GMO foods)  India has suspended trials of genetically modified foods for the sake of protecting its food security.  01 August 2014 (Lobbying against solar)  US electric companies are paying ALEC to push laws to obstruct installation of solar generation in homes and businesses.  01 August 2014 (London thug charged with murder)  An unidentified London thug will be charged with murder for a scandalous killing 9 years ago.  01 August 2014 (Massachusetts replaces "buffer zone" law)  Massachusetts has replaced its "buffer zone" law with a different way of preventing harassment of patients and doctors at abortion clinics.  01 August 2014 (Australia's prison for boat people)  Australia's prison for boat people is intended to make future boat people stay away, so it is intentionally cruel. About 1/3 of the prisoners have mental health problems.  One epileptic had seizures because the government took away her anti-seizure medicine and did not supply more. Some children are described as having given up eating because it was not worth living.  The prisons are cruel to people with non-mental illnesses, too. This article (mostly overlapping) informs us that the thugs confiscated eyeglasses and hearing aids too.  The Australian government representative was shocked people could doubt the benign intentions and good judgment of the government, which are of course beyond question.  01 August 2014 (The "public inquiry" into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko)  The "public inquiry" into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko will not really be a public inquiry. Even its conclusion will not be entirely published.  01 August 2014 (Greeks who shot immigrant workers acquitted of human trafficking)  Some of the Greeks who shot the immigrant workers whose pay they were stealing were acquitted of human trafficking.  01 August 2014 (Uganda's repressive anti-gay law)  Uganda's repressive anti-gay law is being challenged as unconstitutional.  01 August 2014 (Israel to increase its attacks on Gaza)  Israel intends to increase its attacks on Gaza, and is buying more ammunition from the US to kill more Palestinians.  01 August 2014 (Politicians want NATO to "respond" to non-armed "attacks")  Politicians want NATO to "respond" to non-armed "attacks" which might be nothing but propaganda.  If the response to a non-armed "attack" is made in kind, without arms, it does not require the formality of NATO, or any treaty. It would be nonmilitary cooperation between governments, which they can do without NATO.  It follows that this proposal is really about permitting NATO to launch a war in response to non-military action. That seems very dangerous to me.  30 July 2014 (UK proposes tax cut for the rich)  The UK's dooH niboR government is proposing a new tax cut for the rich.  It will grasp any excuse to claim it has no money for the poor, the NHS, and so on.  30 July 2014 (US-supported terrorism in Colombia)  Colombia's army and the government-supported paramilitares continue their terrorism and repression, with US support.  30 July 2014 (Corn engineered with Bt toxin)  Genetically engineered corn that makes Bt toxin has ceased to repel insect pests, in Brazil and in the US. Brazilian farmers demand compensation for the extra pesticides they had to use.  30 July 2014 (US collaboration in torture)  Yonas Fikre says the US had him arrested and tortured in the United Arab Emirates and apparently collaborated with his torturers.  It is not clear that Fikre can't return to the US. The article does not say he faced arrest (let alone torture) in the US. Perhaps therefore Sweden's decision not to grant him asylum was correct, since he can safely return to his home country.  But that doesn't excuse the US for collaborating in torture.  30 July 2014 (Malaysian Airlines flight 17)  Former US intelligence officials call on the US to show its evidence about Malaysian Airlines flight 17, or else stop claiming to be certain about what happened.  Above all they criticize the tendency to condemn Russia as if the rebels had intentionally shot down the plane (which it is clear they did not do).  30 July 2014 (UN school in Gaza bombarded again)  Israel bombarded a UN school again in Gaza, and has tried to pretend that Hamas attacked the school.  It is standard practice for the Israeli government to deny the facts to duck the blame for killing innocent Palestinians &mdash; one may as well assume such claims are false.  30 July 2014 (Australia to punish the unemployed)  Australia will punish the unemployed if they don't apply for enough jobs or if they send "unsatisfactory" applications.  If there are no jobs available in your field, you will inevitably be punished.  30 July 2014 (New Zealand's mountains)  New Zealand's mountains have lost 1/3 of their snow and ice since 1978.  30 July 2014 (Australian gov't bribery scandal)  Wikileaks reveals that the Australian government is covering up a bribery scandal by banning all public discussion of it.  30 July 2014 (Economic cost of worldwide disaster)  Delaying Climate Action Will Carry Heavy Economic Cost, White House Warns.  It's true, but the fact that one must cite economic losses as a reason to prevent worldwide disaster is a testament to plutocracy.  More explanation of the report.  30 July 2014 (What is "terrorism"?)  What is "terrorism"? Hamas uses tunnels into Israel to attack soldiers &mdash; which is war, not terrorism.  Israel bombards civilians, homes of the families of Hamas members, hospitals, and power plants &mdash; which is terrorism, not war.  With Blackouts, Food Shortages And Sewage in the Streets, Observers Say the IDF Either Targets Civilians Or Has Terrible Aim.  30 July 2014 (Unregulated "shadow banking system")  The unregulated "shadow banking system" vitiates the regulations that were intended to make banks more stable.  30 July 2014 (Spies, journalists and lawyers)  Pervasive surveillance in the US forces journalists and lawyers to use spy techniques to communicate with their source and clients.  Although the Senate is now considering a bill that would make it harder for the NSA to collect records in bulk, that would not prevent targeted investigations aimed at a journalist to find the journalist's sources. The approach of limiting access to giant digital dossiers is simply not capable of solving the problem. We must stop the creation of these dossiers.  Comparing the Senate bill with the toothless House bill.  30 July 2014 (Urgent: Tell Southwest Airlines not to gag passengers)  In the US: tell Southwest Airlines not to gag passengers.  30 July 2014 (Labeling products from Israeli colonies)  Several European countries now ask stores to label products from Israeli colonies in Palestine.  They ought to go further and ban commercial importation of all such products.  30 July 2014 (US sells coal for a pittance to mining companies)  The US sells coal for a pittance to mining companies, effectively a subsidy so they can export it to boost global heating.  Buy Low, Sell High: How Big Coal And The BLM Treat Taxpayers Like Chumps.  30 July 2014 (How Capitalism Is Cheating Young Americans)  How Capitalism Is Cheating Young Americans. (And young Europeans too.)  30 July 2014 (Israel has arrested 400 Israeli Arabs for protesting)  Israel has arrested 400 Israeli Arabs for protesting, or planning to protest, or relaying postings about a protest, or just being near a protest. Some get beaten bloody, some get interrogated without lawyers.  People who support peace are called traitors by the right-wing majority.  David Grossman (mentioned in the above article) still has hope that Israel will "grow up" as a result of this war.  Stranger things have happened, but having "the left" understand the majority right-wingers better is not the sort of progress that will help.  30 July 2014 (TaskRabbit)  If TaskRabbit Is the Future of Employment, the Employed Are Fucked.  30 July 2014 (US providing Afghan government with weapons)  The US is providing the Afghan government with more weapons than it can use, and many could fall into the hands of the Taliban.  30 July 2014 (Taxes for poor increase but decrease for wealthy)  Republicans passed a bill to let taxes for poor families increase but reduce them for fairly wealthy families.  30 July 2014 (How dangerous 5 pesticides are to endangered wildlife)  A court settlement requires the US government to investigate how dangerous 5 pesticides are to endangered wildlife.  30 July 2014 (General Mills has given Oxfam firm commitments)  General Mills has given Oxfam firm commitments to cut deforestation.  I'm generally skeptical that commitments by businesses are lip service, but if Oxfam thinks this will really solve the problem, maybe it will.  30 July 2014 (Hamas is "forcing" Israel to kill Palestinian children)  In the US mainstream media, you can get in trouble by showing too much concern for the killing of 1000 Palestinians, but it's fine to say that Hamas is "forcing" Israel to kill Palestinian children.  This is, of course, totally false. Israel could easily protect itself from the tunnels, and the rockets rarely hurt anyone.  30 July 2014 (Urgent: Stop offshore drilling licenses)  US citizens: call on the Department of the Interior to stop issuing licenses for offshore oil drilling.  30 July 2014 (Mississippi's abortion clinic)  Mississippi's attempt to close the state's only abortion clinic has been declared unconstitutional.  However, there may be more appeals.  30 July 2014 (Gaza's electric plant destroyed)  Israel destroyed Gaza's electric plant. This will make Gaza totally dependent on whatever electricity Israel chooses to supply.  30 July 2014 (Doctors banned from discussing guns)  Florida bans doctors from discussing the danger of guns with their patients.  29 July 2014 (Dating site experiment)  OkCupid did an experiment telling users they were compatible when its scores said they were not.  These pairs carried on with conversations, apparently not noticing their supposed incompatibility. I wonder how many of them formed relationships and how those worked out.  It's possible that this experiment constituted lying to the users, but I don't know whether that is true. It depends on what promises the site makes to users about how it judges compatibility, which are facts I don't know. If "flip a coin" is as good a method as its usual one, perhaps it satisfies the promises.  However, if a dating site's claim to being useful is its method for estimating people's compatibility, and that method turns out to be little better than chance, it seems to imply that the site is pointless.  More information about the experiment.  29 July 2014 (Urgent: Child refugees)  US citizens: Don't send back child refugees without hearing their cases.  29 July 2014 (Activists block train tracks)  After an oil train derailed in Washington state, activists blocked the tracks so no more could follow.  29 July 2014 (Israel's moral standards)  A former Israeli air force officer says that Israel's moral standards have collapsed. Actions that led to soul-searching 12 years ago are now done without a second thought.  29 July 2014 (Verizon "rewards" for more tracking)  Verizon offers customers "rewards" in exchange for more tracking.  This is why I think it won't achieve much to adopt a law that people "own" their personal data as property &mdash; it is too easy to convince them to sell it.  29 July 2014 (Urgent: Limit CO2 emissions)  US citizens: tell the EPA you support limiting CO2 emissions from coal power plants.  29 July 2014 (State laws promoted by ALEC)  ALEC is promoting state laws to remove all regulation from private "charter" schools and ban enrollment in Medicaid.  29 July 2014 (Religious freedom)  Why We'll Still Be Fighting About Religious Freedom 200 Years From Now!  29 July 2014 (Solitary confinement)  Solitary confinement often causes mental illness.  In addition, it must make dementia more likely, since it has been established that exercising the mind tends to delay dementia.  29 July 2014 (Diary from Gaza under bombardment)  A diary from Gaza under bombardment.  29 July 2014 (Tax-dodge haven in Gibraltar)  A Spanish union plans a protest in Gibraltar against its use as a tax-dodge haven.  I support their campaign against tax havens, but under the circumstances it can't help being confused with mere nationalism. If they could join with UK Uncut, they could separate it clearly from nationalism.  29 July 2014 (Enslavement of migrants in Qatar)  Despite a year of pressure, Qatar has made little change in its laws that more or less enslave migrant workers.  29 July 2014 (Domestic violence)  Domestic violence is a system of permanent enslavement, and the victims need special support in order to leave.  29 July 2014 (Urgent: Net neutrality public hearings)  US citizens: Call on the FCC to hold public hearings around US about net neutrality.  29 July 2014 (Urgent: James Risen)  US citizens: call on Obama and Holder not to imprison reporter James Risen.  Risen is ready to go to prison to avoid putting a whistleblower in danger. The US government is wrong to try to make this necessary.  29 July 2014 (Qatar World Cup)  Qatar World Cup: Migrants Wait a Year to Be Paid for Building Offices (for the event). The contractor went bankrupt and never paid them, so they are trapped in Qatar because they have no money to leave, and could be imprisoned because they no longer have the right to be in Qatar.  This is part of a general system that treats migrant workers so badly that some of them die from it.  You can punish the Qatari state personally by not taking flights on Qatar Airways, which is owned by the government of Qatar.  29 July 2014 (Threat to lawyers' and journalists' work)  Human Rights Watch and the ACLU say that lawyers' and journalists' work is threatened by US massive surveillance.  For the lawyers, encryption of the contents of email could be enough of a solution. However, journalists also need to protect their sources' identity, and surveillance of their communication metadata is enough to ruin that. I've stated the solution.  29 July 2014 (UK admits fracking causes damage)  The UK government admits, under pressure, that fracking causes environmental damage, but is mad to go ahead with it anyway.  29 July 2014 (Robots to care for the old and sick)  Isn't it strange that people say we need robots to care for the old and sick because there aren't enough people to do it, when so many people are unemployed?  This is prejudice and plutocracy at work, a desire to replace people with machines and leave more people destitute.  We should ban automation of many jobs, thus preserving work for people, until we institute an automatic personal income so that people don't need jobs.  29 July 2014 (Urgent: Treat domestic violence as a serious offence)  Everyone: tell the US NFL to treat domestic violence as a serious offence.  29 July 2014 (UK covered up massive losses in World War I)  The UK covered up massive losses in World War I with censorship and lies.  These losses were due to incompetent generals who lacked the moral courage to a plan when it had clearly gone wrong. With honest reporting, perhaps they would have been sacked.  29 July 2014 (The decline of wildlife)  The decline of wildlife is now causing a food scarcity which increases to war, crime and child labor.  There isn't enough Earth for so many humans and the wild world too. While we can do various things to assuage the conflict, we humans must reproduce less so that we stop overburdening our planet.  29 July 2014 (Neonicotinoid pesticides prevalent in waterways in the US)  Neonicotinoid pesticides are prevalent in waterways in the US midwest and sometimes reach toxic levels. They also persist from previous years.  29 July 2014 (Regulations for shipping crude oil by train)  Obama's proposed regulations for shipping crude oil by train are too little and too slow.  29 July 2014 (Official investigation of the Sep. 2001 terrorist attacks)  An additional reason to distrust the report of the official investigation of the September 2001 terrorist attacks is that they were based on evidence obtained by the CIA using torture.  This is in addition to the fact that the investigation was corrupted.  So please support the campaign for a proper investigation.  29 July 2014 (Mining takes precedence over human health)  A Colorado judge ruled that promotion of mining takes precedence over human health in Colorado law.  29 July 2014 (Destroying Hamas)  Destroying Hamas would make room for a more extreme replacement.  28 July 2014 (Fanatical Muslims lynch "heretics")  A mob of fanatical Muslims in Pakistan lynched a "heretical" grandmother and two of her grandchildren.  The thugs say they could not stop the mob. Will they arrest any of the murderers?  The government of Pakistan encourages this violence with its law against blasphemy, which violates basic human rights.  This stems, in turn, from the general arrogance of Islam, which we see also in the actions of ISIS.  28 July 2014 (Plans to waste unemployed people's time)  Even businesses object to plans to make unemployed people waste their time filing hopeless job applications.  28 July 2014 (Pesticide companies taint bee research)  Research on bees is tainted by involvement of pesticide companies.  The non-plutocratic way to fund this research is to tax the companies more, just as we must tax the pharma companies more and not let them fund tests of the effects of drugs.  28 July 2014 (Australia approves new coal mine)  Australia approved a new coal mine which will be the world's biggest. Thus we speed towards global disaster.  28 July 2014 (Tamil boat people brought to Australia)  Tamil boat people who were imprisoned at sea have been brought to Australia, but it is not clear how their asylum cases will be held.  In particular, it is not clear why Australia wants Indian officials to interview them.  28 July 2014 (Record temperatures in Arizona)  Arizona is hitting record temperatures, even at night.  One of the effects of greenhouse gases is to prevent the ground from cooling off at night by radiating infrared into space.  28 July 2014 (Abortion bans)  UN Warns Countries With Draconian Abortion Bans That They re Violating Human Rights.  Given the danger posed by human population increase, governments should provide abortion gratis and conveniently.  28 July 2014 (Everglades threatened)  The Everglades are now threatened by invasive plants and pests.  Has anyone noticed that global heating will drown the Everglades, over time?  28 July 2014 (Shredding environmental protections)  The World Bank proposes to shred its environmental protections by allowing governments to opt out from them.  28 July 2014 (ISIS imposes oppression of women)  ISIS has imposed Saudi-style oppression of women, ordering them to cover their faces and hands and not to travel without a man.  Women in the area oppressed by ISIS should carry guns under their mandatory loose clothing, and shoot ISIS supporters opportunistically.  28 July 2014 (Life getting more precarious)  The UN reports that life is getting more precarious around the world.  28 July 2014 (US conspiring with Yemen)  The US is conspiring with Yemen to keep Sharif Mobley disappeared in a secret location and refuse to tell his lawyers where to find him.  I expect they are torturing him too.  28 July 2014 (FBI hides its conclusions about drones)  The FBI conducted a mandatory study of how drones threaten civil liberties and privacy, and now refuses to tell the public its conclusions.  This is one more element in the US government's systematic contempt for the Constitution and human rights.  28 July 2014 (Entire Gazan neighborhoods leveled)  Israeli bombardment has leveled entire neighborhoods in Gaza.  28 July 2014 (Central American leaders meet with Obama)  Central American leaders implore Obama to spend billions to help them end gang violence, rather than on repelling the children fleeing from it.  One thing they need is to tear up the plutocratic treaty CAFTA.  28 July 2014 (US closes embassy in Libya)  The US closed its embassy in Libya due to the fighting between militias.  27 July 2014 (The practice of evidence-laundering)  The practice of evidence-laundering allows the US government to use NSA surveillance information secretly and secretly deny Americans fair trials.  27 July 2014 (Second bomber in Oklahoma City)  Was Kenneth Trentadue suspected of being the second bomber in Oklahoma City?  It may be true that someone said "suspects", plural, from confusion and that there was never video evidence of two people. People often make mistakes.  Whether or not there was a second participant in the bombing, it seems that Kenneth Trentadue was murdered in prison.  27 July 2014 (Russia is firing rockets to attack Ukraine)  The US published satellite photos with evidence that Russia is firing rockets to attack Ukraine.  27 July 2014 (The Energy-Efficient Way to Punish Putin)  The Energy-Efficient Way to Punish Putin &mdash; And Protect the Planet.  27 July 2014 (Israeli peace movement)  The Israeli peace movement is a small remnant of what it used to be, as overt racism and right-wing hatred takes over the country.  Peace campaigners face not only physical violence but also legal repression.  27 July 2014 (Assassination of Alexander Litvinenko)  The Ukraine crises convinced the UK government to stop blocking the public inquiry into Russia's assassination of Alexander Litvinenko.  However, the UK still needs a government that won't pander to anyone with money.  27 July 2014 (Global tax on wealth)  Piketty's proposal for global tax on wealth is his idea for saving the world from growing concentration of wealth that will lead either to a bloody revolution or the world of the Hunger Games.  27 July 2014 (Pakistan's biometric ID system)  Pakistan's biometric ID system oppresses most people but has not prevented false IDs.  27 July 2014 (Phillip Morris continues trying to bully Uruguay)  Phillip Morris, the tobacco company, continues trying to bully Uruguay (and by extension many other countries) into retreating from policies to discourage smoking.  This campaign is capable of killing millions of people.  The article alas spreads confusion when it uses the term "intellectual property". That term is pure confusion and should never be used. The tobacco companies use it as propaganda, and to repeat it is to support their propaganda.  27 July 2014 (Paul Ryan's poverty plan)  How Paul Ryan's poverty plan would be effective at increasing poverty.  27 July 2014 (US conscripting universities into the War on Sharing)  The US is conscripting universities into the War on Sharing.  Even if a university is unable to resist the pressure to bully its students this way, that does not excuse the university for failing to apologize and condemn the pressure.  The article repeats the enemy's propaganda term "piracy". Please don't refer to sharing by a term that means attacking ships.  27 July 2014 (Australia to escalate the War on Sharing)  Australia's wrecker government now proposes in addition to escalate the War on Sharing.  Mandatory internet filters were rejected when proposed for obscenity, but now they get another try.  27 July 2014 (Urgent: Stop listening to the Chamber of Commerce)  US citizens: tell Congress to stop listening to the Chamber of Commerce and broaden, not reduce, incentives for business whistleblowers.  27 July 2014 (Israel did not need to invade Gaza)  Israel did not need to invade Gaza and destroy the tunnels. It had many humane alternatives.  Even at its worst, an attack through the tunnels would have been tiny compared with the devastation of the bombardment of Gaza.  27 July 2014 (Prosecuted for sharing an academic article)  A student in Colombia is being prosecuted for sharing an academic article, under a law imposed on Colombia by the US.  Colombia should tear up that treaty.  27 July 2014 (TTIP will work against food safety and animal welfare)  A leak shows that TTIP will work against food safety and animal welfare by subordinating them to the convenience of companies.  TTIP stands for "This Treaty is Plutocratic". Corporations have too much power already, so any new "free trade" treaty is going in the wrong direction. We should instead cancel the existing ones.  27 July 2014 (US ranks near the bottom in energy efficiency)  The US ranks near the bottom in energy efficiency.  The funded campaign to keep use of fossil fuels as high as possible is evidently quite successful.  27 July 2014 (Urgent: Social Security offices)  US citizens: call for more Social Security offices, not fewer.  27 July 2014 (What is needed to end Gaza war)  Uri Avnery explains what is needed to end the Gaza war once and for all.  He also points out how Arab dictators' support for Israel is likely to create pressures for more extreme Islamism, a la ISIS.  27 July 2014 (ISIS blows up old mosque)  ISIS blew up an old mosque that is a major pilgrimage site. It is intolerant of all variations from its own form of Islam.  Saudi Arabia has been doing the same sort of thing.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Meat made from animals raised using antibiotics)  In the US: ask Trader Joe's to commit not to sell meat made from animals raised using antibiotics.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Protect intelligence whistleblowers)  US citizens: ask Congress to protect intelligence whistleblowers.  26 July 2014 (Republicans in the US Congress distrust climate models)  Republicans in the US Congress distrust climate models, and to make sure they can continue to do so, they voted to eliminate funding for validating climate models.  26 July 2014 (China's puppet substitute for the Panchen Lama)  Sooner or later, China's puppet substitute for the Panchen Lama will try to appoint a new Dalai Lama.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Restoring damage from the Big Spill)  US citizens: Tell the RESTORE Council to get moving on restoring the damage from the Big Spill.  26 July 2014 (NSA's cooperation with Saudi Arabia's oppression)  Describing the NSA's cooperation with Saudi Arabia's oppression.  26 July 2014 (Seven-Year Jail Term for Saudi Photographer)  Seven-Year Jail Term for Saudi Photographer. And many other journalists and dissidents.  26 July 2014 (The US west has been losing ground water fast)  In a 14 year dry spell, the US west has been losing ground water fast.  26 July 2014 (Domestic Violence)  The More Male-Dominated a Field, the Less It Cares about Domestic Violence.  26 July 2014 (Ebola infections have appeared in African cities)  People with Ebola infections have appeared in African cities.  26 July 2014 (Iran has arrested four journalists)  Iran has arrested four journalists, including three Americans, for no obvious reason.  26 July 2014 (Solar storm)  A solar storm in 2012 could have destroyed most electrical equipment on Earth, except it wasn't pointed at Earth.  We need to develop precautions, because sooner or later one will head towards us, and it could happen at any time.  26 July 2014 (Israel set the stage for wars in Gaza)  Israel set the stage for wars in Gaza by pulling out settlers and ground troops while maintaining the occupation in every other way.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Investigate Amazon)  US citizens: call on the US government to investigate Amazon for possible violations of competition law.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Keep Walgreens HQ in the US)  In the US: sign up to boycott Walgreens if it moves its HQ outside the US.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Arms embargo)  US citizens: support Amnesty International in calling for an arms embargo on Israel, Palestine and Hamas; ask US govt to stop arming Israel.  26 July 2014 (Section 702 reform)  Why Average Internet Users Should Demand Significant Section 702 Reform.  Reforming law for snooping on our internet traffic is only a part of what we need to do to prevent a society of total surveillance.  26 July 2014 (UK moving files to ODF format)  The UK has adopted a formal policy of moving files to ODF format.  26 July 2014 (Israeli reservists refuse to serve)  Over 50 Israeli Reservists Declare 'We Refuse to Serve'.  26 July 2014 (Punishment for smoking pot in NFL)  The NFL punishes players more severely for smoking pot than for domestic violence.  I don't see why the NFL has any business punishing a player for using pot. Using a performance-enhancing drug might be considered cheating, but that doesn't apply to pot.  26 July 2014 (Privatized poultry inspections)  Privatizations of poultry inspections in the UK led to widespread unsanitary conditions, so that most chicken is contaminated by bacteria that can make people sick if the chicken is not properly cooked.  So why does the US government want to follow the same path?  26 July 2014 (Using drugs to execute prisoners)  US states trying to execute prisoners using medical drugs find it often does not work as intended.  I oppose the death penalty in general for other reasons.  26 July 2014 (100 protesters shot in Nablus)  Israeli soldiers shot 100 protesters in Nablus, killing several.  26 July 2014 (The US terrorist watch list)  The US terrorist watch list now has over a million names, and the White House can add people to it wholesale.  The definition of "terrorism" is so broad and weak that the list could be full of people who were never even suspected of terrorism, only of "terrorism".  More information.  These different watchlists and their different uses raise different issues. The no-fly list is punishment without trial, and could only be sustained in the US by tying the Constitution into a pretzel. (Sad to say, the Supreme Court is full of judges willing to do that.)  Asking a foreign country to torture someone is a grave crime, which by the way Obama pretends the US has stopped doing.  Making a note to scrutinize a particular person more in ways that don't require probable cause may be legitimate.  26 July 2014 (Israel admits shelling another school)  Israel now admits it shelled another school (in use as a refugee shelter) in Gaza.  As usual, Israel says it was because some Palestinians were firing from the school. I am skeptical; I don't think they could have done that without being noticed by the UN staff.  Supposing there are Hamas fighters shooting from a school, which is a war crime, that would not mean Israel is entitled to target the school with any and all weapons. Israel would have to use methods, such as direct fire, that are not likely to stray off target to hit civilians elsewhere on the grounds.  Israel justifies attacks on hospitals and schools by claiming that Hamas has facilities near them, but Israeli army headquarters is also near a hospital.  26 July 2014 (Russian opposition leaders sentenced)  Russian opposition leaders have been sentenced to prison for the minor rioting that resulted when thugs attacked their protest.  26 July 2014 (Rumor about ISIS-ordered FGM)  There was a rumor that ISIS ordered genital mutilation for all females, but ISIS says it never did this.  I doubted the rumor, as I knew that Islam does not require FGM.  26 July 2014 (Global heating denialism methods)  An interview with Naomi Oreskes about the methods used by organized and funded global heating denialism.  26 July 2014 (Airline passenger forced to delete tweet)  A gate agent for Southwest Airlines forced a passenger to delete a tweet that called the agent "rude", on pain of missing the flight.  Airline employees have the power to kick any passenger off a flight arbitrarily &mdash; all they have to do is claim they feel threatened. This power goes to the heads of some of them.  It's the same sort of impunity that thugs enjoy.  26 July 2014 (Valuing everything in terms of money)  George Monbiot: Putting a price on natural ecosystems is nonsense because the prices are fictitious, but it serves as an excuse to destroy these systems in favor of a business "worth" more.  More deeply, valuing everything in terms of money promotes the destructive values of plutocracy.  26 July 2014 (UK cutting renewable energy subsidies)  The UK government is cutting subsidies for renewable energy so can give more to nuclear power and fossil fuels.  26 July 2014 (French law to "fight terrorism")  France has proposed a law to attack many human rights at once in the name of "fighting terrorism".  Reporters without Borders condemns it.  26 July 2014 (Network neutrality and encryption)  Glyn Moody: ISPs that want to sort traffic into fast and slow lanes might join with Big Brother to ban encryption.  25 July 2014 (Corporate front group)  The American Council on Science and Health is a corporate front group that spreads spin about scientific issues that affect business interests.  25 July 2014 (Systematic spying by UK thugs)  UK thugs systematically spied on families campaigning for justice after relatives were killed or maimed &mdash; in many cases, by thugs.  More information.  It has a certain logic. People whose relatives you've shot might be plausible nuclei for opposition and you might want to sabotage their campaigns.  25 July 2014 (Students from elite US universities)  A Yale professor reports that the dynamic of elite US universities, and the competition to gain admission to them, produces students who don't dare risk failure or stray from a narrow path. He describes this as a bad education.  25 July 2014 (Civilians in UN compound shelled)  Israel shelled civilians sheltering in a UN compound.  25 July 2014 (Study of monkeys near Fukushima)  Wild monkeys 40 miles from Fukushima have blood disorders and some radioactive cesium.  The level of cesium they have might not be enough explain their blood disorders.  25 July 2014 (Tricking people into giving fingerprints)  Texas has started asking for fingerprints from everyone that renews a driver's license.  People are not required to give all the fingerprints, but the state tricks them into thinking so.  Demanding even one fingerprint is an injustice.  25 July 2014 (Israel testing weapons in Gaza)  One of Israel's motives for war in Gaza is so it can advertise weapons exports as "field-tested".  25 July 2014 (Investing in businesses to "create" jobs)  Texas invested $200 million in businesses to "create" 1600 jobs in Texas. It turns out that some of the companies don't really exist, aren't in Texas, don't pay their taxes, etc.  As a way to boost employment, this is ineffective. As investment, it wasn't very good either; it made only a little money for the state.  Raising the minimum wage would create a lot more jobs, but that would not please the employers that want workers to be desperate.  Paul Ryan says the US government should eliminate welfare requirements and give money to states to use to help the poor. Texas will give this money to companies to "create jobs", thus ensuring that the poor gain nothing from it.  25 July 2014 (Christians' homes stolen by ISIS)  When ISIS forced Christians to leave Mosul, it stole their houses and even their portable property.  25 July 2014 (CIA torture kidnapping flights)  The European Court of Human Rights convicted Poland of aiding CIA torture kidnapping flights, and ordered payment of compensation to the victims. The court ruled that US "rendition" (kidnaping for torture) is fundamentally illegal.  Unfortunately, this won't get them out of Guantanamo prison.  These men are accused of serious crimes which merit prosecution, but they deserve a fair trial, not a Guantanamo kangaroo court.  25 July 2014 (Help negotiate)   Obama offered to help negotiate a truce between Israel and Hamas.  Either this is a sick joke on Hamas, or Obama intends to pressure Israel to let the fighting stop.  24 July 2014 (Urgent: Privacy bills)  Citizens of Massachusetts: contact specific state legislators in favor of three privacy bills. If they don't pass by July 31 they will be dead for this year.  24 July 2014 (Security clearance interviews by robots)  Oh, Great: Robots Are Set to Conduct National Security Clearance Interviews.  24 July 2014 (Surveillance cameras in San Diego)  San Diego has set up a network of state and private cameras that any thug can watch at any time.  24 July 2014 (Web sites blocked in the name of world cup)  File sharing sites that governments blocked the name of the world cup have remained blocked and will probably be blocked permanently.  This is another incidental form of oppression dealt out by the world cup.  24 July 2014 (NYC responds to thugs' killing)  New York City is moving firmly in response to the thugs' killing of Eric Garner, but not questioning the deeper policy of jailing people over any minor crime.  When legitimate work is hard to get and pays too little to live on, poor people are compelled to break laws to survive. Plutocratic government uses that as an excuse to oppress them.  The only way to reduce annoying crime and black-marketeering is to stop running the economy for the rich. Everyone who can't work should get enough aid for a decent life, and jobs should pay a living wage.  24 July 2014 (Anti-abortion activists use bogus science)  Anti-abortion activists use bogus science to claim that medical abortions are dangerous, while pushing women into amateur abortions that really are dangerous.  I don't use the term "pro-choice" because it fails to defend abortion rights firmly. I also refuse to accept the term "pro-life" that opponents of abortion chose as a way to insult us.  24 July 2014 (Moroccan women protest)  Moroccan women protested the prime minister who told them to stay home and not work.  24 July 2014 (How the US chose war after 9/11)  Jonathan Schell: how the US chose war, and declared its readiness to overthrow any government to impose plutocratic rule.  24 July 2014 (Bombing the families of Hamas members)  B'tselem, the Israeli human rights organization, explains why the homes of the families of Hamas members are not military targets, so bombing them is a war crime.  The UN also criticizes Israel's war crimes in Gaza.  Note the Israeli representative's bogus claim that those families are "human shields". That would only be true if the homes were legitimate military targets.  In addition to bombing hospitals, Israel has systematically destroyed Gaza's civil infrastructure such as water and sewage facilities.  In the village of Zanna, every house was damaged by Israeli attack.  Shooting the water tanks had no possible motive except to make civilians' lives miserable. People in Gaza can't afford to replace the water tanks; replacements may be impossible to obtain.  Perhaps Israel destroyed Zanna as preparation for declaring it a free-fire "buffer zone".  24 July 2014 (Warning from gov't whistleblower)  A government whistleblower warns that the NSA grabs massive amounts of Americans' data, including email contents, by breaking into servers and communication links outside the US.  24 July 2014 (Urgent: Protect the right to boycott)  Citizens of Illinois, Maryland and New York: oppose state bills that would attack the right to boycott Israeli institutions.  24 July 2014 (Decriminalization of sex work)  More about why HIV researchers call for decriminalization of sex work.  24 July 2014 (The road to war in Gaza)  Israel, backed by the West, responded to the Palestinian unity government with repression, which helped get the current war started.  24 July 2014 (US-subsidized destruction in Gaza)  How America Finances the Destruction in Gaza &mdash; and the Clean-Up.  24 July 2014 (Urgent: End the siege of Gaza)  Everyone: call on Obama to pressure Israel to end the siege of Gaza as part of a permanent nonaggression agreement.  It is widely noted that the rockets launched from Gaza are an act of war and a war crime. The siege is also an act of war and a war crime. Let's end them both.  24 July 2014 (An ID card to identify you as a human being)  An ID card to identify you as a human being.  24 July 2014 (Spying on Prime Minister Erdo)  Turkish thugs have been accused of illegally spying on Prime Minister Erdo an and others, using falsified papers.  24 July 2014 (Urgent: Israeli bombardment of Gaza)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to oppose the resolution that would endorse the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  24 July 2014 (The world center of global heating denialism)  Anglophone countries are the world center of global heating denialism, perhaps due to the effect of the Murdoch media.  24 July 2014 (Hamas rockets)  Hamas rockets rarely seriously injure a person, but they have acquired economic clout by causing cancellation of many international flights to Tel Aviv.  Maybe now Netanyahu will agree to end the war that he started.  24 July 2014 (Great Barrier Reef is contaminated by toxic coal dust)  The whole of the Great Barrier Reef is contaminated by toxic coal dust from Australian coal export.  24 July 2014 (MP tried to force food down a fasting Muslim's throat)  A Hindu-nationalist MP in India tried to force food down a fasting Muslim's throat.  Even if you believe the MP's claim that this was only a complaint about the bad quality of the food served, shoving it into someone's mouth is hardly justifiable.  At least he did not try to do it via a tube through the man's nose, as the US military does.  24 July 2014 (Removal of a memorial to Korean forced laborers)  Japanese officials ordered removal of a memorial to Korean forced laborers.  23 July 2014 (Tamil boat people sought for interview)  India wants to interview the Tamil boat people who are imprisoned on an Australian ship.  23 July 2014 (Australian public transit cuts)  Australia's government is cutting funds for public transit to build more roads instead.  It's a natural choice, for a government that intends to boost fossil fuel use.  23 July 2014 (Emissions from US military)  The US military is responsible for around 5% of world greenhouse gas emissions.  23 July 2014 (Idea of "type A personality")  The idea of a "type A personality", with health problems due to stress, was constructed by the tobacco industry.  23 July 2014 (History of marriage)  How opponents of same-sex marriage distort the history of marriage.  23 July 2014 (Protest against tar sands mine)  Protesters blockaded a tar sands mine in Utah.  23 July 2014 (Iran delivers on promise)  Iran has finished the promised dilution of its most enriched uranium.  23 July 2014 (Koch brothers' political spending)  The Koch brothers spend hundreds of millions to influence politics, through a maze of twisty channels all different.  23 July 2014 (US stranding Yemeni-Americans)  The US is stranding Yemeni-Americans in Yemen by confiscating their passports while they are visiting there.  Then they have to wait as much as a year before they are allowed to return to the US.  23 July 2014 (UK's contempt for the environment)  The UK government demonstrated its contempt for the environment yet again by appointing a fracking flunky to head the Environmental Agency.  22 July 2014 (Urgent: Subway staff working while sick)  US citizens: tell Subway to stop making staff work while sick and stop firing them for going to the hospital.  22 July 2014 (Urgent: Poultry inspection rules)  US citizens: Tell Secretary Vilsack to publish the proposed rule for poultry inspection, and hold hearings on it.  The very idea of a secret rule proposal is offensive.  22 July 2014 (Al Jazeera building hit)  Al Jazeera says Israeli troops fired at its building in Gaza.  22 July 2014 (UK's terrorism law targets words)  How UK's Terrorism Law Targets Words, Not Just Guns And Bombs.  22 July 2014 (UK's "emergency" surveillance law)  Two UK MPs will ask a court to reject the UK's "emergency" surveillance law.  22 July 2014 (Time Magazine on the US economy)  Time Magazine says the US economy is doing great, judging based on the rich and the fossil fuel companies.  22 July 2014 (China using fake Twitter accounts)  China is using fake Twitter accounts, masquerading as famous people, to promote its occupation of Tibet.  22 July 2014 (Hottest June on record)  June 2014 was the hottest June on record.  22 July 2014 (Beef and the carbon footprint)  Giving Up Beef Will Reduce Carbon Footprint More Than Cars, Says Expert.  22 July 2014 (Executive order to protect LGBT people)  President Obama Signs Executive Order Protecting LGBT People from Workplace Discrimination.  22 July 2014 (Violent pogroms against Arabs)  Violent pogroms against Arabs are spreading in Israel as many say they want to exterminate the inhabitants of Gaza.  22 July 2014 (Call for end to bombardment of Gaza)  Gush Shalom calls for an end to the bombardment of Gaza.  22 July 2014 (Climate models)  It turns out that climate models accurately model the rate of Earth's surface heating, when not fooled by El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a.  22 July 2014 (Omniscient state that supports the rich)  If you stand for freedom or resist the rich, you have something to fear from an omniscient state that supports the rich.  22 July 2014 (Right-Wing global heating deniers)  Some right-wing global heating deniers are driven to their delusion by an ideological opposition to using collective action to solve any problem.  Collective action through the state is also the way to stop plutocrats from pushing most people into poverty, which is another reason those plutocratist politicians hate collective action.  22 July 2014 (UK plans another attack on the natural world)  The UK plans another attack on the natural world, both wildlife and the Earth's climate, proposing a legal requirement to extract the maximum amount of fossil fuel.  22 July 2014 (High-Profile terrorist plots)  Human Rights Watch finds that most of the high-profile terrorist plots that the US prosecutes were stimulated by the US government, and the "perpetrators" were often reluctant.  The effect is systematic injustice, but it suits those that hate our freedoms and are in a position to take them away by changing our laws.  22 July 2014 (Urgent: US National Monuments)  US citizens: call on the Senate to reject Republican plans to block new US National Monuments.  22 July 2014 (Antedated "predictions")  How the Internet makes it easy to create antedated "predictions" for fraud.  22 July 2014 (Urgent: Support the Paycheck Fairness Act)  US citizens: support the Paycheck Fairness Act.  More information about it.  22 July 2014 (Coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef)  Coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef has fallen by half since the 1980s.  21 July 2014 (Israeli attacks kill 100 in one day)  Israeli attacks killed 100 Palestinians in one day, many of them civilians.  This included shelling a hospital.  Israel's tactics guarantee lots of civilian casualties. One must question whether defense against attacks that might kill a few civilians justifies a response that kills hundreds of civilians.  21 July 2014 (Looting at jetliner crash site)  Ukrainian rebels have not protected the jetliner's crash site from looting or disturbance of evidence.  I regard this as proof of guilt.  Demonstrating the effectiveness of state manipulation of the media, most Russians believe the downing of the Malaysian jet was a plot against Russia.  This is comparable to the global heating denial campaign which has convinced so many Americans to support political fantasy.  21 July 2014 (India's censorship law)  India's censorship law is being used to persecute a critic of Modi.  21 July 2014 (Google abolishes "real name" requirement)  Google has abolished the "real name" requirement for Google account.  This might mean that Google+ is acceptable to use. But I am not certain, because I don't know the answer to two follow-on questions:   What other personal data must one supply to make an account, and do they amount to identification of the user? Is it possible to make a Google account named "Rumplestiltskin358", contacting the server through Tor, and not enable Google to identify you?  Does that require running nonfree Javascript code.  Later: Google+ is useless without nonfree Javascript code, so it should not be used.  21 July 2014 (The Internet of Things)  7 Reasons Why the Internet of Things Is Doomed.  Actually, some of them are reasons why we should kill it, which do not necessarily imply it is doomed on its own.  A "smart house" project Japan is a scheme to impose total surveillance and tracking.  This demonstrates the danger inherent in such schemes.  21 July 2014 (Tobacco ads targeted at minors)  RJ Reynolds has been hit with 23 billion dollars in punitive damages for advertising designed to make minors smoke.  The article says "children", but adolescents are not children, so I won't use that word. Advertising tobacco to adolescents is arguably even worse than advertising it to children, since children are not likely to start smoking whereas adolescents may well do so.  21 July 2014 (Pressure to allow GMO farming)  Even in Isolated, Pristine Tasmania, Pressure to Allow GMO Farming.  21 July 2014 (Airline ticket purchases)  The US keeps lots of information about everyone's airline ticket purchases and appears to keep it for at least 10 years.  21 July 2014 (Urgent: Support postal banking)  US citizens: Support postal banking.  21 July 2014 (The Rising Global Movement That Calls for #noTTIP)  The Rising Global Movement That Calls for #noTTIP.  21 July 2014 (Syria calls for UK to support Assad)  Syria says it is stupid to support the rebels and calls for the UK to support Assad.  The sad thing is, that is true. When the main Syrian rebel groups joined with the Islamists, they became enemies of human rights just as much as Assad is. Here's an article that argues that Israel and Saudi Arabia have promoted the violent rebellion in Syria, even as far as directly supporting jihadis.  I wonder if Israel supports ISIS too.  21 July 2014 (State legislators that support voter-ID laws)  State legislators that support voter-ID laws show a strong statistical tendency to discriminate against Latinos.  21 July 2014 (All The Big Broadband Players Support FCC's Proposed Rules)  All The Big Broadband Players Support FCC's Proposed Rules... Which Says All You Need To Know.  21 July 2014 (Urgent: Diplomacy with Iran)  US citizens: phone your senators and urge them not to block diplomacy with Iran.  21 July 2014 (Urgent: Support the Hide No Harm Act)  US citizens: tell Congress to support the Hide No Harm Act.  21 July 2014 (Some Israelis cheer at deadly bombardment)  Some Israelis go to hills near Gaza to cheer at the deadly bombardment. A journalist suspected of not sympathizing with them was threatened with violence.  21 July 2014 (Obey the US government)  US journalist Cokie Roberts bemoans the fact that everyone around the world does not obey the US government.  I think most governments fear the US too much; they let the US pressure them into unjust plutocratic treaties.  In the 90s, when I used to listen to National Public Radio, I loathed Roberts' right-wing criticisms of right-wing "Democrat" Bill Clinton. They showed me that NPR is actually rather right-wing, contrary to the reputation it gets by contrast with the extremely right-wing commercial US media such as Faux News.  21 July 2014 (Journalist Andy Hall faces the threat of imprisonment)  Journalist Andy Hall faces the threat of imprisonment for revealing slavery in Thailand.  Making it a crime to publish an accusation of abuses is prima facie injustice and inexcusable.  21 July 2014 (UK is saving emails of lots of people)  The UK is saving emails of lots of people, without warrants, in case it might be interested in them in the future.  The R.I.P. act (for Rip Internet Privacy) was an injustice even with its previous interpretation. The UK must repeal it.  20 July 2014 (San Francisco workers threatened)  An arrogant plutocrat threatens San Francisco workers with being replaced by an oppressive computer if they demand decent wages.  In the short term, the workers should simply repeat the demand, to show they are not scared.  In the medium term, they face the threat of being replaced by computers in any case, so they should organize to prohibit that. Why should stores be allowed to replace human sales clerks with computers? It should be banned by law. Until then, I make a point of refusing to use those machines, to push back against them.  In the long term, everyone should get a guaranteed income, obtained by taxing the owners of the robots. This should perhaps be conditioned on not having children; however, anyone who adopts a child should get a big subsidy.  20 July 2014 (Wildfire in state of Washington)  A wildfire in the state of Washington has burned 340 square miles.  20 July 2014 (Israeli soldiers in Gaza)  Israeli soldiers are in streets fighting in Gaza.  Thousands of civilians are trying to flee, but no place is safe.  20 July 2014 (Decriminalization of drug use)  WHO calls for an end to treating drug users as criminals.  20 July 2014 (Malaysian plane's black box in Russia)  A Russian radio station reports that rebels sent the Malaysian plane's black box to Russia.  The "investigation" by Russia cant be trusted, but this meddling confirms it was the rebels or Russia that shot down the plane.  The article also provides evidence that Russia is firing lots of short-range missiles at Ukraine. Unlike the ineffective missiles that Hamas fires at Israeli civilians, these are a real threat to Ukrainian troops.  20 July 2014 (Urgent: Let Mohyeldin go back to Gaza)  Everyone: Call on NBC News to let Ayman Mohyeldin go back to Gaza.  20 July 2014 (Russia's paid internet propaganda)  Russia has a paid internet propaganda and troll army.  The US has one too.  The US is funding research on how to manipulate people through social networks.  20 July 2014 (The fighting in Gaza)  Uri Avnery comments on the fighting in Gaza.  20 July 2014 (Children fleeing from Central America)  Why so many children flee from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador can be traced to what the US did to those countries.  20 July 2014 ("Counter-terrorist" tactics)  "Counter-terrorist" tactics can be effective against a small underground group, but not against an insurgency with popular support.  20 July 2014 (Israel firing flechette shells)  Israeli tanks are firing flechette shells that hit everyone in a large area 300 meters by 90 meters, and using them in towns where civilians are likely to be hit.  Gazans say Israel is using some sort of poison gas.  Doctors in Gaza suspect Israel is using experimental weapons that rip human bodies to shreds.  19 July 2014 (Urgent: Protect ocelot and jaguar habitat)  US citizens: call for protection of habitat for ocelot and jaguar.  19 July 2014 (Wildfires in northern Canada)  Even northern Canada is suffering from a rash of wildfires due to unusual heat.  These fires are due to global heating, and they fuel more global heating. This is positive feedback at work.  19 July 2014 (Urgent: Oppose drilling in Arctic Ocean)  US citizens: oppose oil drilling in Arctic waters.  19 July 2014 (Thousands to march in Detroit)  Thousands to March in Detroit as 'Heartless' Water Shut-Offs Continue.  19 July 2014 (Sliding into global heating)  NOAA summarizes the continuing slide into global heating.  19 July 2014 (Nuclear weapons and climate change)  A study forecasts that 100 small nuclear weapons would cause drastic global cooling and reduce rainfall for more than a decade, as well as damaging the ozone layer.  19 July 2014 (Interview with Edward Snowden)  An interview with Edward Snowden.  A transcript.  19 July 2014 (Urgent: Diplomacy with Iran)  US citizens: Call on the Senate not to interfere with diplomacy with Iran.  19 July 2014 (Urgent: Check pipelines for leaks)  Citizens of Massachusetts: Call on the state to check for methane leaks from pipelines.  19 July 2014 (Urgent: Cut the F-35 fighter plane)  US citizens: Tell Congress to cut the F-35 fighter plane.  19 July 2014 (ISIS declares Christians second-class)  ISIS declared Christians must be second-class citizens, expressing the tyrannical nature of Islam in pure form.  19 July 2014 (Workers' safety nets)  Why employers prefer that workers have no safety net.  19 July 2014 (Pebble Mine blocked)  The EPA blocked the Pebble Mine to protect salmon.  19 July 2014 (AIDS researchers on downed flight)  The number of leading AIDS researchers killed on the downed flight was much less than previously believed.  19 July 2014 (Independent DRM-free ebooks sell more)  Independent ebooks without DRM seem to sell more copies.  That's helpful for the cause of getting rid of DRM, but since DRM is an offence against readers' freedom, if it did increase sales that would not be an excuse for it.  19 July 2014 (NY thug kills man with chokehold)  New York thugs killed a man by putting him in a chokehold. They had no reason to attack him in the first place.  19 July 2014 (Gaza free-fire zones)  Israel plans to turn a third of the area of Gaza into a free-fire zone.  This plan represents a compromise with world opinion. Left to itself, Israel's government might prefer to declare the entirety of Gaza a free-fire "buffer zone". Or you might say that it has unofficially done so.  19 July 2014 (Campaign money from prison owner)  Florida Governor Scott is raising lots of money from a private prison owner.  19 July 2014 (Passenger jet shot down)  A passenger jet was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing everyone aboard. Around 100 leading AIDS researchers were on the plane.  A leaked tape reportedly shows pro-Russian rebels in the Ukraine shot down the jetliner, thinking they had attacked a military transport plane.  This sort of thing is what happens in war. US drone attacks are called "surgical strikes", but they often do the military equivalent of amputating the wrong leg. A US ship shot down an Iranian jetliner, also by mistake. Israeli bombs in Gaza are supposedly aimed at "terrorists" but many hit schools, hospitals, wells and homes.  However, when Russia handed high altitude SAMs to rebels without rigid checklists, it made this sort of accident rather likely.  A reporter resigned from Russia Today to protest its absurd claims that Ukraine fired the missile.  19 July 2014 (Obama approves injuring whales)  Obama approved the plan to injure 100,000 whales and dolphins to find more undersea oil that we can't ever dare extract.  19 July 2014 (Ethiopia to imprison dissidents)  Ethiopia plans to imprison some dissidents on bogus charges of "terrorism".  What the US and UK do, other countries imitate.  19 July 2014 (Niger activists face charges)  Niger activists opposed to a secret uranium mining deal with France face charges for holding a press conference.  19 July 2014 (DRIP surveillance law)  The Open Rights Group will challenge the new DRIP surveillance law in court.  19 July 2014 (Forcing EU to accept Tar Sands Oil)  US Accused of Forcing EU to Accept Tar Sands Oil.  19 July 2014 (School nutrition standards)  The Food Industry Lobby Groups Behind the New School Nutrition Standards.  19 July 2014 (Nurse's refusal to force feed)  What convinced the Guantanamo nurse that force feeding is wrong.  18 July 2014 (A camera in every bathroom)  Blanket digital surveillance is a start. But how about a camera in every bathroom?  18 July 2014 (UN has condemned massive surveillance)  The UN has condemned massive surveillance as a violation of human rights.  This includes data retention such as the UK is in the process of reimposing.  18 July 2014 (Urgent: Make Detroit turn the water back on)  US citizens: Tell Obama to make Detroit turn the water back on.  18 July 2014 (Urgent: Publish the composition of the fracking fluid)  US citizens: call for a requirement for fracking companies to publish the composition of the fracking fluid.  18 July 2014 (Israel's army has attacked Gaza)  Israel's army has attacked Gaza. This included bombardment of a hospital.  Israeli accusations that Hamas stores arms in civilian buildings were proved partly valid: the UNRWA found missiles in a disused school building.  Whether they store arms in civilian buildings that are actually in use is not proven.  18 July 2014 (The secret US prison at Bagram)  In the secret US prison at Bagram, the prisoners frequently have to go on hunger strike to get clean water to drink or to see the ICRC.  18 July 2014 (Your portable tracking and surveillance device)  Your portable tracking and surveillance device can now also inform about changes in your behavior pattern.  18 July 2014 (How America Fails the Rule-of-Law Test)  How America Fails the Rule-of-Law Test.  18 July 2014 (Urgent: Do not let Israel bomb the Wafa rehabilitation hospital)  Everyone: call on Obama not to let Israel bomb the Wafa rehabilitation hospital.  18 July 2014 (US allowed monopolies)  Since Reagan, the US has allowed monopolies or oligopolies to spread across the range of businesses, subjecting Americans to unchecked power of businesses.  This was done in the name of "free markets", but really it was "laissez faire". Due to the inherent instability of the free market, removal of the regulations that protected it allowed it to be converted into something more like feudalism.  18 July 2014 (Campaigning against TTIP)  Campaigning against TTIP, This Treaty Is Plutocratic, another instance of the oppression of the TPP.  18 July 2014 (Efficiencies in agriculture)  Efficiencies in agriculture could in principle feed billions more people. But the total meat production would have to go down pretty far.  Introducing efficiency into agriculture is much more easily said than done, and global heating will interfere greatly as it means that weather changes from year to year and the proper agricultural methods for a given area cannot be predicted.  17 July 2014 (NBC yanks Ayman Mohyeldin)  NBC yanked correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin out of Gaza because he did a good job of covering the main effect of Israeli bombing.  17 July 2014 (Censorship in Brazil)  Brazil allows people to censor all publication about them, and many biographies have been banned. A bill proposes to correct this.  17 July 2014 (Municipal broadband)  The House of Representatives passed a bill that would stop the FCC from making municipal broadband legal.  17 July 2014 (Syrian girls forced to marry)  Syrian mothers force their daughters to marry, as young as 13, fearing that they will otherwise be raped. One said she expected her male relatives to murder the daughter if she is raped.  Rape is common in war, but Arab culture converts rape into a sentence of death. What barbarism! Having daughters in such a society should be considered committing a crime against them.  17 July 2014 (RIAA shuts down radio archive)  The RIAA shut down a radio archive that has operated almost 20 years.  I hope people set it up again in some other country.  17 July 2014 (Censorship in France)  Censorship in France: a blogger has been fined for publishing a negative opinion of a restaurant.  17 July 2014 (Hamas and Islamic Jihad offer truce)  Reportedly Hamas and Islamic Jihad have offered a 10-year truce in exchange for Israel's ending the siege of Gaza and ending its isolation.  These terms seem reasonable to me. Most of the issues in dispute between Israel and Palestine are left out, which is appropriate since this proposes a truce rather than a full settlement.  17 July 2014 (Nurse refuses to force-feed prisoners)  A military nurse at Guantanamo has refused to participate in force-feeding on the grounds that it is inhumane.  I expect the Obama regime to repress this nurse.  17 July 2014 (Republicans guard Hobby Lobby)  Republicans blocked the bill to correct the Hobby Lobby decision.  17 July 2014 (Israel attacking wells and sewers)   Israel is attacking wells and sewage systems in Gaza.  17 July 2014 (Netanyahu rejects peace)  Netanyahu stated publicly that he will never permit a Palestinian state to function.  An Obama representative rebuked Israel for maintaining the occupation of Palestine and rejecting peace.  It's a small sign of the courage that could have a chance of making Israel agree to peace.  17 July 2014 (Supposed cease-fire with Hamas)  Hamas says that Egypt and Israel did not discuss the supposed cease-fire with Hamas before announcing it.  17 July 2014 (Left-wing terrorist captured)  One of the few left-wing terrorists in Greece was captured, but the right-wing terrorists of Golden Dawn are still rampant, and the boot of the banks is still on Greece's neck.  17 July 2014 (Solitary for having Facebook page)  A prisoner in New Mexico is threatened with 90 days in solitary confinement for having a Facebook page.  I think being a used of Facebook is punishment enough.  17 July 2014 (Australia repeals carbon tax)  Australia has repealed its carbon tax, cementing a plan that will kill tens or hundreds of millions of people.  17 July 2014 (Plans to imprison journalists)  Australia's right-wing government plans to imprison journalists for publishing what whistleblowers report about spying on the public.  These journalists are, of course, the ones who have the "sense of responsibility" that Abbott says journalists should have.  The prohibition is so sweeping that almost any reporting about a secret government action could be covered. For instance, when dissidents identify their lovers as undercover thugs, they could be imprisoned.  17 July 2014 (Peace demonstrators attacked)  Peace demonstrators in Tel Aviv were attacked by right-wing hate protesters.  16 July 2014 (US border patrol thugs brutalize people)  US border patrol thugs brutalize people at will for grudges, and they are spreading their power to a ever further from the borders.  Don't forget how they beat up Peter Watts, then prosecuted him for not obeying fast enough.  That thug should be in prison.  16 July 2014 (Immigrant activist Jose Antonio Vargas was arrested)  Immigrant activist journalist Jose Antonio Vargas was arrested when he tried to fly out of a US city near the border with Mexico,  Vargas came to the US from the Philippines as a child, and found out many years later that he did not have permission to reside in the US. I don't believe that countries are obliged to admit everyone that wants to move to them, but people who came as children &mdash; before they were responsible &mdash; and remained for many years should be allowed to stay.  16 July 2014 (The west's foreign aid to Africa)  The west's foreign aid to Africa is less than what the west takes out of Africa.  16 July 2014 (Overprotectiveness is stunting mental growth)  Overprotectiveness is stunting the mental growth of a generation children &mdash; in particular, denying them contact with nature.  The article refers to the UK but I have seen similar attitudes in the US.  16 July 2014 (Bill Clinton's deregulation of banks)  Too-big-to-fail banks exist because of Bill Clinton's deregulation of banks, and their incomprehensible maneuvers are also permitted due to his deregulation of banks.  Hillary Clinton is in the same camp; she works for the plutocrats.  16 July 2014 (Obama's right-wing nature)  Contrast with Elizabeth Warren helps Democrats see Obama's right-wing nature.  15 July 2014 (How World Bank, IMF and WTO combined to wreck countries' economies)  Joseph Stiglitz explains how the World Bank, IMF and WTO combined in the 90s to wreck countries' economies, impoverish most people, and transfer their wealth to the international elite.  Clearly this continues in recent times, as can be seen in austerity in Europe.  Ukraine is now on the menu.  RT has an obvious slant which comes from Putin, but Michael Hudson is a western economist who accepted this opportunity to communicate to the public.  15 July 2014 (US government aims to be omniscient and omnipotent)  The US government aims to be omniscient and omnipotent.  This makes its unquestioning supporters comparable to theocrats.  15 July 2014 (Urgent: Remove all US troops from Iraq)  US citizens: phone your congresscitter to support HCR 105 to remove all US troops from Iraq by the end of the year.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  15 July 2014 (US government has too few meat inspectors)  The US government has too few meat inspectors, as part of the cockeyed plan to let companies inspect themselves.  15 July 2014 (What the World Cup Can Teach Progressives About Corruption)  What the World Cup Can Teach Progressives About Corruption.  15 July 2014 (Israel accepted a ceasefire proposed by Egypt)  Israel accepted a ceasefire proposed by Egypt, but Hamas rejected it.  Both Hamas and Israel had reasons to want some inconclusive fighting in Gaza Apparently Israel has had enough fighting to achieve its aims, while Hamas has not.  15 July 2014 (US companies must hand over foreign data to US courts)  The Obama regime argues in court that US companies must hand over foreign data to US courts regardless of foreign laws.  15 July 2014 (UK's NHS is grudgingly rationing)  The UK's NHS is grudgingly rationing out hip replacement operations. I suppose this is because of the shortage of funds, by which the right wing want to make it so bad people will accept privatization.  15 July 2014 (Citigroup will have to pay 7 billion dollars)  Citigroup will have to pay 7 billion dollars for misleading investors, but it's not enough to discourage a repeat, and the executives responsible won't be punished.  15 July 2014 (Non-star writers are paid very little)  Non-star writers are paid very little by the existing copyright-based publishing system. In the UK, the median income for working authors is a pitiful 17,000 or 18,000 dollars a year.  The existing copyright-based system mainly supports the publishing companies as well as the stars that have clout with them.  15 July 2014 (Abstinence-based sex-non-education)  Abstinence-based sex-non-education is telling lies to keep virgins ill-informed; it puts them in danger.  Les Liaisons Dangereuses described the results of this in 1782, so there is no excuse for ignorance.  15 July 2014 (Florida's congressional districts)  Florida's Republicans drew congressional districts illegally to favor Republican candidates, but they hope it is too late to fix the problem for this year.  15 July 2014 (Ban on styrofoam food containers)  Washington DC has banned styrofoam containers for food and drinks.  As usual, plastic companies lobbied against this step forward. You would think that some stockholders would be wise enough to say, "People will always want plastic, and we can go along with selling it over a longer period of time to keep our rivers and seas clean." I suspect that the corporation structure systematically leads executives to be extremists: to demand to maximize their profits no matter what the cost to society.  Perhaps some reorganization of the structure of a corporation could alter that tendency. That would a great thing.  15 July 2014 (The Citibank payment)  The Citibank payment is peanuts compared to what it received in bailout funds.  15 July 2014 (Australian prison ship)  Australia is holding a boatful of asylum seekers in prison on a ship.  15 July 2014 (Artist arrested for distributing art)  A Japanese artist has been arrested for distributing art: a 3D printer model for a boat designed from her vagina. She has campaigned for years to end the taboo on the image and even the word for "vagina". I think sexual taboos, which censorship preserves, are the cause of many sexual obsessions and hatreds.  15 July 2014 (UK CO2 emission reduction targets)  The UK government still officially has carbon emission reduction targets, but has ensured it will not meet them.  15 July 2014 (Wild cheetahs being wiped out)  Wild cheetahs are being wiped out by taking the cubs for pets.  15 July 2014 (Armenian former soldier in Moscow)  An interview with an Armenian former soldier who volunteered in Moscow to go to fight for the pro-Russian side in Ukraine.  15 July 2014 ("Grass roots" support from Gates)  How Bill Gates's money was used to fund and organize "grass roots" support for the Common Core.  This makes me think of how Tea Party "grass roots" groups got funding from rich sponsors.  15 July 2014 (Secret trial in China)  Two westerners face a secret trial in China.  Think of this when the UK talks about secret trials.  15 July 2014 (Half of children in India stunted)  Around half the children in India are stunted, as if they did not get enough food, because of exposure to germs from human excrement.  15 July 2014 (Nuclear weapons and global heating)  Nuclear weapons relate to global heating in a number of ways.  15 July 2014 (Walmart's Food Stamp Scheme)  Walmart's Food Stamp Scheme.  15 July 2014 (South Africa on the verge of adopting a state secrecy bill)  South Africa is on the verge of adopting a state secrecy bill that would force journalists to name their sources, and imprison whistleblowers. Following the unjust lead of the US.  15 July 2014 (Soccer world cup)  The soccer world cup will leave Brazil saddled with a debt of perhaps 14 billion dollars.  The world cup of soccer should no longer be given a tax exemption.  I am not sure that change is sufficient to make the world cup cease to damage the host country. If you live in Canada, Mexico, Colombia, the US or Morocco, I urge you to campaign against your country's bid to hold the 2026 world cup.  15 July 2014 (What the US has lost since September 2001)  What the US has lost since September 2001.  15 July 2014 (Israeli bombing in Gaza)  Israeli bombing in Gaza has destroyed or damaged almost 1000 houses.  15 July 2014 (UK spy agencies have repeatedly bugged elected officials)  UK spy agencies have repeatedly bugged elected officials.  They also have a big catalog of tools for distorting and sabotaging public activity on the internet.  15 July 2014 (Three Israelis have been charged)  Three Israelis have been charged with kidnaping and killing an Arab teenager.  This is as it should be, but it is the exception. Israelis kill many Palestinians every year, and almost always have some sort of official cover that gives them impunity.  15 July 2014 (Unions correlate with high productivity)  In advanced countries, with the exception of the US, strong unions correlate with high productivity.  So don't believe the executives when they claim that unions destroy productivity.  15 July 2014 (Missouri plans to execute a man)  Missouri plans to execute a man convicted of murder disregarding evidence that he was probably innocent.  14 July 2014 (Hillary's Candid Motto)  Hillary's Candid Motto for Democratic Party: "Represent Banks".  14 July 2014 (Urgent: Reject "investor-state" provisions)  US citizens: tell the US Trade Representative to reject "investor-state" provisions in treaties.  14 July 2014 (UK accesses records of medical visits)  The UK accesses records of medical visits to find illegal immigrants.  14 July 2014 (Drones in use for private spying)  Drones are in use for private spying on behalf of idiotically jealous spouses.  On occasion, these uses achieve a positive result, but I don't think they should be permitted loosely.  14 July 2014 (Attack on synagogue in Paris)  Protesters from a march in Paris, condemning Israel's bombing of Gaza, tried to attack a synagogue.  The people in the synagogue are not the ones launching the attack. They may not even support it. The standard Israeli way of dismissing all criticism of its occupation policies is to call it "antisemitism". Apparently these protesters really are antisemitic, but their bad example will help Israel label all of us as "antisemitic".  There is a substantial amount of antisemitism in France among the right wing.  14 July 2014 (Frequency of "natural" disasters)  "Natural" disasters happen 5 times as often as they did in the 1970s, because now they are mainly artificial.  14 July 2014 ("No fly" list "state secrets")  Obama is trying to use the "state secrets" privilege to quash the case of a man who is suing to get off the "no fly" list.  The "no fly" list is punishment without trial, obviously unconstitutional, but we can't count on the pro-authoritarian US Supreme Court to care about this.  14 July 2014 (The right to die)  Jo Beecham is dying of cancer, but has gone to great lengths to prepare to commit suicide without help rather than be helplessly subject to a medical system that will refuse to let her escape short of death.  14 July 2014 (Blackmail by tobacco company)  British American Tobacco has tried to use its giant market power to blackmail a Ugandan MP who has sponsored a European-style bill to discourage smoking.  This sort of blackmail is common, and it is one reason we need to break up large companies. If BAT were replaced by 50 companies, and the biggest of them were 5% the size of BAT, they would not have this power.  14 July 2014 (Urgent: Clean Energy Victory Bonds)  US citizens: Support the bill to authorize Clean Energy Victory Bonds.  Raising taxes on the rich would be better than borrowing money, but either one is a lot better than failing to promote clean energy.  14 July 2014 (Urgent: Oppose whaling)  US citizens: call on the US government to firmly oppose whaling.  14 July 2014 (Market forces rule western democracies)  WikiLeaks has shown us that western democracies are now ruled by market forces that debase the very notion of freedom.  14 July 2014 (E-cigarettes)  Do e-cigarettes lead people away from smoking, or are they a new way to get teenagers hooked?  Perhaps they should be available only by prescription, to smokers who want to quit.  14 July 2014 (UK surveillance bill)  The UK's surveillance bill threatens to punish companies world-wide if they do not obey UK surveillance orders. And it requires some web sites to track their users.  14 July 2014 (Haiti's cardinal condemns voodoo)  Haiti's cardinal condemned Voodoo, saying that that religion distracts believers from real solutions to their problems.  Religion generally tends to do that, but I am skeptical of the claim that belief in Voodoo is what typically leads poor Haitians not to use the services of doctors or lawyers. I suspect that poverty is responsible for that, and they turn to Voodoo as an affordable substitute.  14 July 2014 (Islamists in Libya on offensive)  Islamists in Libya have gone on the offensive.  14 July 2014 (The world's global problems)  An analysis of the development of the world's global problems since 1945.  14 July 2014 (Software patent war)  The software patent war has extended to data centers.  14 July 2014 (Israel kills 50 more Palestinians)  Israel killed 50 more Palestinians in Gaza, including 22 from one family.  Both Israel and Hamas desire fighting in Gaza for political reasons, expecting the situation to be unchanged when the fighting stops (except for the casualties).  14 July 2014 (Hachette put itself at Amazon's mercy)  Hachette put itself at Amazon's mercy by insisting on Amazon DRM for ebooks.  14 July 2014 (The right-wing undermining of Britain's NHS)  The right-wing undermining of Britain's NHS is increasing the time it takes for ambulances to reach people.  The UK needs to increase taxes on the rich and on businesses so it can spend enough on the NHS.  14 July 2014 (The Iron Dome missile interceptor)  Ted Postol says that the Iron Dome missile interceptor nearly always fails to destroy the missile's warhead.  14 July 2014 (Republicans allowed poor person to speak about poverty)  Republicans finally allowed an actual poor person to speak about poverty but could not accept what she said.  14 July 2014 (Urgent: Children that arrive in the US alone)  US citizens: remind Obama that children that arrive in the US alone are often valid refugees.  14 July 2014 (Sentenced to prison for photographing protest)  Mary Anne Grady Flores has been sentenced to a year in prison for photographing a protest against drones at Hancock Air Base.  The US government concocts all sorts of excuses to quash dissent.  14 July 2014 (Workers punished for spending over 6 minutes a day in the toilet)  In the US, workers are punished for spending over 6 minutes a day in the toilet.  14 July 2014 (Big-Labor Strikes and Low-Wage Struggles Jockey for Future)  In UK, Big-Labor Strikes and Low-Wage Struggles Jockey for Future.  14 July 2014 (Reagan's destruction of US antitrust)  Reagan's destruction of US antitrust law paved the way for consolidation in every industry, which transfers wealth to the new monopolies from everyone else.  14 July 2014 (The state can order a suspect to decrypt files on his computer)  In a dangerous decision, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that the state can order a suspect to decrypt files on his computer.  14 July 2014 (California highway thug beat up a homeless woman)  A California highway thug beat up a homeless woman who was walking by the side of a highway, but was recorded on video by a passing citizen.  It is true we don't know what they said to each other. So ask yourself, can you imagine anything she might possibly have said that would give a thug a valid reason to beat her up? The thug may be asking himself the same question.  If you want to view the video, you can access it without free software by running the youtube-dl script with http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-J-yVKxXrY as argument.  Warning: viewing that video on Youtube in the usual way entails running either Flash Player or nonfree Javascript code.  14 July 2014 (Tepco continues building the "ice wall")  Tepco continues building the "ice wall" to keep ground water away from the ruined Fukushima nuclear plants, despite various problems.  What I don't understand is why they want to use this untried method, rather than building a pair of solid concrete walls with a replaceable plastic filler between them.  13 July 2014 (Spying via an iThing feature)  China is concerned about spying via an iThing feature that finds locations that a person often goes to.  14 July 2014 (Tor)  Why you should use Tor.  13 July 2014 (UK role in US torture flights)  The UK government is looking closely at some documents about its participation in US torture flights.  13 July 2014 (Russia's new Internet law)  Russia has adopted a law requiring web sites that Russians use to keep data about Russians in Russia.  This will make their data safe from spying by the US, but easily available for spying by Russia.  If this law applied only to only to stores and such, it might be a net improvement for Russians. However, blocking Russians from communicating through a foreign web site is oppressive.  An ethical communications system does not insist that people give their real names or their real locations. Such a system may not know if you're in Russia.  13 July 2014 (Desmond Tutu on the right to die)  Desmond Tutu spoke up for the right to assistance in dying.  The bill being discussed is a step forward, but inadequate, because it is limited to people who probably will suffer for no more than 6 more months even without help. People condemned to decades of boring helplessness should also have this right.  13 July 2014 (Marshall Islands vulnerable)  From the Marshall Islands: Why the next climate treaty is vital for my country to survive.  13 July 2014 (Contraceptive implant)  A future contraceptive implant could last for 16 years.  I don't see a tremendous benefit in being able to turn it on and off without removing it &mdash; how often would you want to do that? I expect most women will want to use contraception until they decide to have children, have some, then use contraception for the rest of their fertility (or get sterilized). The easy way to space their children would be with shorter-term contraception, perhaps one-year implants. This way, the long-term implant would only have to be removed once, which it requires anyway.  What worries me is that they might design it to require nonfree software to communicate with it.  13 July 2014 (Tax-dodging in Luxembourg)  Luxembourg is Europe's biggest tax-dodger enabler, and Juncker, the new head of the European Commission, worked hard to make it so.  As president, he will have the power to sabotage the commission's investigation into what he set up.  13 July 2014 (Americans using less gasoline)  Americans are using less gasoline, so the US government wants to fund highways from sources other than the gasoline tax.  It is good that we are driving less, and good that cars are more efficient. We should raise the gasoline tax rate to give Americans even more incentive to drive less and use more efficient cars. And we can mostly stop building new highways (though the old ones need proper maintenance).  13 July 2014 (NY Times continues boosting wars)  The New York Times continues boosting wars, despite claiming it has learned its lesson from the disastrous results of boosting Dubya's conquest of Iraq.  13 July 2014 (Urgent: Respect for freedom of press)  US citizens: Tell Obama, respect freedom of the press: don't jail James Risen.  13 July 2014 (Urgent: Oppose CISA)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to oppose CISA, the new and nastier version of CISPA.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  13 July 2014 (US thugs given impunity)  The US Supreme Court has made and approved a long string of decisions allowing thugs to do almost anything with impunity.  This includes the ruling that the president can have anyone imprisoned without trial by calling that person a "terrorist suspect".  The recent decision that they can't search arrested people's phones and computers without a warrant is an exception, but one exception isn't enough.  Since "drug-sniffing" dogs are mentioned, I should point out that a dog can easily learn to react the same way to a cue from its handler as it does to the smell of drugs. Then it can give the handler an excuse to search whoever the handler wants to search.  13 July 2014 (Honduran minors fleeing to US)  The biggest origin of minors trying to enter the US without visas is Honduras; they are driven by the effects of the US-supported coup.  13 July 2014 (Israeli drone attack)  An Israeli drone attack targeted a building which was a residence for disabled people. Some were killed.  The family home of an enemy fighter is not a valid military target either. A large fraction of Israelis are military reservists; does that make their family homes legitimate targets for missiles?  13 July 2014 (NSA records 80% of all phone calls)  William Binney says the NSA records at least 80% of all phone calls, and lies about it.  13 July 2014 (Geoengineering schemes)  One weakness in most geoengineering schemes intended to counter greenhouse heating is that their effect is temporary so it is necessary to keep doing them forever. If any other catastrophe occurs, making society unable to continue the geoengineering, catastrophic heating (much faster than today) would start within a few years.  Most of these geoengineering schemes fail to do anything to stop ocean acidification, so there would still be a catastrophe anyway.  13 July 2014 (US fossil fuel subsidies)  The US continues billions of dollars of subsidies to fossil fuels.  13 July 2014 (Organic fruit and vegetables)  A large meta-study found that organic fruit and vegetables tend to have more antioxidants and less pesticides and cadmium.  Metastudies are tricky, and if this tendency is real, it is not certain whether it translates into a health benefit. But it plausibly could.  13 July 2014 (Tax-dodging UK rock stars)  In the UK, tax dodging has been simplified so that even working class heroes that get famous can do it.  13 July 2014 (Obama regime's claims contradicted)  The Obama regime stated that it had not known that the UK was going to make The Guardian destroy the computer that a copy of the Snowden leaks, but in fact the highest US spymasters were informed.  12 July 2014 (Israeli hate for Arabs)  Uri Avnery: Israelis for the most part hate Arabs so much that they hardly feel any disgust towards the people among them who kidnaped and burned an Arab teenager.  I suspect that a secondary purpose of the bombing of Gaza is to distract attention from that crime with a bigger crime.  Here's a report from Gaza.  If Palestinians are situating military activities in homes with civilians, that is just as reprehensible as Israel's attacks on those homes. But they can't be launching missiles from homes, and Israel doesn't really need to attack anything except missile launchers.  Indeed, Israel hardly even needs to attack missile launchers. It could slap the missiles away, as it does, and not bother to retaliate, saying, "Are you tired of acting out? Done with your tantrum?" Israel's forbearance would make Hamas look like fools.  But that would not satisfy crowds that shout, "Death to Arabs." And it might create a situation where peace seems reasonable, which is the last thing Netanyahu wants.  12 July 2014 (Stripping names from data ineffective)  The idea of stripping people's names from their data from their histories and passing that around turns out not to work: it is too easy to figure out who they were.  All the more reason why digital systems must not collect people's histories.  12 July 2014 (Sex education)  A Republican candidate that advocates "abstinence only" as a substitute for sex education ended up with a pregnant teenage daughter.  What do you call people who teach their children "abstinence only"?Grandparents.  12 July 2014 (Deforestation and Ebola)  Deforestation by humans may be responsible for Ebola outbreaks in humans.  12 July 2014 (US media excuses Israeli violence)  US television showed a bombed-out Gaza family and said they were Israeli.  It is part of a standard pattern of greatly exaggerating Palestinian violence and excusing the much larger Israeli violence.  12 July 2014 (Detroit water shutoffs)  Citizens of Detroit blocked water shutoff trucks, and were injured by the thugs that arrested them.  I hope the next protest will involve thousands of Detroiters.  12 July 2014 (ACLU suing to put an end to investigating people for non-reasons)  The ACLU is suing to put an end to investigating people for non-reasons.  An FBI Counterterrorism Agent Tracked Me Down Because I Took a Picture of This.  12 July 2014 (Christie gave state subsidy for political agreement)  Chris Christie gave a state subsidy to a company run by a Democrat as part of an agreement not to oppose each other.  A proposed New Jersey law to ban political donations from companies that get state subsidies is just a part of what is needed to end political cronyism, a.k.a. plutocracy.  12 July 2014 (Clinton and Kerry want Snowden to submit to a trial)  Clinton and Kerry want Snowden to submit to a trial that imitates the mockery of justice in Alice in Wonderland.  12 July 2014 (Freedom of speech covers billionaires' money)  Senators that say freedom of speech covers billionaires' money also want to amend the Constitution to ban flag-burning.  12 July 2014 (Divesting from fossil fuel)  The World Council of Churches calls for divesting from fossil fuel.  12 July 2014 (Caliph of ISIS may have been radicalized in US prison)  The Caliph of ISIS may have been radicalized in a US prison in Iraq.  One can say this serves the US right, but Iraqis do not deserve the oppression of ISIS.  12 July 2014 (Parts of Miami Beach are regularly inundated)  Due to global heating, parts of Miami Beach are regularly inundated.  The Turkey Point nuclear plant will become an island, and will be vulnerable to a Fukushima-type disaster.  As the sea advances, millions of people will have to leave Florida, perhaps in a few decades. The Florida Keys may be submerged during this century.  I suspect that Florida land interests are behind Florida politicians' denial. Fools continue to buy buildings that are likely to be drowned, while somebody else extracts profits to move out of Florida before everyone else wakes up to it.  In 50 years, when the price collapses, will those fools' heirs sue Senator Rubio's heirs?  12 July 2014 (US gov't refuses to repudiate torture)  The US government refuses to repudiate torture, and continues to practice it, and US mass media treat it as admirable.  12 July 2014 (Nanomaterials)  Nanomaterials: a new range of substances that might be put in food, and some of them might have toxic effects.  A given chemical in the form of nanoparticles might have different effects from the same chemical in a different form. It could even depend on the size of the nanoparticles being used. I suppose most chemicals that are ordinarily nontoxic will not be toxic in nano form either, but there will be exceptions to stumble upon.  12 July 2014 (Climate saboteurs shifting from denial of global heating)  Climate saboteurs are shifting from denial of global heating to minimizing the expected consequences.  It's a delaying campaign to keep the money flowing unabated to fossil fuel companies as long as possible.  12 July 2014 (Gay-friendly materials likely to be censored)  Where censorship of sex is permitted, gay-friendly materials are likely to be censored &mdash; not just in Singapore, but in Canada too.  12 July 2014 (Greenpeace parody was taken down from YouTube)  A Greenpeace parody attacking the Shell/LEGO marketing partnership was taken down from YouTube by a vague copyright claim.  Using the DMCA for political censorship is not unusual. It could be considered common practice.  12 July 2014 (Kurds have dropped out of the Iraqi government)  The Kurds have dropped out of the Iraqi government.  This seems to be a push to make Maliki quit. However, since the Kurdish region aims for independence, perhaps Iraq could kick its representatives out of Parliament; then maybe it could form a government.  12 July 2014 (How UK is involved in US kidnapping for torture)  How the UK is involved in US kidnapping for torture, and how it blocks public inquiry into this complicity.  12 July 2014 (Urgent: Stop the ruining of antibiotics)  US citizens: call on the FDA to stop the ruining of antibiotics by feeding them to farm animals en masse.  12 July 2014 (New Pun)  New pun judge in space  12 July 2014 (Urgent: Fix the Hobby Lobby decision)  US citizens: Support the Senate bill to fix the Hobby Lobby decision.  12 July 2014 (Nando's Chicken tax-dodging)  The complicated tax-dodging scheme of Nando's Chicken.  12 July 2014 (US spending on F-35 fighter)  The US is spending a trillion dollars on the F-35 fighter whether it works or not.  12 July 2014 (Afghan presidential election)  Karzai approved a UN plan to check the ballots of the Afghan presidential election.  I hope that this makes it possible to find the real winner before the candidates start trying to defeat each other militarily.  12 July 2014 (Judge attacked for questioning taboo)  An Australian judge faces irrational attacks after saying that sex between siblings might not be inherently bad.  He seems to be talking about sex done willingly. Why should willing sibling sex be associated with "abuse"?  Alas, Judge Neilson is partly mistaken: some apparently still have a taboo about this, and they attack him for questioning the taboo. The attacks are blatant non sequiturs, claiming that sibling sex is bad because it's "disgusting" and because it's illegal.  12 July 2014 (Hoax on Australian bank)  Environmental defender Jonathan Moylan faces sentencing for posting a Yes Men-style hoax announcement that a bank had pulled out of a coal mine project.  If you are in Australia, you might want to move your money out of ANZ bank permanently as a protest against its destructive investments.  12 July 2014 (Sugar in "sports drinks")  "Sports drinks" have a considerable amount of sugar, and unless you're doing hard exercise for a long time, you're better off drinking water.  12 July 2014 (Pesticides and autism)  Some studies suggest certain farm pesticides increase the chance of autism; a pregnant woman who lives near a fields where they are used has a higher chance of an autistic child.  11 July 2014 (Terrible new cybersecurity bill)  Congress is about to vote on a terrible new cybersecurity bill which gives the NSA more spying authority.  Here's more detail.  11 July 2014 (Afghan civilian casualties)  Civilian casualties in Afghanistan are rising as the Taliban increasingly fight in towns.  Afghans don't get as angry when the Taliban kill civilians as they do when US soldiers or drones kill civilians.  11 July 2014 (Children facing deportation)  Children facing deportation need lawyers.  11 July 2014 (Fine for poisoning water supplies)  The fine for poisoning water supplies for 300,000 people: just 11,000 dollars.  11 July 2014 (Religious freedom in Guantanamo)  Obama's lawyers argue that prisoners in Guantanamo don't deserve the same religious freedom as a corporation.  11 July 2014 (UK public workers strike)  A one-day general strike of public workers shut down a lot of the UK, in response to a proposed law intended to make it hard for unions to strike.  Part of the motive for privatization of government services is to weaken unions, which helps drive workers' pay down and facilitates cheating them.  11 July 2014 (Teenager accused of "child pornography")  The Virginia thugs have given up on making child pornography of a teenager threatened with imprisonment for sending a picture of his penis to his lover.  The laws against "child pornography" are unjust, and this is one of many reasons.  11 July 2014 (The people killed by bombing Gaza)  Half the people killed by bombing Gaza are women and children. A good fraction of the men killed are probably noncombatants too.  The EU has deplored the bombing, while the US tries to shield Israel.  11 July 2014 (Encouragement for whistleblowers)  Big signs in Washington DC encourage whistleblowers to talk to exposefacts.org.  I asked an expert, who says that the site is good to use but reminds people to use https to communicate with it.  11 July 2014 (FBI treated Nelson Mandela as threat)  The FBI treated Nelson Mandela as some sort of Communist threat after he was released from prison.  11 July 2014 (Helsinki plans an integrated system of public transit)  Helsinki plans an integrated system of public transit that would make it obsolete to have a car.  This would be a tremendous advance, except that they plan to build in total surveillance as part of the fine print. Every portable phone is a tracking device, and if you have to pay through one, that means identifying yourself to the system. That would be a big step backwards for privacy.  If we don't want to live in a world of total surveillance, we must reject and oppose every new system that collects data about all users. We must insist on designing systems so that they do not track or identify people. Helsinki's transit system should provides ways to call for a ride by calling a number, and allow paying cash.  See http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html for more explanation, and practical recommendations.  11 July 2014 (FISA court is a rubber stamp for spying on people)  I did not sign a petition to make the FISA court stop profiling based on religion and a couple of other personal classifications because I think the real problem is that the FISA court is a rubber stamp for spying on people.  11 July 2014 (Thai editor jailed for a Facebook posting)  A Thai editor was jailed for a Facebook posting.  11 July 2014 (UK plants to rush new surveillance requirements)  The UK plans to rush new surveillance requirements into effect without debate.  11 July 2014 (New UK nuclear plant at the cost of a tremendous subsidy)  The UK plans to build a new nuclear plant at the cost of a tremendous subsidy, including buying the power for decades at an artificially high price.  I think the "compelling power" that won parties' support for this deal probably emanates from someone's money, but that gives me no clue about how.  11 July 2014 (Turkey ordered to pay compensation to two journalists)  The European Court of Human Rights ordered Turkey to pay compensation to two journalists that were imprisoned for a year with no grounds. However, they are on trial for publishing information about a supposed coup plot.  11 July 2014 (Don't be shocked that the US spied on American Muslims)  "Don't be shocked that the US spied on American Muslims. Get angry that it justifies spying on whomever it wants."  11 July 2014 (UK documents about its cooperation with CIA kidnapings)  UK documents about its cooperation with CIA kidnapings were destroyed by "water damage".  They could be telling the truth. Maybe they flushed these papers down the toilet &mdash; that would certainly lead to "water damage".  11 July 2014 (Urgent: Penalize US contractors with a history of cheating)  US citizens: Call on Congress to penalize US contractors with a history of cheating workers out of their pay.  Of course, there should not be so many contractors' employees &mdash; their numbers have been swollen due to privatization. Most of that privatization was perverse. We should reverse perverse privatization, moving the work back to civil service workers.  11 July 2014 (Jury put blame on thugs for shooting innocent woman)  A jury put blame on the thugs for shooting an innocent woman in London who then died of her injuries, 29 years ago.  The real question is, what will be done to keep the thugs accountable today so that they do not continue such practices?  11 July 2014 (Hong Kong's press freedom)  Hong Kong's press freedom has got worse over the past year.  10 July 2014 (Urgent: Boost Massachusetts minimum wage)  Citizens of Massachusetts: sign this petition to boost the Massachusetts minimum wage to $15.  10 July 2014 (Urgent: Oppose punishing Rev. Senyonjo)  Everyone: Call on Uganda not to punish Rev. Senyonjo for refusing to preach hatred of gays.  10 July 2014 (China tax exception for electric cars)  China has given a big tax exemption to electric, hybrid and fuel cell cars.  10 July 2014 (Israel's bombardment of Gaza)  Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed over 70 people. Targets included family homes (8 dead) and a cafe where people were watching soccer on TV (6 dead).  Israel has a recipe for killing Palestinian civilians with a built-in excuse: claiming it was aiming at military targets, and that it was "retaliating" for rockets.  The rockets, when aimed at civilian towns such as Sderot, are a war crime too, or more often an attempted war crime, since these rockets almost never hit anyone. But Israel intentionally started this battle, so it cannot plead "retaliation" now.  Hamas may have cynical motives for giving in to the provocation.  Natural gas under the sea is part of what the fight is about.  I don't think any amount of Israeli attack will make the people of Gaza reject Hamas. Its effect will be to make them cling to it more tightly.  10 July 2014 (Iraqi women organize secretly)  Iraqi women organize secretly to protect women from oppression from religious bullies, including ISIS.  10 July 2014 (US radio transmissions to Cuba)  The US stopped operating a plane that beamed radio transmissions to Cuba, which were nearly always jammed.  The programs contain a mixture of US government propaganda plus facts correcting Cuban government propaganda. That the Cuban government jams these transmissions indicates its own injustice.  10 July 2014 (Republican sabotage of gov't)  Arsonists Posing as Firemen: How GOP Sabotages Government for Fun and Profit. This article explains how Republicans' sabotage brought about several problems which they now attack Democrats for.  10 July 2014 (How oil companies handle opposition)  How oil companies try to steamroll local governments that oppose their projects.  10 July 2014 (Germany catches another spy)  Germany has caught another spy that first worked for the CIA, then tried to contact Russia.  10 July 2014 (Neonicotinoids and birds)  A study links neonicotinoids to falling populations of birds.  10 July 2014 (Surveillance of Muslim leaders)  Broad Coalition Urges 'Full Public Accounting' for Government Surveillance of U.S. Muslim Leaders.  10 July 2014 (US gov't subsidies for fossil fuels)  The US government and states gave fossil fuels 37 billion dollars of subsidy last year, and this has increased 45% since 2009.  Without this, renewable power would grow more.  10 July 2014 (Assault by LA thugs at protest)  I Filmed the LAPD Assaulting Me at Pro-Israel Demonstration.  10 July 2014 (Growing inequality)  The OECD predicts economic growth will almost cease by 2060, but inequality will keep increasing.  That's before counting the losses that global heating will cause; the report treats that as uncertain.  The report presumes that we will keep increasing productivity by automating more work. But I don't think this increased productivity is good at the cost of more unemployed poor people -- not if the benefits go to the rich. It would be better to limit the automation and keep more people employed.  We do not have to allow inequality to increase. The growing inequality is due to policies that can be changed.  10 July 2014 (Keeping global heating down)  The Earth Institute shows how we can still keep global heating down to a painful 2 degrees C, if we act firmly now.  The report offers specific targets and plans for the 15 most-emitting countries.  The report assumes substantial use of nuclear power, but I am sure the target can be met without that at the cost of some extra money.  10 July 2014 (Obama's secretive administration)  38 Journalism Groups Urge President to Stop Excessive Controls on Public Information.  Obama's administration seems to be the most secretive ever.  10 July 2014 (Targets of FBI and NSA spying)  Meet the Muslim-American Leaders the FBI and NSA Have Been Spying On.  The NSA does this without breaking the law, because the law is putty in its hands.  10 July 2014 ("Cybersecurity" bill)  Feinstein's senate committee adopted a "cybersecurity" bill that allows increased state surveillance.  10 July 2014 (Shortages in South Sudan)  The cease-fire in South Sudan is allowing the beginning of recovery but there is a shortage of food, medicine and doctors.  10 July 2014 (Israeli gov't censorship and lies)  The Israeli government had information showing that the three kidnaped teenagers were dead, but used censorship and lies to make the public believe they were being held as hostages by Hamas, and manipulate public feeling so as to attack Hamas.  10 July 2014 (Urgent: Oppose surveillance legislation)  Citizens of the UK: phone your MPs to oppose surveillance legislation being rushed through Parliament so fast there will be no time for it to be thought about.  https://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaigns/no-emergency-stop-the-data-retention-stitch-up  10 July 2014 (One of the Koch brothers was a Bircher)  One of the Koch brothers was a Bircher in the 60s and put money into fighting against civil rights.  10 July 2014 (Urgent: Stop supporting Monsanto)  US citizens: call on Hillary Clinton to stop supporting Monsanto.  10 July 2014 (Urgent: Suspend use of neonicotinoid pesticides)  US citizens: Tell the EPA to suspend use of neonicotinoid pesticides. There's plenty of evidence tying them to colony collapse of bees, and since they accumulate, it will take time for them to decrease in the environment.  10 July 2014 (Israeli troops confiscated computers)  Israeli troops confiscated the computers of Palestinian cultural magazines.  10 July 2014 (Social demand for collective mourning)  On the social demand for collective mourning for people one did not know.  I rejected the collective mourning for those who died in the September 2001 attacks; while Americans were supposed to feel angry and afraid, I focused instead on resisting the coming attack on our freedom.  10 July 2014 (Former speaker asks for nonviolent Palestinian movement)  The former speaker of the Israeli Parliament asks for a nonviolent Palestinian movement to pressure Israel into accepting peace.  10 July 2014 (Australia's Asylum Secrecy)  [Australia's] Asylum Secrecy on the High Seas Is Designed to Foil the Enemy Within &mdash; The Law.  A minister sees no sign of torture in Sri Lanka. In effect, he says he saw many Tamils who are not in prison or being tortured.  Some imprisoned asylum seekers have attempted suicide hoping to improve their children's chances of receiving asylum.  This suggests that those are economic migrants, aiming to get their children into Australia rather than fleeing persecution.  09 July 2014 (ALEC typo copied to new bill)  State legislators acting as tools for ALEC copied the error from ALEC's model bill.  The bill would be just as bad if they had been more careful, but this shows they are tools of ALEC, and not even very competent ones.  09 July 2014 (The Arab Peace Initiative)  The Arab Peace Initiative proposed a peace plan which still offers a direction for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  09 July 2014 (Palestinian nonviolent resistance)  Palestinians are still organizing nonviolent resistance, but they need the rest of the world to notice it.  09 July 2014 (Snowden detractors concede)  Those who refuse to recognize Snowden as a hero, and attack him for showing secrets to the press, are now compelled to admit that the NSA can't be trusted to keep its data about you and me private.  Of course, Snowden did not give this data to just any reporters. He chose reporters who would take care against harming the people mentioned in those data.  09 July 2014 (Depletion of Ogallala Aquifer)  The Ogallala Aquifer, which underlies parts of 8 US states, is being depleted rapidlyThe spreading drought (which will get worse due to global heating) is speeding this up.  09 July 2014 (Insider stock trading)  Congresscritters are resisting an investigation by the SEC of accusations of insider stock trading.  09 July 2014 (What TPP stands for)  Doctors: TPP Would Trample Access to Medicines.  TPP stands for Treaty for Plutocratic Power.  09 July 2014 (Israel's response to murdered civilians)  The extent of Israel's collective punishment response to three murdered civilians amounts to a far bigger wrong to Palestinian civilians.  09 July 2014 (Chinese writer asks thugs to arrest him)  Chinese writer Murong Xuecun asked the Chinese thugs to arrest him as they had arrested his friends.  09 July 2014 (Afghan presidential election)  The Afghan presidential election preliminary results declared Ashraf Ghani the winner, but Abdullah Abdullah accuses Ghani's campaign of ballot-stuffing and says he will set up a parallel cabinet.  I have no way to judge what the truth is, but running an election properly includes preventing opportunities for ballot stuffing.  09 July 2014 (Another excuse to invade Gaza)  Israel has created an opportunity to invade Gaza again. This gives it a chance to kill or wound hundreds of Palestinians, with an excuse to shield the killers from prosecution.  This is retaliation for rockets launched from Gaza, generally not by Hamas. These rockets are quite warlike but almost never hurt anyone. Effectively they are like a raised fist, which Israel generally responds to with attacks that kill plenty of civilians.  This cycle of violence started with the murder of three Israeli teenagers, to which Israel responded by arresting hundreds of Palestinians unrelated to the murder (generally without charges), and sending troops into Arab areas to harass large numbers of people. This predictably inspires young Palestinians to throw stones, which is an opportunity to shoot tear gas, which often injures people, and also an opportunity to shoot bystanders dead. It's even possible for a soldier to kill Palestinians with rubber-coated steel bullets or tear-gas canisters.  Israeli civilians living in colonies ("settlements") in Palestine are launching attacks against nearby Palestinian villages.  Here's Juan Cole's analysis.  09 July 2014 (Urgent: Network neutrality)  US citizens: Call on the FCC to choose complete network neutrality.  09 July 2014 (Urgent: Regulate recycling plants)  US citizens: call on the EPA to regulate pollution from recycling plants.  09 July 2014 (US agents seize son of Russian MP)  US agents seized Roman Seleznev, son of a Russian MP, in the Maldives.  Either the US agents kidnaped him without informing the government of the Maldives, or the government of the Maldives handed someone over to the US illegally without an extradition hearing.  Whether Seleznev is guilty of breaking computer security (please don't call it hacking!) is a different question. I know nothing about it; maybe he is, or maybe he isn't. But that seems like a secondary issue compared to the way he was grabbed.  09 July 2014 (Birds breeding earlier)  Arctic heating: a study of several bird species found they are breeding 4 to 7 days earlier than a decade ago.  09 July 2014 (TSA rule for powering up computers)  An ex-TSA agent ridicules the rule requiring powering up every computer. He says it is not likely to stop terrorists, but is sure to cause many people great upset. I suspect that one passenger a week will explode in violent rage at the confiscation of a computer that happened to be empty of power. The sadists will have a great excuse to imprison these people and really ruin their lives, and say they are doing it to protect us.  09 July 2014 (Clinton's Surveillance State baggage)  Hillary Clinton Flaunts Her Surveillance State Baggage.  09 July 2014 (UK cruelty to the weak)  The UK has secret quotas for kicking disabled people off benefits.  Cruelty to the weak is what it stands for.  09 July 2014 (Obama proposes Chalabi for Iraq)  It seems Obama is reaching for the bottom of the barrel to propose corrupt schnook Ahmad Chalabi to govern Iraq, or at least pretend to.  09 July 2014 (ISIS no excuse for mass surveillance)  A former chief British spy says that ISIS is not interested in attacking the West, and that publicly calling it a threat is self-defeating.  ISIS is a threat to human rights in the Middle East, and that makes it very bad. But we should not let governments make this an excuse for universal surveillance.  09 July 2014 (Urgent: Boycott Eden Foods)  Everyone: boycott Eden Foods for attacking access to birth control.  09 July 2014 (Millions of US veterans suffer from physical and psychological problems)  Millions of US veterans suffer from physical and psychological problems, and many commit suicide.  Being in a war that you can't justify to yourself requires a special sort of nihilism.  09 July 2014 (China cancelled American Tibetologist's visa)  China cancelled American Tibetologist Elliot Sperling's visa, apparently because he spoke up for the imprisoned Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti.  09 July 2014 (Mapping states from "tight" to "loose")  Mapping US states on a spectrum from "tight" (repressive) to "loose" (tolerant).  09 July 2014 (63 of the women kidnaped by Boko Haram escaped and walked to freedom)  63 of the women kidnaped by Boko Haram escaped and walked to freedom.  The article explains how politics has hampered the fight against Boko Haram.  09 July 2014 (Most aid agencies do little to help real refugees)  M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res reports that most humanitarian aid agencies have adopted bad priorities and do little to help real refugees.  09 July 2014 (Canada is holding negotiations about the TPP in a secret location)  Canada is holding negotiations about the TPP in a secret location. The government is evidently scared of the people's disapproval of its plan to betray democracy.  09 July 2014 (Legalizing marijuana has reduced violent crime in Colorado)  Legalizing marijuana has reduced violent crime in Colorado as well as creating jobs and increasing tax revenue.  Most importantly, it means an end to a system of prohibition that ruins many lives and spreads corruption.  Alas, we still have the "war" on other drugs. Some of those drugs are really addictive and/or harmful, but prohibition does even more harm.  09 July 2014 (CIA employee framed and then forced to resign)  CIA employee Jeffrey Scudder tried to go through channels to have old articles published &mdash; which was in fact his job. His reward was to be framed and then forced to resign.  Here's more information.  This is the route various authoritarian politicians (including Hillary Clinton) think Snowden should have taken.  09 July 2014 (President of Indonesia)  A former general associated with a massacre in East Timor, who has stated his opposition to democracy, may be elected president of Indonesia.  08 July 2014 (Greenhouse gas emissions and economy)  A study finds that the UK's policies intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have not decreased the total economy.  It could be that this is because the policies are not strong enough to avert disaster. However, disaster is not in any country's real economic interest.  08 July 2014 (Antibiotics)  Governments must act to assure development of new antibiotics.  Of course, they must also act to end the wasteful ruination of antibiotics once discovered, but they have not had the courage to tell meat producers to jump in the lake.  08 July 2014 (Urgent: Regulate pollution from refineries)  US citizens: call on the EPA to regulate pollution from refineries.  08 July 2014 (Global heating denial industry grasps at thin straws)  The global heating denial industry grasps at thin straws of sea ice to hide the overwhelming fact of heating.  08 July 2014 (Comparing ending of fossil fuel use with freeing slaves)  Comparing the ending of fossil fuel use with freeing the slaves in the US.  The similarity is not complete. Enslaving one person is an injustice, whereas burning one gallon of gasoline would hurt nobody if that were the only gallon burnt. But there are similarities.  08 July 2014 (States That Raised Their Minimum Wages)  US States That Raised Their Minimum Wages Are Experiencing Faster Job Growth.  08 July 2014 (The privatization of soldiers and intelligence agents)  The privatization of soldiers and intelligence agents creates armies of lobbies to increase the spending on them.  08 July 2014 (UK thugs attacked aged and/or disabled people)  Tony Nuttall describes how UK thugs violently attacked aged and/or disabled people who rode a train without paying to protest the plans to end the travel discount for old people and disabled people.  If the UK government were not so stingy with its support for old people and the disabled perhaps it would not be important to give them a discount on trains. Anyway, the conduct of the thugs is disgusting regardless of whether one agrees with the protesters.  08 July 2014 (Australia admitted handing over boat people from Sri Lanka )  Australia has admitted handing over boat people from Sri Lanka to the Sri Lankan navy.  Sri Lanka will hand them over to the thugs, and they may be prosecuted for departing Sri Lanka without permission.  Australia's high court ordered the state not to hand over another boatload.  08 July 2014 (World Bank considering relaxing standards for loans)  The World Bank is considering relaxing standards for loans to large projects that can involve fossil fuels or other dangers to the public.  08 July 2014 (Nader asks Americans to support two progressive candidates)  Ralph Nader asks Americans to support two progressive candidates for US Congress, one independent and one Green.  08 July 2014 (Capitalism is having a recovery for the rich)  Capitalism is having a recovery for the rich, but making this benefit the non-rich requires changing the system.  08 July 2014 (Hospitals buying personal data to warn people they might get sick)  Some US hospitals are buying personal data to warn people they might get sick.  I see no harm in this particular practice. If it seems creepy, that's because it is the consequence of something that really is creepy: the collection of all that data about people. That's what's really wrong.  I would not mind if my own computer kept a log of my purchases. I might find it useful to run a free program to look through them for things to warn me about. I don't want a data broker to have that data, which is why I always buy anonymously, paying cash.  07 July 2014 (TORorists)  Leaks show that NSA calls all Tor users "extremists" and makes them targets for spying.  Reading some Boing Boing articles is also enough to make a person a target.  I don't know whether reading THAT Boing Boing article would make you a target. Just to be careful, you should access it through Tor.  If it is true that a second NSA whistleblower has followed Snowden's path, I wonder if he was inspired by reading my emails. My emails say,  [[[ To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please consider &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]]] [[[ whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]]] [[[ foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example. ]]]   There is a t-shirt you can use to declare yourself a TORrorist.  If you have blocked nonfree JavaScript code, you will not be able to pay through Stripe. Please don't enable JavaScript; please pay with Bitcoin or some other method.  07 July 2014 (Facebook's conduct)  Nobody should have expected Facebook's conduct to be ethical.  07 July 2014 (US TV networks bullied by Exxon)  Exxon bullied the major US TV networks into refusing to present a paid political advertisement that criticizes Exxon.  All I can say is, Yexx!  If you want to watch the PSA, which is hosted on YouTube, please do not access the site directly! Use youtube-dl.  07 July 2014 (Hobby Lobby contraception coverage)  The owners of Hobby Lobby provided medical care including contraception coverage, voluntarily, until a group of right-wing Christians suggested this was a way to the secularity of the law.  Now Hobby Lobby demands to ban insurance from paying for doctor visits in which patients even discuss contraception. And the Supreme Court may have given it to them.  The battle over contraception is the central battle of the war for women's equality and emancipation.  07 July 2014 (HP CEO continues to cut jobs)  US TV lionizes the CEO of Hewlett Packard for continuing to cut jobs despite the "economic recovery" in the US (thus helping insure it's not a real recovery for the American people).  One incidental detail, irrelevant to the issue, is that this CEO is a woman. It's irrelevant to the issue because a male CEO could have done the same, and it would be equally wrong. The wrong here has nothing to do with her gender. It was right of FAIR not to mention that.  I mention it, though it is irrelevant to this issue, because there are feminists who campaign to have more female CEOs. I think they are being distracted by an irrelevancy.  With regard to CEOs, what matters most for working women isn't whether their chance of becoming one of those CEOs is one in a million or one in ten million. It is curbing the CEOs' power to harm them. Never mind how women CEOs get paid; focus on how women workers get paid.  07 July 2014 (New excuses for mass surveillance)  The UK government has come up with two new excuses to maintain surveillance of everyone.  What they amount to is, "If we can't watch everyone all the time, somewhat more crimes will happen." That's true. But if we allow the state to prevent crimes at any cost, it will oppress us. A state that the people do not control is a bigger danger than the crimes it fails to prevent.  The state itself commits frequent violence when it shows contempt for the people.  06 July 2014 (Sea-level rise hitting Virginia)  Sea-level rise is hitting Virginia so hard that even Republicans can't deny it.  It's not wholly due to global heating. The US east coast is slowly sinking, and this adds locally to the worldwide rise of the ocean caused by global heating.  06 July 2014 (Clinton praises Merkel)  Hillary Clinton praised Angela Merkel, Germany's right-wing leader who refused to relax the austerity that has crushed Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. This shows where Clinton's sympathies lie.  06 July 2014 (Electronic privacy proposal)  Massachusetts Legislature Advances Key Electronic Privacy Proposal.  06 July 2014 (Ethiopian land grab campaign)  An Ethiopian farmer says UK aid to Ethiopia funds the land grab campaign that chases thousands off their land and forces them into artificial villages where they can't get food.  This land grab is probably for the benefit of some global company.  06 July 2014 (Snowden gave journalists a sample of intercepts)  Snowden gave journalists a sample of intercepts. The Washington Post says that 1/9 of them were from real targets and 8/9 were from bystanders.  They show that the NSA lied again.  Here's the original story.  06 July 2014 (Suing the US for approving coal mines)  WildEarth Guardians are suing the US for approving coal mines without taking account of the pollution the mines and the coal will cause. The US government says the US can't afford to interfere with all that coal mining.  In the long term the US can't afford to let the mining continue, but the US government is more concerned with the short term interests of mining companies than the long term interests of the whole country.  06 July 2014 (Tariq Abu Khdeir says Israeli thugs attacked him out of the blue)  Tariq Abu Khdeir says that Israeli thugs attacked him out of the blue, and video shows them beating him while he was motionless.  Thugs around the world do this to the people they hate. In Israel, the thugs hate Arabs.  06 July 2014 (Freedom of religion is mostly obsolete)  Freedom of religion is mostly obsolete, because most of it is included in freedom of speech and thought.  I am not convinced it is 100% obsolete, because religion includes some practices of worship that people should also have the right to do, within reason (as long as they don't violate others' rights). For instance, the Religious Freedom Restauration Act was adopted so that people wouldn't get fired for their (lawful) religious practices. That's not included in freedom of speech and thought.  However, if the US banned firing people over things irrelevant to their jobs, this aspect of religious freedom would also be superseded.  06 July 2014 (Urgent: Join the People's Climate Mobilization)  Everyone: join the People's Climate Mobilization  06 July 2014 (Australians protested the dooH niboR budget)  Australians protested the dooH niboR budget proposed by the Australian Cruelty Party.  06 July 2014 (Mothers make their daughters prostitutes in Cambodia)  In Cambodia, patriarchy and poverty push mothers to make their daughters prostitutes.  The way income, when it arrives, melts away on various necessities of relatives (on whom one depends for aid in turn) is typical of life for poor people in the US, too. This makes getting out of poverty much harder that the non-poor suppose it is.  06 July 2014 (Israeli thugs arrested then beat up a Palestinian teenager)  Israeli thugs arrested then beat up a Palestinian teenager, who is a US citizen and a cousin of the teenager who was burnt to death.  The US government has criticized Israel for this.  Meanwhile, Israel has arrested suspects in the murder of his cousin.  It is unusual for Israeli civilians to kill a Palestinian, just as it is unusual for Palestinians to kill Israelis. In fact, lots of Palestinians are killed by Israelis, but usually the killers have impunity because they are soldiers or thugs.  06 July 2014 (Urgent: Override Hobby Lobby)  US citizens: call on Obama to make an executive order to override the effects of the Hobby Lobby decision.  06 July 2014 (California in extreme drought)  80% of California is now in "extreme" drought, but Californians should get used to this as global heating will lead to more and worse droughts.  06 July 2014 (Business whistleblowers)  The Supreme Court ruled in favor of protecting some businesses whistleblowers from retaliation, but not completely.  06 July 2014 (Spy arrested in Germany)  Germany has arrested someone who was spying for the US.  06 July 2014 (Ikea supported dictatorships)  Ikea supported dictatorships in the Soviet Empire in the 80s.  I think that this is comparable to buying cotton from Uzbekistan today.  06 July 2014 (Clinton evades issue re Snowden)  Clinton continues calling for Snowden to submit to a US trial while evading the issue that he won't be allowed to argue that his actions served his country.  05 July 2014 (Facebook's emotion experiment)  A new ethical issue about Facebook's experiment: Facebook gave researchers data about its useds without getting the useds' consent.  05 July 2014 (Reversing privatization)  The growing movement to reverse privatization of public services.  05 July 2014 (Public pressure against neonicotinoids)  Public pressure forced Syngenta to retract its request for "emergency" permission for massive use of neonicotinoids in the UK despite the EU's moratorium on their use.  05 July 2014 (Toxic herbicide for new GMOs)  If the EPA approves toxic 2,4-D as a herbicide for new GMOs, over 5000 schools in the US will be rather close to the spraying.  05 July 2014 (Conversation with Glenn Greenwald)  Orwell's Dystopian Future Is Almost Here: A Conversation With Glenn Greenwald.  05 July 2014 (Romanian massive surveillance)  Romania is rushing a massive surveillance law to require all communications to be registered.  05 July 2014 (Nuclear Nightmares)  Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late.  05 July 2014 (Kidnaped Arab teenager burnt alive)  The Arab teenager kidnaped in Jerusalem was apparently burnt alive.  Arabs on buses and streets are facing harassment that gets to the point of violence, though other Israelis sometimes try to protect them.  05 July 2014 (Dark dust melting ice)  Dark dust, from fires, deserts and machines, is melting ice around the world, even in the Himalayas.  05 July 2014 (The right to die)  Religious Activists Have Too Much Say Over Our Right to Die.  05 July 2014 (America's national parks changing)  America's national parks are already being changed by global heating.  In a century, they may still be parks (if there is still a state that can maintain them as parks), but aside from bare rock they will change beyond recognition.  05 July 2014 (New Jersey gun control bill vetoed)  Chris Christie vetoed a New Jersey bill to limit magazines to just 10 bullets.  05 July 2014 (Facebook dissident ideas study)  One of the researchers in the Facebook emotion experiment has been funded by the US government to study the spread of dissident ideas.  05 July 2014 (Denmark plans car tracking system)  Denmark plans to impose a nationwide system to track cars.  Such systems should only see cars that are being specifically sought, or are not properly licenses.  05 July 2014 (FDA proposes labels for added sugar)  The FDA has proposed to require food labels to state the amount of added sugar. The food companies are lobbying against.  05 July 2014 (Obama's head of the SEC)  Obama's head of the SEC has turned out rather susceptible to the wishes of the companies it is supposed to regulate.  05 July 2014 (Hong Kong arrests leaders of protest)  Hong Kong arrested the leaders of the large democracy protest.  05 July 2014 (UK ISP censorship)  A way to find out whether a web site is blocked by ISP censorship imposed by the UK government.  04 July 2014 (Chernobyl meltdowns)  Although some nuclear power advocates claim that the Chernobyl meltdowns did not directly hurt the public, some groups that were nearby show high levels of certain diseases.  04 July 2014 (Ethiopian "terrorist" faces execution)  An Ethiopian "terrorist" (i.e., opposition party leader) faces execution after being extradited by Yemen.  The UK does not want to protest about such threats to air travellers making connections because it intends to endanger them similarly on  similar excuses.  04 July 2014 (Urgent: Conflicts of interest)  Everyone: call on Temple University to tighten its standards for disclosure of researchers' conflicts of interest.  Two professors there did a study which purported to find that private prisons are great improvements in efficiency; it turns out they were funded by private prison companies, and the study is biased.  04 July 2014 (In India there are thousands of temple prostitutes)  In India today there are thousands of temple prostitutes, given to the temple as children by their families. For the most part, they are treated with the same contempt that other prostitutes receive. (I don't understand why many men feel that sort of contempt for prostitutes.)  04 July 2014 (Corporations using nondisclosure agreements to gag whistleblowers)  US corporations are using nondisclosure agreements to gag whistleblowers.  04 July 2014 (US Military Presence in Somalia)  US Confirms Years-Long "Secret" Military Presence in Somalia.  04 July 2014 (UK gov't curbing better heat insulation in homes)  The UK government's policies are curbing the installation of better heat insulation in homes.  This will help the government's patrons meet their targets for sales of fossil fuels.  04 July 2014 ("cloud"y thinking)  More evidence that you shouldn't rely on "cloud"y thinking about where to store or transmit data: SoundCloud says it will profile users, and has given the music factories direct censorship control.  Don't use big web sites to distribute files &mdash; to the public or to specific people.  04 July 2014 (Urgent: Regulate oil and gas drilling on US public land)  US citizens: tell the Fish and Wildlife Service to regulate oil and gas drilling on US public land.  04 July 2014 (Urgent: Call on CNBC to apologize)  Everyone: Call on CNBC to apologize for seeking to publish a denial of global heating.  04 July 2014 (Australia has stopped refugee boats from arriving)  The Heatless Party's government in Australia has stopped refugee boats from arriving, at the cost of contempt for refugees, the UN, the press, the Supreme Court, the Australian public and the truth.  04 July 2014 (Supreme Court Rules JCPenney Allowed to Sacrifice Employees )  Supreme Court Rules JCPenney Allowed to Sacrifice Employees to Appease Cthulhu. (I think this is a satire.)  04 July 2014 (French Puns)  New pun in french.  03 July 2014 (Urgent: People before business)  US citizens: call on Obama to drop the Trade in Services Agreement and other treaties that put businesses ahead of people.  03 July 2014 (More threats to Great Barrier Reef)  A crazy proposal to transfer massive quantities of coal from ship to ship in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef.  Pollution is certain to spread, but hey, if you're going to burn that coal the reef is doomed anyway.  03 July 2014 (Great Barrier Reef speed limits)  Calling for speed limits for ships near the Great Barrier Reef to protect whales from being killed by collisions.  03 July 2014 (Abbott on suggestions of violence)  In Australia, only right-wingers are allowed to suggest using physical violence on those they disagree with.  Abbott surely deserves to spend many years in prison for his treatment of Australian poor, foreign refugees, and all future life on Earth. But not death, because the death penalty is never justified.  03 July 2014 (UK thugs refuse to investigate thugs)  The UK thugs have refused to investigate how thugs cooperated with others (journalists, etc.) to spy illegally on individuals.  03 July 2014 (Private business and medicine)  An argument for eliminating private business from the development and manufacture of medicines.  I am not sure we need to go that far. I advocate eliminating private business from the testing and approval of medicines.  03 July 2014 (The Conservative Mind)  Freedom, Power, and the Conservative Mind.  03 July 2014 (Culture War against Children)  The One-Sided Culture War against Children. Whether US parents are too lax, or too controlling, the "solution" is always "impose standardized tests to fire teachers."  I find that US parents tend to be too lax on some issues (they can't say "Don't be used by Facebook!" or "Don't sign an EULA that says you are not allowed to give that to someone else!"), and twistedly strict on others (kids never get to be home alone; parents think that would kill them). But the "solution" of "impose standardized tests to fire teachers" is never going to help.  04 July 2014 (Peruvian interior minister accused of ordering killing)  One of the Peruvian soldiers convicted of killing journalist Hugo Bustios says that Peru's current interior minister Urresti ordered the killing.  04 July 2014 (Australia sends back asylum seekers)  Australia gives some asylum seekers a cursory screening and sends them back.  It does not matter a priori whether this is done on land or on a ship, but doing so on ship facilitates "accidental" errors which, at a systematic level, are not accidents.  While the government refuses to admit this, it effectively admits it by trying to pretend that Sri Lanka does not torture dissidents.  Australia's plans show that its goal is to keep refugees out no matter what the situation.  04 July 2014 (Health problems due to fracking)  Pennsylvania told state health officials not to return phone calls from people who had health problems due to fracking.  04 July 2014 (Pakistani Taliban and polio)  Attacking the Pakistani Taliban provides an opportunity to attack the disease they protect: polio.  04 July 2014 (Carbon offsets are fueling land grabs in Africa)  Carbon offsets are fueling land grabs in Africa.  04 July 2014 (Thugs in Kashmir given impunity)  Indian soldiers and thugs in Kashmir have been officially given impunity for torture, rape and murder. The mothers of the disappeared have organized in response.  04 July 2014 (Nigerian Atheist receives death threats)  Nigerian Atheist Bala has been released from the mental hospital thanks to a strike by doctors, but now receives death threats from fanatical Muslims.  Islamic law is incompatible with human rights. I've posted examples from Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, Saudi Arabiaand Sudan. I am sure there are more. Most "Muslim" countries forbid religious freedom to anyone who was once considered a Muslim.  Nigeria must insist that human rights apply to the whole of the country and that no local system is allowed to pre-empt them.  04 July 2014 (Improvised explosive devices)  Improvised explosive devices killed 53,000 people in 2011-2013, most of them civilians.  I don't see much hope of stopping this practice as long as the groups that set these bombs are tolerated by their communities.  03 July 2014 (Urgent: Boycott Hobby Lobby)  Everyone: pledge to boycott Hobby Lobby.  03 July 2014 (Urgent: Ban on drones in national parks)  US citizens: call for continuation of the "temporary" ban on drones in national parks.  03 July 2014 (Prosecution of Benghazi suspect)  Ahmed Abu Khatallah's lawyers say the US government has given them no information about the evidence against their client.  03 July 2014 (7 Palestinians killed by Israelis)  A little information about the 7 Palestinians killed recently by Israelis. 4 of them teenagers.  Killing people who are not hurting anyone is wrong no matter who they are. However, Western politicians seem to care only when Israelis are the victims.  03 July 2014 (Privacy and Civil Liberties Overboard)  The "Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board" turns out to be the Privacy and Civil Liberties Overboard.  03 July 2014 (Undercover UK thugs)  A court ruled that UK thugs must answer when women ask in court whether their lovers were undercover thugs.  03 July 2014 (Spain punishes striking workers)  Spain is punishing striking workers.  03 July 2014 (New FCC rule for TV political ads)  A new FCC rule will require US TV stations to show who pays for political advertisements.  It is a good rule, but we still need this default rule: Vote for whoever is criticized by the expensive attack ads! (Unless you have time for careful study of the accusations against ALL the candidates.)  03 July 2014 (Debate about Capitalism)  A debate about whether Capitalism inevitably produces great inequality or merely tends to do so.  I think that the great inequality is not inevitable, but avoiding it takes firmness that requires true democracy (government policies chosen by the people in general to keep the rich in check). Once the rich replace democracy with plutocracy, it is a sure thing that the policies necessary to prevent tremendous inequality won't be practiced.  03 July 2014 (Yasuni oil)  Ecuador drew up a plan in 2010 to build a power plant in Yasuni to support oil drilling there.  It is not certain that the plan to leave Yasuni oil untouched was dishonest. This could have been a contingency plan for what to do if the world failed (as indeed it did) to contribute the money Ecuador requested for leaving that oil untouched.  In any case, Correa deserves credit for trying something that no other world leader has even tried. If other countries had provided the reasonable sum he requested, he would surely have gone ahead with the deal.  03 July 2014 (Water supplies in Iraq and Syria)  Dwindling water supplies are crucial to the military outcome in Iraq and Syria. Control of a dam means use of the water in its lake, use of the electricity it generates, and the chance to use the water to drown people downstream.  A multi-year drought caused the protests against Assad.  Global heating will eventually make it impossible for the current population of Iraq to survive there.  Our actions that cause global heating are a wrong that we must stop. Iraq contributes to these actions by extracting oil for us to burn. Iraqis also contribute to the problem by having more children than the region can support. One way of reducing population growth is to give women more control over their reproduction. ISIS will clearly do the opposite of that, but so do the religious Shi'ite groups.  Perhaps the world will need to adopt the principle that climate refugees must get sterilized as a condition for asylum. Not as a punishment (they are not personally to blame), but as a sustainability measure.  03 July 2014 (ISPs from various countries have sued GCHQ)  ISPs from various countries have sued GCHQ for attacking their computers.  03 July 2014 (Diplomat accused of attempted rape)  Malaysia refuses to let a diplomat accused of attempted rape use diplomatic immunity as a shield.  03 July 2014 (Tony B'liar plans to help al-Sisi)  Tony B'liar plans to help al-Sisi gain more business opportunities for Egypt.  Since Egyptians won't be allowed to think about politics or freedom, or enjoy satire on TV, I guess business is all they will be left with.  03 July 2014 (Palestinian teenager kidnapped and killed)  A Palestinian teenager was, it appears, kidnapped and killed as an act of explicit revenge for the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers.  The killers of those three teenagers probably thought that was revenge, too. Israelis kill lots of Palestinians each year, including teenagers and protesters. They also torture Palestinian teenagers.  These killings are wrong on both sides, and I insist on condemning them the same.  03 July 2014 (The permanent stress caused by poverty)  The permanent stress caused by poverty causes children's brains to develop improperly. With almost 1/4 of US children living in poverty, this creates a permanent handicap for the US, as well as an irremediable injustice to those children.  03 July 2014 (Chomsky: America's Real Foreign Policy)  Chomsky: America's Real Foreign Policy: Global Corporatization by Force.  03 July 2014 (We are sucking the oceans dry of small fish)  We are sucking the oceans dry of small fish to feed fish farms, but farmed fish can grow on vegetable food too.  It will take laws to stop the overexploitation of the oceans. We will have to defeat the business forces that want to wipe them out. Perhaps we should ban the sale of farmed fish that are fed animal products.  03 July 2014 (Caribbean coral reefs will be lost within 20 years)  Caribbean coral reefs will be lost within 20 years. Pollution and overfishing will get them before the CO2 does it.  02 July 2014 (Chilean officials charged with murder)  Two Chilean officials have charged with murdering two Americans in Chile, with the help of the then head of the US military mission.  This was done shortly after the US-organized September 11 attacks.  02 July 2014 (Poor families in the UK in sheds)  Poor families in the UK can't afford to rent more than a shed to live in.  It could be worse: they could be homeless as in the US.  The UK has enough rooms of housing, but policies encourage the rich to use up a lot of space, pushing purchase and rental prices up and leaving the poor with too little.  02 July 2014 (Global heating helps locusts)  Global heating doesn't hurt everything. It helps locusts, for instance.  02 July 2014 (Detroit citizens' right to water)  Detroit Citizens Vow Direct Action to Protect Their Right to Water.  02 July 2014 (Effect of CO2 on damselfish)  Increasing CO2 levels make damselfish unable to recognize other fish that they know.  02 July 2014 (Iraq's parliament gives up)  Iraq's parliament has given up on forming a government, without even trying.  Partition of Iraq may be the way to avoid unending civil war. (I advocated this a decade ago.) However, avoiding unending war also requires that the Sunni regions be ruled by people that are not fanatics.  02 July 2014 (French ban on wearing masks)  The European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of the French law that bans wearing masks.  This law is typically thought of in connection with a tiny minority of Muslim women, but that is a side issue. Wearing a mask is the only way to protect yourself from being tracked by face recognition cameras. If such cameras are not banned, masks must be allowed as a defense.  02 July 2014 (March for democracy in Hong Kong)  Hundreds of thousands of citizens of Hong Kong marched for democracy despite rain and heat.  02 July 2014 (Accusations of sheltering Taliban)  Afghanistan has accused Pakistan for years of sheltering the Afghan Taliban. Now that Pakistan is attacking the Pakistani Taliban, it accuses Afghanistan of allowing them bases there.  02 July 2014 (Soldiers shooting children)  No US soldier starts out wanting to shoot children, not even once, but the dynamics of occupation lead to making that standard practice.  02 July 2014 (Foreign banks reporting US citizens' holdings)  The US is making foreign banks in many countries report US citizens' holdings.  02 July 2014 (World Cup Protests)   Protests stimulated by the World Cup show that Brazil's democracy is under long-term threat.  02 July 2014 (Urgent: Stop sale of unsustainable fish)  In the US: call on Kroger Supermarket to stop selling unsustainable fish.  02 July 2014 (Nanomaterials for animal growth)  The FDA is looking for nanomaterials to make animals grow faster.  In principle, this is a great idea. In practice, things may go wrong.  Animals will eat these materials in large quantities, then excrete them; what will happen then? Sewage treatment and water treatment plants were not designed with them in mind, so whether they get into our water will be a matter of luck. If they do, will they increase human obesity?  02 July 2014 (Egyptian satirist to terminate show)  Egypt's most popular satirist said he will terminate his TV show, implying that the regime will not allow him to continue it.  02 July 2014 (Denial of access to contraception)  The US Supreme Court found an excuse to deny some American women access to contraception.  This decision makes no sense in its own terms, because the whole point of a corporation is that it is a separate entity from its owners. They can have religious beliefs, but the corporation cannot. These particular owners, in aiming to impose their views over employees' rights, want to have it both ways. "When the corporation pays for medical coverage, it's really us. If the corporation loses money, it's not us."  This case is part of a general campaign to eliminate access to birth control on the part of Christian fanatics that resemble the Taliban in their misogyny and intolerance.  This question has a real effect because the most reliable forms of birth control involve a big expense once in a while. Getting insurance coverage for them makes a real difference for many US women, especially now that the same right-wingers have made more of them poor.  Congress could amend the Religious Freedom Restauration Act to fix this decision, but it would be better to amend the Constitution to state that human rights in general do not apply to corporations.  However, the clean solution to this problem (and many others) is to disconnect medical care totally from employment. Making employers pay for medical care for employees has the side effect of encouraging companies to eliminate full-time US jobs in favor of foreign operations, part-time subcontractors, or robots.  Instead we should make wealthy people and businesses pay for health care for everyone, employed or not, through a progressive income tax.  02 July 2014 (Bogus "science" in US schools)  Some US states are still trying to teach bogus "science" instead of evolution.  02 July 2014 (Sledgehammer to the Climate System)  Former NASA Chief Scientist: "We're Effectively Taking a Sledgehammer to the Climate System".  02 July 2014 (Effect of car exhaust on moths)  Car exhaust makes it hard for certain moths to find flowers.  02 July 2014 (Court blocks coal mine expansion)  [US] Court Blocks Coal Mine Expansion For Not Counting The Costs Of Carbon Pollution.  02 July 2014 (Jellyfish becoming more prevalent)  It's not clear why jellyfish are becoming more prevalent in the ocean, but they are. Sometimes catastrophically so.  I'm sure some aspect of human activities is responsible. We are changing ocean ecosystems in so many ways that it would be a bizarre coincidence if none of them contributed.  02 July 2014 (Investigator threatened by Blackwater)  Blackwater quashed a US investigation by threatening to kill the investigator.  The US created this situation by sending mercenaries to Iraq and failing to impose accountability on them. For instance, they got away with rape.  The US ought to extend to mercenaries the full spectrum of laws that apply to soldiers. Better yet, it should stop using mercenaries at all.  02 July 2014 (US CEO pay)  Mysteriously, US CEOs are paid much more than CEOs in other countries.  It would be interesting to find out what difference enables CEO pay to balloon more in the US than in Japan and Switzerland. I suppose that CEOs play one company off against another, but they would do that everywhere if they can. Why is it they can do so more in the US?  02 July 2014 (No Impunity for Abu Ghraib Torturers)  Federal Court: No Impunity for Abu Ghraib Torturers.  02 July 2014 (Pitchforks coming for plutocrats)  A plutocrat writes: The Pitchforks Are Coming&hellip; For Us Plutocrats.  Plutocracy kills poor people by the thousands, maybe even by the hundreds of thousands. Through global heating, that will become millions, then tens of millions. They are justified in fighting for their lives. The longer this battle is delayed, the more destructive it will be.  On the other hand, if we build up the anger and the movement fast enough, maybe we can restore democracy without violence, and end the killing.  02 July 2014 (Pakistan to fight Islamists)  Pakistan seems to be serious about fighting the Islamists of North Waziristan.  02 July 2014 (The Japanese constitution)  The US has pressured the Japanese government into "reinterpreting" its constitution to permit fighting war on behalf of allies.  02 July 2014 (Global heating, fires and heatwaves)  The Australian government rewrote advice about fires and heat waves to cover up their relationship to global heating.  02 July 2014 (Many Americans despise the poor)  Many Americans despise poor people, not realizing that they too are very likely to be poor some day.  Poor people don't deserve contempt for asking for help. We must give poor people what they need in order to have a decent life. All children deserve good food, a good education, and everything else children should have.  However, poor people have a responsibility, too, as well as rights: they must not act so as to increase their needs. Specifically, they should not have children. Reproduction is a desire, not a necessity. For most people, of all the things they do, reproduction is what puts the biggest ecological burden on the world.  02 July 2014 (36,000 Egyptians have been arrested for protests)  36,000 Egyptians have been arrested for protests since the coup against Morsi.  02 July 2014 (Deforestation in Indonesia is booming)  Deforestation in Indonesia is booming, even faster than in Brazil.  02 July 2014 ("Casino Saturation")  Atlantic City casinos are closing as the region hits "casino saturation".  Gambling does not increase wealth, it only redistributes wealth. Atlantic City casinos were touted as a way to redistribute wealth from other states to New Jersey. However, that's not the sort of redistribution than the US needs.  The US needs to redistribute wealth from the rich to the rest. Unfortunately, casinos redistribute wealth from the middle class and the not-totally-broke working class, and a substantial fraction goes to the casino owners. It's a false solution, offered to reduce demand for a real solution.  02 July 2014 (Tax exemptions for environmental protection organizations)  Australia's government wants to eliminate tax exemptions for environmental protection organizations and forbid them to carry out boycotts.  It is understandable that the Australian government is concerned about donations to charities that help the poor and the sick, since it proposes a budget that would make poor and sick Australians dependent on those charities.  However, in the long term, protecting the environment is crucial for everyone's well-being.  02 July 2014 (US and European forests)  Global heating is going to cause a revolution in US and European forests.  02 July 2014 (Urgent: Help tackle the ebola virus outbreak)  US citizens: call on the WHO to help tackle the ebola virus outbreak without delay.  02 July 2014 (Israeli teenagers killed and buried)  The three missing Israeli teenagers were killed and buried.  There is no indication of who killed them, but Netanyahu is using their deaths as an excuse to attack people all over the West Bank and Gaza.  Israel's reprisals have killed 6 Palestinians so far, and imprisoned 400 people. Israel has not bothered to charge them with any crime, and clearly has no evidence to relate them to the three murders. Clearly most of them were not involved.  Is Israel no better than Egypt? Al-Sisi at least has courts "convict" those he wishes to kill or imprison. The "trials" are not serious, but that provides an opportunity to pressure Egypt to do better. Israel does not even bother with trials.  02 July 2014 (ISIS has proclaimed a caliphate)  ISIS has proclaimed a caliphate.  While directly this means nothing, it may convince lots of young foolish Muslims to support ISIS.  The biggest advantage of ISIS thus far seems to be that it is more cruel, bloody and unscrupulous than its rivals. I fear that this monstrous ideology will kill millions before it is stamped out. If you are a Muslim and you don't want your community destroyed by violent fanatics, you had better organize now to keep them out.  02 July 2014 (Industry without pollution control)  The Chinese government has been compelled by events to recognize that industry without pollution control has poisoned lakes and soils with heavy metals that cause cancer.  Nonetheless, people who campaigned to stop this are still treated as enemies of the state.  02 July 2014 (Facebook experiment)  Facebook experimented with putting happier or sadder material into its useds' feeds, and found that had a tiny but measurable effect on their emotions.  I don't see an ethical problem in the experiment as such. It seems to me little different from trying different text on your web site's front page, except that they wrote a scientific paper about it.  However, Facebook's power to influence people does seem dangerous.  Here are many reasons not to be a used of Facebook.  02 July 2014 (Emperor penguins threatened with extinction)  Emperor penguins are threatened with eventual extinction due to global heating.  01 July 2014 (Urgent: Effects of sugar consumption)  US citizens: call on the Surgeon General to report on the health effects of sugar consumption.  01 July 2014 (How US senators and reps voted)  Americans: see how your senators and representatives voted on holding corporations responsible for their actions.  01 July 2014 (Teacher pension cuts)  California's teachers' unions are failing to fight back against pension cuts imposed by Democrats, but Chicago's teachers organized public support, struck, and won.  01 July 2014 (FISA court extremely permissive)  The FISA court's standards for NSA surveillance are extremely permissive.  We also know that the NSA has deceived the FISA court.  01 July 2014 (Threat to the Great Barrier Reef)  Dredging a coal port near the Great Barrier Reef could cause even more damage than previously thought, because currents can cause the millions of tons of debris to spread.  01 July 2014 (Secret handover of Tamil refugees)  Australia has secretly handed over a boat full of Tamil refugees to Sri Lanka's navy, which is sure to torture them.  The Australian government cannot shield itself from condemnation by refusing to admit its actions. That can prevent us from getting proof, but we don't need that standard of proof to condemn a state for evildoing. The state's refusal to say what happened is enough basis to declare it guilty.  It is different when a human being is prosecuted. For instance, when the minister is put on trial for his role in this, he will be entitled to be considered innocent unless proved guilty. However, at that time it will also be possible to subpoena the evidence to see if it proves his guilt.  None of that applies now, because a state is not entitled to human rights.  01 July 2014 (Russia prohibits dirty words)  Russia has found an excuse to ban most foreign and non-conservative literature: a prohibition on certain dirty words.  01 July 2014 (Guantanamo kangaroo courts stuck)  Obama's military kangaroo courts for Guantanamo prisoners are getting stuck on the issue of how the CIA tortured the defendants.  Some of those people may be guilty of real crimes, but if the US can't give them a fair trial because the US tortured them, it has to let them go. Let that be a lesson to us: no torture!  Some fraction of those released may fight the US, but we should not overestimate the importance of that. Violent Islamist groups have thousands of members; a few more won't make much difference. What mainly affects their strength is their ability to recruit.  Guantanamo serves them very well as a recruiting tool, and so does the US refusal to face justice for its torture. Try as they might, a few ex-prisoners won't be able to do the US the sort of harm that the US does to itself.  The US must stop betraying what it stands for, so that it can inspire honest friendship and support around the world, instead of inspiring people to join Islamist fanatic groups.  01 July 2014 (Kiribati prepares for sea rise)  Kiribati has purchased high ground in Fiji as a place to move once the islands of Kiribati are swamped by rising seas.  Does the US government have plans to move the graves of the US Marine cemeteries on Tarawa Atoll?  I don't think there is any intrinsic importance in how corpses are treated (including my own, after my death), but soldiers tend to consider this very important. Many US veterans are right-wing and some are global-heating denialists. This question might offer a way to make them face the facts.  01 July 2014 (Lego-Shell marketing arrangement)  Greenpeace urges Lego to drop a marketing arrangement with Shell.  01 July 2014 (Protester adds labels to dresses)  A clever unknown protester added labels to dresses in a store, saying "'Degrading' sweatshop conditions" and "Forced to work exhausting hours".  The law proposed in this article would be a good step forward, but really we should make the marketing companies that subcontract manufacturing responsible for the working conditions of their whole supply chain.  They should also have to register their subcontractors to all levels, which will have the salutary effect of impeding them from changing their supply chains so often.  01 July 2014 (Thugs licensed to kill protesters)  Peru has given thugs a license to kill protesters.  01 July 2014 (Starbucks "scholarship" program)  Starbucks announced a "scholarship program" for its employees, but it turns out that Starbucks is contributing no money to this, just extracting publicity from it.  01 July 2014 (Reparations owed to US blacks)  The case for paying reparations to US blacks for slavery and oppressive racist laws.  The book Inequality by Design, by Claude Fischer, explains how forcing a group into second-class citizenship affects their descendants too. Thus, I believe the US owes reparations to the descendants of people who suffered a racist denial of equal rights. My ancestors did not participate in doing this, but the reparations must be paid by Americans of today. That includes me.  Of course, the reparations should come mostly from the rich.  01 July 2014 (Drone assassination memo)  The drone assassination memo that the Obama regime released, redacted and incomplete, depends on a body of secret law.  01 July 2014 (Overprotection of children)  Insane overprotection of children in the US has gone beyond social pressure and reached the point of physical threats. A father was arrested in Ohio for not stopping his son from walking to a store.  The store was half a mile away from his home. When I was 8 I walked around that far to school and back every day, in Manhattan.  01 July 2014 (Texas abortion black market)  Texas women must now get their abortion medicine on the black market.  01 July 2014 (Returns on stocks)  Rich people in the US get a far greater return on their stocks than middle-class people.  01 July 2014 (Guantanamo propaganda)  Guantanamo propaganda teams describe hunger strikes as a tactic to discredit the prison authorities and the US government.  This is the twisted logic of someone who adopts the moral premise that "No matter what we have done, it can't ever be wrong."  The prison propagandists also habitually accuse the prisoners of being terrorists, even though none has been convicted of this, and the government says half of them should be released.  01 July 2014 (Congress's ability to study issues)  Republicans in Congress have spent 20 years sabotaging Congress's ability to study issues.  It makes sense. Right-wingers don't want careful study of their proposals; such study might find flaws in them before they are adopted.  01 July 2014 (Foreign workers in Qatar riot)  Foreign construction workers in Qatar, who have to work 14 hours a day, rioted when security guards attacked them for trying to go to the toilet and get water.  01 July 2014 (UK definition of "domestic extremism")  The UK has come up with a definition of "domestic extremist", which when combined with the misleading definition of "serious criminality" allows them to label anyone who might plan a large sit-in as a "domestic extremist".    2014 July - October | Previous (2014 March - June) >>  Each note starts with a date and a brief topic in parentheses.

Link Policy       28 February 2014 (Hong Kong press freedom threatened by business ties)  Hong Kong's press freedom is threatened by the business ties of its mainstream media, much as occurs in the US, but Hong Kong journalists are often physically attacked too.  28 February 2014 (Unidentified soldiers seize regional parliament of Crimea)  Unidentified professional soldiers have seized the regional parliament of the Crimea on behalf of Russia.  I suppose this was arranged by Russia.  28 February 2014 (Egyptian workers start wave of strikes)  Egyptian workers have concluded that the new government will do nothing for them, and have started a wave of strikes.  28 February 2014 (Navy knew Fukushima dangerously contaminated USS Reagan)  Documents Say Navy Knew Fukushima Dangerously Contaminated the USS Reagan.  28 February 2014 (DOJ ducking scrutiny after misleading Supreme Court)  DOJ Still Ducking Scrutiny After Misleading Supreme Court on Surveillance.  28 February 2014 (UK conservatives reject plans to reduce child poverty)  The UK Conservatives reject plans to reduce child poverty. I guess they conflict with the Conservatives' plans to increase poverty.  27 February 2014 (Credit Suisse helped 22000 Americans evade US taxes)  The US Senate is pursuing Credit Suisse for helping 22000 Americans evade US taxes.  27 February 2014 (GCHQ collected Yahoo webcam images of almost 2 million people)  GCHQ collected Yahoo webcam images of almost 2 million people, some of them nude.  It's irrelevant for investigation but handy for blackmail.  27 February 2014 (Author Stieg Larsson made progress in investigating the murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme)  Author Stieg Larsson made progress in investigating the murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme.  27 February 2014 (The Reality of Cartel And Monopoly)  The Prevailing Myth of Consumer Clout Distracts Us From the Reality of Cartel And Monopoly.  27 February 2014 (Proposed geoengineering methods have inherent limits)  Proposed geoengineering methods have inherent limits and can't counteract global heating.  27 February 2014 (Global heating has not ceased since 2000)  The US NAS and the Royal Society go on record affirming that global heating has not ceased since 2000.  27 February 2014 (Missionary confessed he was setting up a spy ring)  A South Korean missionary arrested months ago in North Korea has confessed he was setting up a spy ring. Under the circumstances, I am skeptical of this confession. Truth is of little importance to the North Korean state.  Bullying people to make false confessions is, alas, not limited to North Korea.  27 February 2014 (Working hard to market unhealthful foods to children)  Fast food companies are working hard to market unhealthful foods to children.  27 February 2014 (Indentured servitude called Kafala)  Foreign workers in Qatar and some other Gulf states are forced into a sort of indentured servitude called Kafala.  27 February 2014 (The cost of caring for disabled middle-class old people)  The cost of caring for disabled middle-class old people in the US regularly bankrupts them.  27 February 2014 (Amnesty International has accused Israeli soldiers of killing and wounding many Palestinian civilians)  Amnesty International has accused Israeli soldiers of killing and wounding many Palestinian civilians for no reason.  These soldiers enjoy almost total impunity.  27 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose two anti-environment bills)  US citizens: call on your congresscritter to oppose two anti-environment bills.  27 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose purchase of palm oil made via deforestation)  Everyone: call on Proctor and Gamble to commit to stop buying palm oil made via deforestation.  27 February 2014 (Australian gov't hides from need to curb frequency of droughts)  The Australian government offers aid to farmers hit by drought now, but hides from the need to stop making drought more frequent.  27 February 2014 (30% insufficiency in fresh water predicted for 2030)  A 30% insufficiency in fresh water is predicted for 2030.  I think the fresh water scarcity demonstrates that humanity needs a new ethic of reproduction and resource use.  27 February 2014 (Fracking likely to delay adoption of renewable energy)  A UN warning: the effect of fracking is to delay the adoption of renewable energy.  27 February 2014 (Companies trying to make plastic by taking CO2 out of the air)  Companies are trying to make plastic by taking CO2 out of the air.  Plastics made in this way should not have to compete on an equal basis with plastics made from petroleum. Rather, they should be subsidized through a greenhouse gas emissions tax, which in their case would be negative (a subsidy).  27 February 2014 (Palestinian teenager transferred to political prison after two hunger strikes)  15-year-old Palestinian prisoner Ubaida Asaid, who is imprisoned without charges, needed two hunger strikes to get transferred to a political prison rather than being locked up with criminals.  27 February 2014 (Convicted anti-fracking protester calls for increased activism)  Convicted anti-fracking protester Natalie Hynde calls for more to resist fracking.  27 February 2014 (US still claims it works to "promote democracy")  The US continues to claim that it works to "promote democracy", although its actions often hardly fit that description.  27 February 2014 (Tiny GPS trackers on birds)  Tiny GPS trackers on birds are providing a wealth of surprising information about their migration practices.  I'm entirely in favor of this, but the threat of using such trackers on people should be obvious.  27 February 2014 (Political power of the military-industrial complex)  Right-wing criticism of needed cuts in the US Army illustrate the political power of the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned about.  27 February 2014 (The Manifold Lies of Chris Christie)  The Manifold Lies of Chris Christie.  27 February 2014 (US to make school meals less fattening)  The US will take steps to make school meals less fattening.  This seems like a positive step, but the fact that it needs the support of beverage companies illustrates the lack of democracy in the US. In a democracy, the people would be strong enough to adopt policies that some businesses don't like.  Please don't buy any Coca Cola Company products; please support the world-wide boycott of Coca Cola Company, launched because of the murder of union organizers in Colombia.  27 February 2014 (Credit cards to be connected with cell-phone location tracking)  Credit cards will be connected with cell-phone location tracking.  Schemes like this, that pressure people to let themselves be tracked, worry me greatly for the future. However, this one will only pressure those that are already surrendering to pressure, by paying with credit cards. Don't be tracked &mdash; pay cash!  27 February 2014 (Israeli soldiers fire tear gas at fleeing children)  A few Palestinian children threw stones at some Israeli occupation soldiers, so the soldiers fired tear gas at a crowd of fleeing children.  27 February 2014 (Israel arrests Palestinian journalist for "incitement")  Israel arrested a Palestinian journalist for calling an Israeli official "the mayor of occupied Jerusalem".  Does that look like a crime to you? I don't know whether I agree with the statement or not, simply because I don't know the pertinent facts about that man's office; but even if the statement is a stretch, it must not be a crime.  27 February 2014 (Bringing a Palestinian child back to Gaza after surgery)  For a Palestinian, getting a permit to bring a 7-year-old child to Gaza after surgery is not easy.  27 February 2014 (Cutting back on nurses increases death rate after surgery)  Cutting back on nurses in European hospitals increases the death rate after surgery.  US hospitals cut back on nurses 20 years ago. A friend who was a nurse quit the profession rather than take legal responsibility for supervising lots of untrained personnel, more than she could effectively supervise, and be at risk of a lawsuit if any of them screwed up.  27 February 2014 ("Social smokers" underestimate danger to their health)  People who smoke a few cigarettes a day underestimate the danger to their health.  27 February 2014 (Journalist detained and tortured by Somali security agents)  [Somali] Security Agents Still Hound Journalist After Detaining, Torturing Him.  27 February 2014 (Pakistani thugs torture man for protesting US drone attacks)  Kareem Khan was grabbed by Pakistani thugs and tortured for campaigning against US drone attacks.  27 February 2014 (Turkish PM accused of corruption)  Turkish PM Erdogan is accused of corruption with phone call recordings he claims are falsified.  I don't know what the truth is about these recordings, but it is clear that he is the enemy of freedom in Turkey.  27 February 2014 (Iranian journalist attacked and arrested while protesting)  Iranian journalist and dissident Mohammad Nurizad was attacked and arrested by thugs as he protested in front of the "intelligence ministry".  27 February 2014 (Agitation in the Crimea for secession from Ukraine)  In the Crimea, with a Russian-descent majority, there is agitation for secession from Ukraine.  It seems to me that if the inhabitants of the Crimea want to become part of Russia, they should be allowed to do so; therefore, I suggest committing to hold a plebiscite in two years time to decide this.  That will give the Crimeans a chance to see whether the government of Ukraine is democratic and to think about whether they really prefer to be ruled by Putin.  27 February 2014 (North Korean escaper sends leaflets to North Korea)  North Korean escaper Park Sang Hak sends balloons with leaflets over the sky of North Korea.  27 February 2014 (US Army's infiltration of antiwar protesters)  The US Army infiltrated antiwar protesters in Washington State.  More information.  27 February 2014 (Chinese man sues local gov't over cost incurred due to pollution)  Chinese Man Demands Local Government Repay Cost Of His Treadmill In Landmark Anti-Pollution Lawsuit.  27 February 2014 (Over 60 potential sources of pollution along Elk River)  Over 60 West Virginia Facilities Could Contaminate The Elk River's Water Supply, Report Finds.  26 February 2014 (9 of the 10 most unhappy US states are run by Republicans)  9 of the 10 most unhappy US states are run by Republicans.  26 February 2014 (Possible execution for calling for independence for the Uighurs)  A Uighur Chinese faces possible execution for calling for independence for the Uighurs.   I have no opinion on the question of independence for the Uighurs, but criminalizing his point of view is clearly wrong.  26 February 2014 (Pilots exposed to Agent Orange)  Pilots that flew US planes that had previously been used to drop Agent Orange on Vietnam were exposed to the toxin, perhaps to high levels of it.  Keep this in mind with regard to the corn that is designed to be resistant to Agent Orange.  26 February 2014 (Don't shrink the US post office &mdash; what the US needs is jobs)  Don't shrink the US post office &mdash; what the US needs is jobs.  26 February 2014 (A complete US withdrawal from Afghanistan is a good idea)  A complete US withdrawal from Afghanistan is a good idea.  26 February 2014 (Assumptions about values)  Which expenses the media blame for tight budgets reflects assumptions about values.  When we're talking about proprietary software such as Mr Bill profits from, don't get distracted by the price paid for it; that's a secondary problem: proprietary software is an injustice even if it costs nothing.  26 February 2014 (The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is leaking)  The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, which was supposed to hold nuclear waste and never ever leak, is leaking.  I'm not sure that this leak is dangerous, but until people understand how it happened, there is no way of guessing how much more may leak.  26 February 2014 (Ireland faces a lot of embarrassment)  Ireland faces a lot of embarrassment for imprisoning anti-military protester Margaretta D'Arcy.  26 February 2014 (Right-wing extremists arrested for plotting an attack on the US gov't)  Right-wing extremists have been arrested for plotting an attack on the US government.  I have no more sympathy for these right-wing militants than for Islamists, but in both cases we must beware of letting the state manufacture plots to prosecute people who would otherwise never have done any harm.  26 February 2014 (Foreign domestic workers in Qatar are subject to slave-like conditions)  Foreign domestic workers in Qatar are subject to slave-like conditions.  This happens in the UK too, and it's unacceptable in either place.  26 February 2014 (Personalized "news" feeds)  Personalized "news" feeds are atomizing society and facilitating well-funded pseudoscience such as global heating denialism.  26 February 2014 (Thug visits a person according to algorithm)  In Chicago,   For a thug to visit a person with a sign is not violence and doesn't deny that person's human rights. Thugs often bully and threaten people, but if all the thug does is show up at someone's door with a sign, that is not bullying.  Thus far, I don't see any reason why this needs to be restricted or why it matters what the algorithm is that selects people for visits.  The real question here is, does that visit tend to make a person less likely to commit crimes? And if so, what other effects does it tend to have?  If the visits &mdash; or other consequences of selection &mdash; tend to have harmful effects on the person selected, that would be a real problem, and whether race indirectly causes people to be selected would become a real issue.  Here's where this might lead.  26 February 2014 (The Patent System)  The patent system is, at best, not work keeping.  26 February 2014 (A $10.10 minimum wage)  A $10.10 Minimum Wage Would Make A DVD At Walmart Cost One Cent More.  26 February 2014 (US Lags Behind World in Temp Worker Protections)  U.S. Lags Behind World in Temp Worker Protections.  26 February 2014 (Obama fighting cuts to the military)  President Obama Is Fighting Cuts to the Military, Not Demanding Them.  26 February 2014 (The US Should Respect Venezuela's Democracy)  The US Should Respect Venezuela's Democracy.  26 February 2014 (Growth and retreat of Qori Kalis glacier in Peru)  The growth and retreat of the giant Qori Kalis glacier in Peru has been linked to world temperature.  26 February 2014 (Public Knowledge condemns bill to legalize unlocking of mobile phones)  Public Knowledge has condemned a bill to legalize unlocking of portable phones because it has been modified so as to endorse in principle the idea that copyright should control this activity.  I agree. The DMCA provisions that ban breaking DRM must be repealed entirely and replaced with a ban on DRM (digital restrictions management).  DefectiveByDesign.org  26 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose fracking)  Everyone: tell the CEO of ExxonMobil that he's not the only one whose backyard shouldn't be fracked in.  Don't let the oil companies drive us to frack and fruin.  26 February 2014 (Denial of global heating)  Denial of global heating is a form of pseudoscience.  26 February 2014 (LinkedIn setting up censored Chinese subsidiary)  LinkedIn is setting up a censored Chinese subsidiary.  26 February 2014 (Man in Japan tries and fails to kill without a gun)  A man in Japan tried to kill strangers, but since he couldn't find a gun, he had to use a car, and didn't succeed in killing anyone.  26 February 2014 (NYC postpones plan to wake up homeless people sleeping on train)  New York City postponed a plan to wake up all the homeless people sleeping on the E train line.  25 February 2014 (Edward Snowden's moral courage)  Edward Snowden's moral courage, and why massive surveillance made it necessary.  I know something about moral courage. Thousands of programmers could, in 1983, have decided to reject the enticing profits of proprietary software and develop a free operating system, but I'm the only one who did it.  I had the determination to swim against the current, and keep doing so despite ridicule, insults, and attempts to convince me to ruin everything by compromising too far. But I didn't have to face a threat to put me in prison.  Snowden's act demanded far more moral courage than mine, and I honor him for that.  25 February 2014 (Children murdered by Boko Haram)  Boko Haram murdered school children sleeping in their dormitory.  25 February 2014 (Advertising designed to look like news articles)  Prestigious journalistic outlets now publish advertising designed to look just like news articles.  25 February 2014 (Perpetrators of mass murder in Indonesia in power and honored)  The perpetrators of mass murder in Indonesia in 1965/6 remain in power and honored. A documentary that offered them a chance to re-enact the crimes they are proud of has started a debate about the crime.  25 February 2014 (China's air pollution interferes with agriculture)  China's air pollution is so bad that it interferes with agriculture.  25 February 2014 (If Hillary Is the Only Candidate, Where Does She Stand on Keystone XL)  If Hillary Is the Only Candidate, Where Does She Stand on Keystone XL?  I won't vote for a right-winger like Hillary Clinton. I did not vote for her husband in 1996 after I had seen what a right-winger he was, and I did not vote for Obama for the same reason. It was clear even in 2008 that he was talking about "Change" to avoid taking a stand for any important change.  I think it will be an advance if a woman can get elected president, just as it was an advance that a black man can get elected president, but I won't support a candidate because of that person's sex or race. Nor will I support the Democrats merely because Republicans might be worse. Voting for the "lesser of two evils" is a road to ever worse. If Ms Clinton is the Democratic candidate, I will vote Green (again).  I hope to have the chance to vote for Elizabeth Warren.  25 February 2014 (Reparations for the slave trade)  Former plantation colonies of the UK want reparations for the slave trade.  The descendants of slaves in the US deserve reparations because the effects continue. Whether this applies to most of the countries in the Caribbean, I don't know, but Haiti certainly deserves reparations from France.  25 February 2014 (Deal with EU would have limited benefits for Ukrainians)  The people of Ukraine should think carefully before making a deal with the EU.  25 February 2014 (World-wide fishing police force)  Proposing a world-wide fishing police force.  25 February 2014 (Yanukovych's millions hidden offshore)  Yanukovych's hidden millions spotlight how easy it is to hide the fruit of corruption offshore.  25 February 2014 (Temporary cooling due to volcanic eruptions)  Volcanic eruptions since 2000 have caused a temporary cooling that cancels out part of the heating effect of greenhouse gases.  To cancel it out entirely would require a higher level of vulcanism. However, that would work only for a time. As we pump more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, cancelling them out would require a steadily increasing level of vulcanism.  Setting aside the harm those eruptions would do if they occurred, there is no reason to expect them to happen.  Moreover, eruptions can also emit greenhouse gases, so over the long term they can make things worse.  25 February 2014 (Dirty tricks used by GCHQ to ruin people's reputations)  GCHQ uses dirty tricks to ruin people's reputations. It uses this tactic against dissidents who are in no sense terrorists.  25 February 2014 (Active whistleblower inside the NSA)  There may be an active whistleblower inside the NSA now.  25 February 2014 (Digital delivery of bills)  Is digital delivery of bills and such more sustainable than mailing paper? It's not clear.  What is clear to me is that I'd rather not have the information going through the internet. I don't do banking over the internet, and I get my statements in paper.  25 February 2014 (Anatomy of the Deep State)  Anatomy of the Deep State: Beneath Veneer of Democracy, The Permanent Ruling Class.  25 February 2014 (Hypocrisies of the Super-Rich)  Hypocrisies of the Super-Rich.  25 February 2014 (Australians rally against gov't secrecy about treatment of refugees)  Australians rallied against the government's secrecy about how it is treating refugees.  25 February 2014 (Attack on Sea Shepherd vessel)  Sea Shepherd says Japanese whaling ships attacked one of its vessels in an attempt to damage it.  Australia's right-wing government does not know what is happening because it cancelled a commitment to send a ship to monitor the whaling fleet.  24 February 2014 (Anti-Putin protesters of 2012 sentenced to 4 years in prison)  The anti-Putin protesters of 2012 have been sentenced to 4 years in prison, a little less than some US protesters.  24 February 2014 (Economic growth in Africa is going mainly to the rich)  Economic growth in Africa is going mainly to the rich.  I suspect "free trade" and other neoliberal dooH niboR policies that are designed to transfer wealth to the rich.  24 February 2014 (11 million homes are empty in Europe, as many are homeless)  11 million homes are empty in Europe, as many are homeless.  Homeless is still increasing in Ireland.  24 February 2014 (Urgent: Cut the nuclear weapons budget)  US citizens: call on Obama to cut the nuclear weapons budget.  24 February 2014 (NSA snooped on Merkel's aids)  Ever since Obama told the NSA to stop snooping on Angela Merkel, it has snooped on her aides instead to get the same data.  24 February 2014 (Obama's men continue promoting the TPP)  Obama's men continue promoting the TPP with a long string of falsehoods and half-truths.  24 February 2014 (Ukraine now faces threat of IMF shock treatments and "free trade")  Ukraine now faces the threat of IMF shock treatments and "free trade" with the EU.  24 February 2014 (Uganda's president signed the anti-homosexuality and censorship bill)  Uganda's president signed the anti-homosexuality and censorship bill.  24 February 2014 (Artificial intelligence could make massive surveillance even more dangerous)  Artificial intelligence could make massive surveillance even more dangerous.  24 February 2014 (Urgent: Support Yevgeniy Vitishko)  Everyone: support Russian environmentalist Yevgeniy Vitishko.  24 February 2014 (Urgent: Call on the US Olympic Committee to reject BP as a sponsor)  US citizens: call on the US Olympic Committee to reject Billionaire Polluters as a sponsor.  24 February 2014 (Urgent: BP's suspension from new federal contracts)  US citizens: call on the EPA not to lift Billionaire Polluters' suspension from new federal contracts.  Make BP mean Billionaires Punished.  24 February 2014 (Monitoring employees' movements and conversations)  Some US businesses install lots of sensors to monitor employees' movements and conversations.  24 February 2014 (Proposed HTTP 2 spec includes just what the NSA wants)  The proposed HTTP 2 spec includes allowing ISP proxies to decrypt communications between your computer and any web site. Just what the NSA wants!  24 February 2014 (Uganda's president backtracking on anti-homosexuality legislation)  Uganda's president Museveni is backtracking on signing the anti-homosexuality legislation.  The most clearly unjust provision I've seen listed in this law is its prohibition on expressing the position that homosexuality is acceptable. I'm not saying this provision is more unjust than the others (I am not trying to compare them on that dimension), but rather that the injustice of this provision is the most indisputable, because it violates freedom of speech.  24 February 2014 (Nefarious role of US in Ukraine)  In Ukraine, Chaos and Violence Hide Nefarious Role of US.  This article points out a side of the situation which our media tend to ignore; but it seems to ignore the other side which our media focus on. President Yanukovych's thugs were the ones that started shooting the protesters, and as long as they continued, there was no reason to criticize the protesters for shooting back.  24 February 2014 (Civil disobedience)  A lesson in real life for the foolish judges that tell activists they should limit themselves to the ineffective and ignored methods of protest that have not been prohibited.  If any lawful method of protest starts to be effective, the state finds an excuse to ban it or crush it. Consider how the Occupy protests were violently crushed. Now consider the ag-gag bills.  24 February 2014 (Acceleration of global heating worse than expected)  Global heating's reduction of Arctic sea ice has accelerated global heating worse than scientists expected.  23 February 2014 (Arrest of Mexican drug kingpin)  Is drug kingpin Guzm&aacute;n the Mexican state's prisoner or its ally and honored guest?  23 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose imprisonment of protesting nuns)  Everyone: tell the Justice Department that protesting nuns shouldn't be imprisoned while banksters enjoy impunity.  23 February 2014 (Attack on wedding party in Yemen)  It is impossible to tell whether some of the people in the Yemeni wedding party were supporters of al Qa'ida, but even if some were, is it right to attack a wedding party?  23 February 2014 (US military uses foreign sweatshops)  The US military produces propaganda clothing in foreign sweatshops.  23 February 2014 (Egypt's military rulers)  Egypt's military rulers are saying the US is plotting against them while continuing to accept lots of US support.  23 February 2014 (Diseases spreading from honeybees to bumblebees)  Honeybees are spreading diseases to bumblebees.  23 February 2014 (Egyptian soldiers attack alleged terrorists from helicopters)  Egyptian soldiers attacked alleged terrorists from helicopters.  If the people attacked were indeed bombers associated with al-Qa'ida, that's a good reason to arrest and prosecute them; but does Egypt need to attack criminals in Egypt with the army? This attack is the sort of thing one would expect in a civil war.  23 February 2014 (Pension funds that invest in fossil fuels)  Pension funds that invest in fossil fuels are ruining their clients' descendants' lives.  23 February 2014 (The campaign for privatization of US public schools)  The campaign for privatization of US public schools started from a false report of a nonexistent fall in US educational results.  23 February 2014 (Governments promoting dangerous changes in "internet governance")  Governments that want more control over the Internet are using the revelations about government snooping as an excuse to promote dangerous changes in "internet governance."  23 February 2014 (A report from Venezuela)  A report from Venezuela.  23 February 2014 (Athabasca River in Alberta is being contaminated by waste from tar sands oil)  The Athabasca River in Alberta is being contaminated by waste from tar sands oil, which was disposed of in the cheapest possible way: dumped on the ground.  23 February 2014 (Urgent: Preserve funding for vital conservation programs)  US citizens: call on Congress to preserve funding for vital conservation programs.  23 February 2014 (UK gov't still denies that its policies have pushed many Britons into hunger)  The UK government still denies that its policies have pushed many Britons into hunger, and still pretends that they are poor because they are lazy, as an excuse to waste their time applying for an inadequate quantity of jobs.  Food banks are admirable, but their inadequacy demonstrates the need for adequate government aid for the poor.  23 February 2014 (Anti-Putin protesters convicted of "rioting" and attacking thugs)  Anti-Putin protesters from 2012 have been convicted of "rioting" and attacking thugs.  It's probably the "He hit my stick with his head" accusation that thugs around the world like to make after they attack someone. Even in the US, courts tend to believe the thugs if there's no hard evidence to the contrary.  23 February 2014 (Law to make schools protect personal data of students)  California is considering a law to make schools protect personal data of students.  The proposal is well-meaning, but I think its provisions are inadequate because the US government will find some way to collect that personal data.  The law really should order schools not to release data about their students to any one except the student, or to another school that the student wishes to enroll in.  23 February 2014 (Fix the Debt's campaign has failed)  Fix the Debt's campaign to cut government spending on the non-rich has failed.  However, if Obama is presenting a smaller deficit as an improvement, rather than a sign of a failure to stimulate the economy, he is still a right-wing influence.  23 February 2014 (Urgent: demand an end to (illegal) threats against whistleblower John Kiriakou)  US citizens: phone the Bureau of Prisons to demand an end to (illegal) threats against whistleblower John Kiriakou.  23 February 2014 (The IRS proposals for campaign spending)  The IRS proposals for campaign spending by 501(c)(4) organizations don't go far enough to stop them from filtering dark money from billionaires and businesses.  23 February 2014 (FCC is trying to defend network neutrality with half-measures)  The FCC is trying to defend network neutrality with half-measures instead of the common carrier status that really should apply.  23 February 2014 (Venezuela is filtering the internet as a reaction to the protests)  Venezuela is filtering the internet as a reaction to the protests.  23 February 2014 (Urgent: Do not allow drilling for oil in Arctic waters)  US citizens: tell the Secretary of the Interior not to allow drilling for oil in Arctic waters.  23 February 2014 (Killed for being used by Facebook)  Islamist fanatics in Syria reportedly killed a girl for being used by Facebook.  Being used by Facebook is bad enough &mdash; these people need help quitting, not punishment.  23 February 2014 (Judge Tosses Muslim Spying Suit Against NYPD)  Judge Tosses Muslim Spying Suit Against NYPD, Says Any Damage Was Caused by Reporters Who Exposed It.  23 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose the Keystone XL pipeline)  Everyone: call on Ms Clinton to heed Jeffrey Sachs and oppose the Keystone XL pipeline.  23 February 2014 (Recommendations for UK NHS)  Recommendations for what the UK NHS should do to allay fears of misuse of people's medical records.  I think this does not go far enough. No companies should be given access to any of this data. We can't trust pharma companies to investigate the effects of their own drugs, so that work should be done by universities with no direct contact with the company.  23 February 2014 (Peace deal in Ukraine)  In Ukraine, the protesters and the president have made a long-term peace deal.  23 February 2014 (Urgent: Stop allowing veto of judge nominees by a solitary senator)  US citizens: call on Senator Leahy to change the practice that enables a solitary Republican senator to veto a judge nominee.  23 February 2014 (Urgent: Ban practice of feeding antibiotics to livestock)  US citizens: tell the FDA to ban the practice of feeding antibiotics to livestock even when they are not sick.  23 February 2014 (Plans for systematic tracking of drivers in the US)  The Committee for Public Safety &mdash; oops, Department of Homeland Security &mdash; has not canceled its plans for systematic tracking of drivers via license plate recognition.  It should be illegal for companies to systematically accumulate records of license plates unless they are (1) invalid or (2) subject to specific surveillance orders issued by a court.  23 February 2014 (Ukraine may be in process of splitting up)  Ukraine's parliament removed President Yanukovych, but the country may be in the process of splitting up anyway.  Accusations that Germany and the US are paying protesters in Ukraine.  23 February 2014 (Ecological consequences of a new canal through Nicaragua)  A new canal through Nicaragua could cause tremendous ecological damage and is likely to be of no benefit to most Nicaraguans.  Container shipping has no need for a canal. The containers can be offloaded at one coast, then shipped by rail to the other coast. This would require a little more work, but (with a fast train line) could even reduce shipping time.  23 February 2014 (Hot weather, violent crime and theft)  A study concludes that hot weather increases violent crime and theft.  Global heating might then lead to an increase, though it is not certain that the effects of week-to-week temperature variation would apply also to a permanent temperature rise.  23 February 2014 (Supposed limits on US surveillance of journalists' communications)  Supposed limits on US surveillance of journalists' communications are meaningless because they don't apply to using the PAT RIOT act against journalists.  23 February 2014 (AT&amp;T's misleading surveillance report)  AT&amp;T's surveillance report is more misleading than accurate, because it omits 80 million NSA targets.  23 February 2014 (Algorithmic prison)  Welcome to Algorithmic Prison.  23 February 2014 (Entrapment mills in the US)  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives operated entrapment mills across the US.  23 February 2014 (Proposed ban on aiding military interrogations fails to pass)  A proposed ban on aiding military interrogations won 53% of the votes at the American Psychological Association's conference, but failed because it needed a 2/3 majority to pass.  23 February 2014 (Egyptian thugs cram 45 prisoners into van and bomb them with tear gas)  Egyptian thugs crammed 45 prisoners into a van meant for 24, left them for hours in intense heat without water or air, then finished off most of them with a tear gas bomb.  Then, of course, the thugs made up lies to excuse this.  23 February 2014 (Urgent: Respect for wildlife refuge on Merritt Island)  US citizens: call on the FAA to respect the wildlife refuge on Merritt Island.  23 February 2014 (Urgent: Regulate emissions of methane)  US citizens: call for regulating emissions of methane.  23 February 2014 (Family made ill and displaced by tar sands industry)  Meet The Family The Tar Sands Industry Wants To Keep Quiet.  23 February 2014 (Thug shoots teenager after mistaking Wii controller for gun)  Cop Allegedly Shot And Killed Teenage Boy After Mistaking His Wii Controller For A Gun.  The important issue is not the mistake made on this one occasion but the general factors that make such mistakes likely.  23 February 2014 (The claim that raising minimum wage will cost jobs)  The Troubling Fine Print In The Claim That Raising The Minimum Wage Will Cost Jobs.  23 February 2014 (Influence of oil money on Texas legislature)  Saturated with Oil Money, Texas Legislature Saved Industry from Pollution Rule.  23 February 2014 (US courts moving to discard the "third party" doctrine)  US courts are moving to discard the "third party" doctrine which says that people have no "expectation of privacy" in information that they provide to a "third party".  If this change is universally adopted, it will only partly reduce the harm done by accumulating massive digital dossiers about everyone.  23 February 2014 (Spying on email between FARC peace negotiators and foreign journalists)  Colombia spied on email between FARC peace negotiators and foreign journalists.  The FARC is Colombia's second-worst terrorist group. The worst one is the army-backed paramilitaries.  22 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose plans for Navy sonar exercises)  US citizens: call on the Navy to drop its plans for sonar exercises that will kill lots of marine mammals.  22 February 2014 (Prostitutes in Italy demand right to pay tax to get a pension)  Prostitutes in Italy demand the right to pay tax and get a pension.  22 February 2014 (America's Highest Paid Government Workers)  New Report Exposes America's Highest Paid Government Workers.  22 February 2014 (Wal-Mart won't give workers a raise)  Wal-Mart firmly denies the idea that it will give its workers a raise.  However, the worst thing about working for Wal-Mart is that it usually is too few hours to make a living, and has no benefits or job security.  22 February 2014 (Urgent: Support EU Net Neutrality)  EU citizens: call on certain MEPs to support a specific aspect of network neutrality when they vote on Feb 24.  22 February 2014 (Plastic food packaging leaches hormone-disrupting substances)  People are exposed to low levels of toxic and hormone-disrupting substances throughout their lives, as they leach into food from plastic packaging. There is very little research into the effects of this.  It is a difficult question to study; there is no way to do a controlled experiment, and it is hard to find comparable populations that differ mainly in how much they keep food and beverages in plastic packaging.  22 February 2014 (Press under Threat on Anniversary of Libyan Revolution)  Press under Threat on Anniversary of Libyan Revolution.  22 February 2014 (Journalist reports that someone was messing with his word processor)  Journalist Luke Harding reports that someone was messing with his word processor as he wrote a book about Snowden.  22 February 2014 (Urgent: Advocate changes going the opposite of fast track)  US citizens: call on Rep Pelosi and Senator Reid to advocate changes going the opposite of fast track.  22 February 2014 (Privatization of electricity in Australia)  Privatization of electricity in parts of Australia turned out to be inefficient: it caused prices there to shoot up.  High prices of electricity might have a positive effect: incentivizing conservation efforts. But it would have been better to do that with a tax increase, rather than giving away the increase to private parties.  22 February 2014 (Right-Wingers warn of the danger of a "wage explosion")  Wages in Australia have been falling, but right-wingers warn of the danger of a "wage explosion".  This is standard right-wing tactic.  22 February 2014 (Australia has put refugees in danger)  Australia has put refugees in danger by leaking their personal data to the countries they fled from.  22 February 2014 (Urgent: Opt out of the UK's lax medical records sharing system)  In the UK: opt out of the UK's lax medical records sharing system.  22 February 2014 (Islamic oppression reaches a new extreme)  Islamic oppression reaches a new extreme: in Saudi Arabia, women are not allowed to go to a medical clinic without a male guardian.  22 February 2014 (Bill to restrict local thugs from acquiring armored vehicles, machine guns, and so on)  New Hampshire is considering a bill to restrict local thugs from acquiring armored vehicles, machine guns, and so on.  The local citizens would be empowered to permit exceptions.  Let's have this in every state!  22 February 2014 (Criticizing "voluntourism")  Criticizing "voluntourism": don't think that your brief participation in an aid project will be constructive if you don't have a special skill to do the job.  22 February 2014 (HIV denialists are using the DMCA)  HIV denialists are using the DMCA to censor criticism of their video.  22 February 2014 (Arrested and beat up a man for helping people)  Vindictive San Francisco thugs arrested and beat up a man for helping people who had a bicycle accident.  22 February 2014 (Some poor Venezuelans have joined in protests)  Some poor Venezuelans have joined in protests.  22 February 2014 (It would take many Snowdens)  It would take many Snowdens to give Americans a picture of all the things the US government is secretly doing that might be dangerous.  22 February 2014 (Snipers killed protesters in Kiev)  Snipers killed protesters in Kiev.  Ukrainian thugs burned down the internet tent at the protest camp.  The western part of Ukraine is starting to break away.  Naturally, the government calls the protesters "terrorists".  I hear that some sort of deal has been made.  22 February 2014 (Ethiopian woman raped in Sudan won't be executed)  The Ethiopian woman raped in Sudan won't be executed, but faces a fine she surely cannot pay.  22 February 2014 (Journalists are now on trial in Egypt for their journalism)  Al-Jazeera journalists are now on trial in Egypt for their journalism.  22 February 2014 (South Africa tried to force a gay rights activist unto a flight to Uganda)  South Africa tried to force a gay rights activist unto a flight to Uganda where he would face imprisonment for his political views.  22 February 2014 (US Must Account for 'Turning Wedding Into a Funeral')  Drone Report: US Must Account for 'Turning Wedding Into a Funeral'.  22 February 2014 (If our frack well explodes, you get a free pizza!)  Chevron: if our frack well explodes, you get a free pizza!  22 February 2014 (The copyright on The Hindus)  Readers have served Penguin India with a demand to surrender the copyright on The Hindus if it is not going to publish the book there.  I wonder if Doniger's contract says the rights revert to her when the book goes out of print.  22 February 2014 (Billionaire plans to support candidates that intend to curb global heating)  The existence of one billionaire who plans to support candidates that intend to curb global heating does not make it ok to let billionaires determine the results of elections.  22 February 2014 (Massive extinction at the end of the Permian period)  The massive extinction at the end of the Permian period occurred in a time span between 10,000 and 110,000 years &mdash; rapid in geological time.  One candidate is a supervolcano that emitted tremendous amounts of CO2.  22 February 2014 (Urgent: Bring the minimum wage raise bill to a vote)  US citizens: tell Congress to bring the minimum wage raise bill to a vote.  22 February 2014 (Republican extremist wants more right-wing policies)  A Republican extremist claims he wants to reduce poverty by pushing more of the right-wing policies that have increased poverty in the US so far.  22 February 2014 (Rand Paul on NSA spying)  Rand Paul: telling Americans that the NSA spies on us all does not make it right to do so.  I disagree with his "cheating spouse" analogy, since I do not believe monogamy should be a requirement for love.  22 February 2014 (Why right-wing ideologues deny global heating)  Right-wing ideologues deny global heating because confronting it requires massive governmental activity.  This is not to say there is no room for markets in preventing this disaster. One of the advantages of the carbon tax is that it puts the free market to work in reducing emissions.  22 February 2014 (Massive surveillance of forests)  One good use of massive surveillance surveils forests rather than people.  21 February 2014 (Injustice of the TPP)  A web comic explains the injustice of the TPP.  Even if we defeat the TPP, we should not forget the politicians who are trying to inflict it on us. They have proved they are on the wrong side, the 1%'s side.  21 February 2014 (Ukrainian protesters defeat riot thugs)  Ukrainian protesters defeated riot thugs to take control of Independence Square, but it seems the right-wing extremists are taking the lead among them.  21 February 2014 (Delusional man faces death penalty in Pakistan for blasphemy)  A delusional man faces the death penalty in Pakistan for blasphemy.  This law is the reason I will not go to Pakistan. Nobody should go there.  21 February 2014 (The protests in Venezuela)  More about the protests in Venezuela.  I do not find it implausible that the US has helped organize the protests. I do not find it implausible that a provocateur (either working for the Venezuelan government or working for the US) has killed people on both sides.  In any case, it is clearly wrong to prosecute the leader of a protest because violence breaks out later. This resembles what the US did to the Haymarket martyrs.  21 February 2014 (Whistleblower at Hanford nuclear facility fired)  The cleanup manager at the Hanford nuclear facility was fired after informing the public about safety faults.  Previous whistleblowers were fired, too. I guess we can't believe anything the employees say unless they get fired.  21 February 2014 (Volkswagen workers bullied by Republican state politicians)  Republican state politicians in Tennessee bullied Volkswagen workers, who then voted not to unionize.  21 February 2014 (Minimum wage needs to be combined with a welfare system)  Republicans have seized on a study that predicts that increasing the minimum wage would eliminate 500,000 jobs but lift 900,000 workers out of poverty.  The minimum wage needs to be combined with a welfare system for those who are unemployed. That way, all low-paid workers benefit, whether they are still working or not.  To work out an example, suppose half a million jobs are eliminated, and 50 million minimum-wage workers get a raise. If those workers pay 3% of their increase in income as tax, that would cover the costs of supporting the other half-million, and all will be better off than they are now.  This sort of system to transfer income from the rich (who have grabbed an ever-increasing share) to the rest is exactly what we need.  21 February 2014 (New land-grab for US farmland by big companies)  A new land-grab for US farmland by big companies threatens to increase consolidation and could make working conditions worse.  20 February 2014 (G8 Brings Big Ag Colonialism to Africa)  G8 Brings Big Ag Colonialism to Africa  It's the usual neoliberal "solution": big foreign companies lobby for permission to "invest", which means taking control.  The G8 New Alliance facilitates investors' "access to land", which means local people lose their land and end up in penury.  Another aspect is pushing farmers to seeds they can't reproduce. This makes them dependent on agribusiness and reduces diversity.  The G8 New Alliance also threatens Ethiopia's distributed seed bank.  20 February 2014 (Australia giving away natural resources to foreign mining companies)  Australia is practically giving away its natural resources to foreign mining companies.  I would guess that a few strategically chosen Australians receive some of those profits.  20 February 2014 (Urgent: Bringing back postal banking)  US citizens: sign this petition for bringing back postal banking.  20 February 2014 (Ecuador's oil drilling)  Ecuador's oil drilling in the Yasuni National Park is supported by roads it calls "trails", as it pushes indigenous people off their land. To cover up the truth, it restricts access by journalists.  I would not criticize Ecuador for starting the planning to exploit the area before formally announcing failure of its plan to permanently protect the area. That plan depended on donations from wealthier countries, and it was already clear that the funds requested were not forthcoming. Its failure was not Ecuador's fault.  However, it appears that Ecuador treated this as more than a contingency plan.  Meanwhile, Chevron, which is grasping at even imaginary straws to get out of its judgment for pollution in Ecuador, is twisting the RICO law to claim that any criticism of Chevron is "racketeering".  20 February 2014 (Urgent: Extend unemployment benefits by cutting the war budget)  US citizens: call for extending unemployment benefits by cutting the war budget.  20 February 2014 (Kellogg has agreed to buy palm oil only from suppliers that protect wildlife and human rights)  Kellogg has agreed to buy palm oil only from suppliers that protect wildlife and human rights.  We will have to keep after Kellogg to truly implement this agreement, since it will have an incentive to wink at abuses. However, what worries me even more is that the unethical suppliers will simply sell to other companies. To stop the deforestation caused by palm oil requires systematic enforcement not dependent on one purchaser.  20 February 2014 (Residents resisting attempt to evict them all for an ecotourism scheme)  Residents of Ile a Vache, Haiti, are resisting an attempt to evict them all for an ecotourism scheme.  20 February 2014 (Ukraine thugs attacked 20 journalists as well as many civilian protesters)  The Ukraine thugs attacked 20 journalists as well as many civilian protesters.  The fighting in Kiev was started by thugs who had been positioned as snipers.  20 February 2014 (Comcast regularly mistreats its broadband customers)  Comcast regularly mistreats its broadband customers.  If it gets permission to merge and get bigger, this can only get worse.  20 February 2014 (Urgent: Support use of eminent domain to rescue US home owners)  US citizens: call on the Federal Housing Finance Agency to support the use of eminent domain to rescue US home owners from the banksters.  20 February 2014 (The Australian shark cull)  The Australian shark cull is driven by the aim of reducing tiny risks to zero, together with exaggeration of those risks, stirred up by sensationalist media.  It's too bad we don't attend with similar determination to the really big risks: obesity, environmental pollution, plutocracy and its consequent often-deadly poverty, and global heating.  20 February 2014 (Deal between protesters and Ukrainian gov't breaks down)  A deal between protesters and the government broke down and thugs attacked the protesters, who fought back.  20 February 2014 (Guatemala's attorney general forced to leave office early)  Guatemala's attorney general, who prosecuted the corrupt and genocidal elite, has been forced to leave office early.  20 February 2014 (Thugs use whips to break up Pussy Riot performance)  Thugs broke up a Pussy Riot performance by attacking the performers with whips.  20 February 2014 (US protesters sentenced to as much as 5 years in prison)  US protesters for nuclear disarmament have been sentenced to as much as 5 years in prison.  The "sabotage" they were convicted of was symbolic.  Keep this in mind when other countries threaten large penalties against protesters. It's equally wrong when the US does it.  20 February 2014 (Urgent: Reject the idea that presidents are allowed to kill at will)  US citizens: reject the idea that presidents are allowed to kill at will.  20 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose letting poultry agribusinesses inspect their own chickens)  US citizens: call on the Department of Agriculture not to let poultry agribusinesses inspect their own chickens.  That would be letting the fox watch the henhouse.  20 February 2014 (Venezuelan opposition leader surrenders to state)  Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo L&oacute;pez has surrendered to the state, daring the state to prosecute him.  I don't know what his political platform is. I suspect it is to benefit foreign businesses and their local allies, which I do not support at all. Nonetheless, he is also standing for political freedom, in a short-term sense. Maduro had better get behind this too.  20 February 2014 (The erroneous idea that everyone needs to be good at math)  On the erroneous idea that everyone needs to be good at math.  Speaking as one who loves math as it ought to be loved &mdash; for its beauty &mdash; I agree with the article. My knowledge of mathematical logic informs me that it is a fallacy to think that "There are mathematical jobs available now for workers who are good at math" implies "If everyone were good at math, there would be mathematical jobs for everyone."  The US, especially, has no need to increase workers' productivity. Its production is high enough. The US needs to change the economic system so that everyone can have a decent life, not just the small fraction whose labor is still in high demand.  20 February 2014 (Why same-sex marriage rights have gained so much in the US)  Now we see why same-sex marriage rights have gained so much in the US: businesses want to be able to hire gay professionals.  Legalizing same-sex marriage is the right thing to do. But if we need to depend on business support to win for a worthy cause, we can't defeat the plutocrats' class war that is driving most Americans, gay or straight, into poverty.  The Casualty of America's Same-Sex Marriage Fight: Civil Unions.  20 February 2014 (North Carolina riverbed coated by toxic coal ash)  North Carolina riverbed coated by toxic coal ash, officials say.  20 February 2014 (UK makes the poor futilely apply for jobs at grueling pace)  The UK's excuse to crush the poor is to demand they futilely apply for jobs at a grueling pace, or be left to starve.  This "culture of fear" often leads to hunger and homelessness.  20 February 2014 (Refuting the apologists for the 1%'s class war)  Refuting the apologists for the 1%'s class war. 19 February 2014 ("Free trade" agreements block vital regulations on banks)  "Free trade" agreements block vital regulations on banks.  19 February 2014 (Where Syrian Islamists take control, they oppress)  Where Syrian Islamists take control, they oppress women, and men too.  19 February 2014 (UK court ruled in favor of the interrogation of David Miranda)  A UK court ruled in favor of the interrogation of David Miranda even though it was intended to interfere with press freedom.  Laws that authorize oppression are typical of unjust regimes. All that court did was confirm, yet again, that the UK is one of them.  19 February 2014 (Proposed "European internet" not meant to protect from massive surveillance)  The proposed "European internet" is not meant to protect Europeans from massive surveillance.  19 February 2014 (Right to repair digital products)  South Dakota is considering a law to give purchasers of digital products a right to be able to repair them.  19 February 2014 (US gov't has published a falsified history of the Vietnam War)  The US government has published a falsified history of the Vietnam War &mdash; a work of propaganda directed at misleading future generations of Americans.  19 February 2014 (Mozilla is planning to put advertising into Firefox)  Mozilla is planning to put advertising into Firefox, and talking about it in ways that don't acknowledge that.  19 February 2014 (Ethiopian gov't snuck spyware into exile's computer through a Word file)  The Ethiopian government snuck spyware into an Ethiopian exile's computer through a Word file.  This is one of many reasons you should refuse to open a Word file.  19 February 2014 (FEMA falsified the flood risk for 500 rich people's seaside mansions)  FEMA falsified the flood risk for 500 rich people's seaside mansions so they could get cheap government flood insurance at our expense.  19 February 2014 (An Ethiopian migrant in Sudan faces capital charges for getting raped)  An Ethiopian migrant in Sudan faces capital charges for getting raped.  19 February 2014 (Wikipedia Mounts Courtroom Defense for Editor Sued by Politician)  Wikipedia Mounts Courtroom Defense for Editor Sued by Politician.  The editor (i.e., contributor) was ordered to delete the text that he wrote in that politician's page, and did so, but others restored it immediately. The judge does not seem to understand this.  19 February 2014 (Banksters hired by the White House to work on the TPP)  Two banksters get lots of money from Bank of America and Citigroup and then were hired by the White House to work on the TPP.  This is the worst kind of corruption of the government.  19 February 2014 (Former members of Pussy Riot were arrested in Sochi)  Former members of Pussy Riot were arrested in Sochi, apparently to prevent a hypothetical protest.  Sochi is under special Olympic repression that is worse than the usual repression of Russia.  19 February 2014 (Proprietary software developer fights with other proprietary software developers)  One proprietary software developer fights with other proprietary software developers, with the user's computer as battlefield.  19 February 2014 (Censorship of Wendy Doniger's book, The Hindus, in India)  Wendy Doniger's book, The Hindus, has been "recalled" in India by its publisher, which was threatened legally by a Hindu militant group that didn't like the book.  More information.  The censorship has extended to web downloads.  This act of censorship has provoked a world-wide reaction.  Many important works are banned in India, including the book Lajja by Taslima Nasrin which describes persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh.  18 February 2014 (Corporate Cronyism)  Corporate Cronyism: The Secret to Overpaid CEOs.  18 February 2014 (How NSA combines phone call data with internet contact data)  How the NSA combines phone call data with internet contact data to collect more information about Americans in general.  18 February 2014 (UK thugs face criminal charges for arresting protester)  Two UK thugs face criminal charges for arresting a student protester.  18 February 2014 (High-tech fishing operations)  High-tech fishing operations are leaving Senegal's traditional fishers with no fish.  18 February 2014 (Ray McGovern suing CIA for putting him on a watch list)  Ray McGovern is suing the CIA for putting him on a watch list because of his lawful political activity.  18 February 2014 (True Free Market Proponents Should Support Private-Public Competition)  True Free Market Proponents Should Support Private-Public Competition.  18 February 2014 (Antidemocracy movement in Thailand attacked)  The antidemocracy movement in Thailand attacked with guns and teargas.  18 February 2014 (Petition against water privatization)  Over a million EU citizens have filed an initiative petition against water privatization.  The legal effect of the initiative is only to direct the European Union to consider the issue. We will have to see whether this has more influence than a petition on whitehouse.gov.  18 February 2014 (Students in Venezuela have been protesting for days against Maduro's government)  University students in Venezuela have been protesting for days against Maduro's government, and a leader of the opposition has been accused of terrorism.  Several other South American countries condemned the protesters' violence.  I can well believe that US diplomats are plotting to overthrow the government of Venezuela. The US supported the coup attempt a decade ago. However, the shortages, caused by price controls, and other real grievances are stimulating real opposition.  Accusing protesters of "terrorism" is wrong in Venezuela just as it's wrong in the US or Russia or Egypt.  18 February 2014 (Sousveillance can become self-implemented surveillance)  Sousveillance in a competitive situation can become, in effect, a form of nearly obligatory self-implemented surveillance.  18 February 2014 (Urgent: Stop selling Roundup)  Everyone: call on Monsanto to stop selling its wildlife-destroying pesticide, Roundup.  18 February 2014 (Was Snowden Justified?)  Debate: Was Snowden Justified? Former NSA Counsel Stewart Baker vs. Whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg.  18 February 2014 (US and UK surveillance specifically targeted Wikileaks)  US and UK surveillance specifically targeted Wikileaks.  18 February 2014 (Banks made tremendous money from fees on credit card payments)  US banks make tremendous money from the fees on credit card payments.  In addition, when you use a credit card, they get data about your purchases. That's more important to me than the 2% fee. Don't be tracked, pay cash!  18 February 2014 (Frequency of heat waves exceeded)  The frequency of heat waves in parts of Australia has already exceeded what was forecast for 2030.  18 February 2014 (Kerry gave strong speech about danger of global heating)  Kerry gave a strong speech about the danger of global heating.  Will he practice what he preached, and kill the Keystone XL pipeline?  18 February 2014 (Free enterprise flaws)  Free enterprise does a great job&hellip;except for certain giant and sometimes deadly flaws.  18 February 2014 (Floods in England exacerbated by farm deregulation)  Farm deregulation, based on right-wing pander-to-business ideology, exacerbated the floods in England.  18 February 2014 (Fossil fuel use is subsidized almost 2 trillion dollars a year)  Fossil fuel use is subsidized almost 2 trillion dollars a year, which makes renewable energy appear discouragingly expensive.  18 February 2014 (Karzai to change domestic abuse law)  Karzai said he will change the law that would have stopped abused women from testifying against the relatives that did it.  18 February 2014 (Right-wing claims bigotry is expression of religious freedom)  The latest right-wing bigotry tactic is to claim bigotry is an expression of religious freedom.  18 February 2014 (Venezuela bans Colombian TV channel)  Venezuela banned a Colombian TV channel which was the only one that gave substantial coverage to anti-government protests.  18 February 2014 (Urgent: Clarify IRS rules about electioneering by nonprofits)  US citizens: support clarifying IRS rules about electioneering by nonprofits.  18 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose bill that bans states from mandating GMO labeling)  US citizens: oppose the bill to ban states from mandating GMO labeling.  18 February 2014 (Urgent: Government By The People Act)  US citizens: phone to ask your Congresscritter to cosponsor the Government By The People Act.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  18 February 2014 (Paris censors street artist)  Paris Censors Street Artist Who Criticized Anti-Piracy Law.  18 February 2014 (Dangerous jump in births in Egypt in 2012)  Egypt in 2012 experienced a dangerous jump in births.  This was perhaps due to Morsi's policies.  18 February 2014 (Gay rights activist in Sochi arrested for nondisruptive protest)  Gay rights activist Vladimir Luxuria was arrested for a nondisruptive protest in Sochi.  Banning any point of view is an offense against human rights.  18 February 2014 (UK agents harass Edward Snowden's lawyer)  The US had subservient UK agents harass Jesselyn Radack, Edward Snowden's lawyer, as she was going to the UK.  They told her she is on a sort of US no-fly list, the "inhibited persons" list. Perhaps as a lawyer she appears "inhibited" when asked to talk about her clients' affairs.  18 February 2014 (Kim Jong-un could face charges of crimes against humanity)  The UN warns Kim Jong-un that he could face charges at The Hague for crimes against humanity.  Here are details of the charges.  Even if the Security Council approves the charges, I see no way the court could have a chance of getting him and trying him. Still, this recognition of how monstrous North Korea is may do some good.  18 February 2014 (How Privatization Perverts Education)  How Privatization Perverts Education.  18 February 2014 ("Libertarians" who earned fortunes from the gov't)  5 Obnoxious Libertarian Oligarchs Who Earned Fortunes from the Government They'd Like to Destroy.  18 February 2014 (Australia taught by US to spy on Indonesian gov't)  The US taught Australia how to spy on the Indonesian government about its position in a trade dispute with the US.  If the trade dispute was the one about clove-flavored cigarettes, Indonesia deserves no sympathy for insisting the US allow those deadly addictive products. Trade treaties are being used world-wide to block measures to discourage smoking, which is an additional reason those treaties must be abolished. But these treaties and the surveillance are different issues.  17 February 2014 (Urgent: Repeal "stand your ground" laws)  US citizens: call for repeal of "stand your ground" laws that provide an excuse for what is effectively murder.  17 February 2014 (Urgent: Reject politicization of the NSF grant procedure)  US citizens: tell Congress to reject politicization of the NSF grant procedure.  17 February 2014 (The CEO of AOL tried to shaft the employees on their benefits)  The CEO of AOL tried to shaft the employees on their benefits because a couple of them had big medical expenses.  In this context, I have to mention that I don't think it serves society's interests to go to such lengths to save a very premature baby which hasn't even started to become a human being. But that does not justify Mr Armstrong's position. There are lots of reasons why employees (or their family members who are already human beings) might need expensive medical care. Also, the point about commercial pressures that lead women to delay having children and thus face greater risks when they do is valid.  17 February 2014 (Gates Foundation's plan for redesigning education in US)  Resistance is growing against the Gates Foundation's plan for redesigning education in the US.  17 February 2014 (The danger of fossil fuels under a right-wing deregulating state)  A series of spills and explosions have highlighted the danger of fossil fuels under a right-wing deregulating state.  Investigating all sorts of dangerous facilities, and punishing infractions with stern rectitude, is one of the many necessary jobs that only a state can do well.  17 February 2014 (The Moral Movement)  The Moral Movement (against right-wing cruelty) brought 80,000 people to Raleigh, North Carolina, and is spreading to other nearby states.  Bravo!  17 February 2014 (Obama's drone assassination program is illegal)  The ACLU warns that Obama's drone assassination program is illegal.  Supposedly, in post-constitutional America, Obama can kill anyone anywhere for any reason.  17 February 2014 (Future global heating in Britain)  Future global heating is likely to cause Britain worse droughts some of the time, as well as worse floods at other times.  17 February 2014 (So you think you have nothing to hide&hellip;)  So you think you have nothing to hide&hellip;  17 February 2014 (Comcast-Time Warner Deal)  Why the Comcast-Time Warner Deal Is Far More Dangerous Than You Think.  17 February 2014 (Obama rewarding donors with ambassadorships)  Obama is rewarding donors with ambassadorships a lot more than his predecessors did.  17 February 2014 (Thugs tased and beat up a deaf man for trying to sign at them)  Thugs in California tased and beat up a deaf man for trying to sign at them.  17 February 2014 (Urgent: Appoint more public interest lawyers as judges)  US citizens: call on Obama to appoint more public interest lawyers as judges rather than corporate lawyers.  17 February 2014 (Gov't trying to intimidate Australian Broadcasting Corporation)  The Australian government is trying to intimidate the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  17 February 2014 (Massive extinction events)  Earth has had six massive extinction events, each apparently for a different cause. This one is caused by humans.  17 February 2014 (Congolese exiles face torture if sent back by UK)  Leaked orders show Congolese exiles face torture if sent back by the UK.  17 February 2014 (Deaths of construction workers in Qatar due to abusive conditions)  400 construction workers have died working on sports facilities in Qatar, due to the abusive conditions. 4000 are expected to be killed by the time they are used in 2022.  17 February 2014 (Wealthier Americans increasingly unwilling to "pay for them")  The wealthier Americans are increasingly unwilling to "pay for them" (i.e., all the rest).  We should not give those arrogant bastards any choice about it.  17 February 2014 (Money taken out of war budget to restore veterans' benefits)  Senator Sanders restored cuts in veterans' pensions by taking the money out of the war budget.  It is a net plus for Americans because military spending (especially overseas military spending) benefits mainly a few businesses and makes few jobs.  17 February 2014 (NY Times adds bias for the sake of appearing unbiased)  The New York Times reported on a sham right-wing "institute", but then for the sake of "balance" criticized Liberal groups that don't do the same thing.  17 February 2014 (The harm done by NAFTA and US-Korea free exploitation treaty)  NAFTA and the US-Korea free exploitation treaty have both done US workers documented harm.  US companies said they would create more jobs if NAFTA were signed, then did the opposite.  17 February 2014 (Child pornography used as excuse for internet censorship)  "Child pornography is great" &mdash; as an excuse for internet censorship.  17 February 2014 (The Mobsters of Wall Street)  The Mobsters of Wall Street.  17 February 2014 (Urgent: Restore Snowden's passport)  US citizens: call on the US to restore Snowden's passport.  17 February 2014 (US now allows banks to deal with state-legalized marijuana businesses)  The US now allows banks to deal with state-legalized marijuana businesses.  17 February 2014 (Urgent: Call on US to promise no foul play against Snowden)  Everyone: call on the US to promise no foul play against Snowden.  17 February 2014 (Fish farms accused of destroying wild salmon in Scotland)  Fish farms accused of destroying wild salmon in Scotland.  17 February 2014 (Urgent: Support Don't Spy on US campaign)  UK citizens: support the Don't Spy on US campaign.  This campaign does not go far enough, but it is worth supporting anyway.  17 February 2014 (Privatization is costly and harmful)  US cities and states are discovering that privatization is costly and harmful.  A private operator has a financial incentive not to do the whole job. If it sells to the public in a competitive market, people will judge it on that. Otherwise, it will screw people without restraint.  17 February 2014 (Urgent: Support network neutrality)  EU citizens: talk with your MEPs to support network neutrality.  17 February 2014 (Uganda's law censoring "promotion of homosexuality" has been approved)  Uganda's law censoring "promotion of homosexuality" and imposing prison for any touching in public has been approved.  The influence of genes on homosexuality is not a secure base for arguing for equal rights for homosexuals.  I think the issue is simple. People who don't want to have sex with you have a right not to have sex with you, and aside from that it's none of their business who you have sex with.  17 February 2014 (Global heating denialist tactic)  A global heating denialist tactic is to misrepresent the consensus of nearly all climate scientists and pretend it is something very weak.  17 February 2014 (Efforts to confirm indigenous people's land rights are stalling)  As business increasingly looks for land grabs, efforts to confirm indigenous people's land rights are stalling.  17 February 2014 (The Syrian peace talks are hopelessly deadlocked)  The Syrian peace talks are hopelessly deadlocked.  No one has any idea of a feasible form of intervention that would make things better.  17 February 2014 (Muslim extremist banned from preaching)  A British Muslim extremist, perhaps a convert (judging from his name), has been banned from preaching on pain of arrest.  Incitement to murder is legitimately punished. This man's "vigilante patrols" may have included attacking passers-by. (Some such Islamist vigilantism in Britain has done that.) If he advocates Shari'a law, then he has no respect for others' human rights. He is evidently an example of the tendency for religions to inspire hatred, which is common today in Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism.  But that doesn't justify banning him from stating his views, which is not a crime. That tramples his human rights.  The UK fails to distinguish between "discrimination and persecution" and stating a political position.  17 February 2014 (Turkish gov't taking control of the judiciary)  The Turkish government is taking control of the judiciary so as to resist corruption charges against relatives of ministers.  15 February 2014 (In Dubai, the law makes every battered wife a prisoner)  In Dubai, the law makes every battered wife a prisoner.  15 February 2014 (US mainstream media)  When US politicians stimulate fear of terrorism in order to take more control, the US mainstream media support them.  15 February 2014 (Thugs shot Eugene Mallory to death, then made false accusations about him)  Thugs implementing the War on Drugs shot Eugene Mallory to death in his bed, then made false accusations about him (as usual).  15 February 2014 (Former FCC commissioner regrets the consolidation)  A former FCC commissioner regrets the media consolidation that the FCC permitted over and over.  15 February 2014 (Water in West Virginia)  Although the water in West Virginia is supposed to be "safe", people are still having horrible reactions to it.  15 February 2014 (Law banning private license plate recorders is being challenged)  A Utah law banning private license plate recorders is being challenged in court.  This sort of law is vitally needed to curb massive surveillance. People must be free to take photos and videos, but companies should not be allowed to systematically watch everyone.  The perverse Corporations United decision (to call it what it really is) in which the Supreme Court ruled that corporations are entitled to human rights may lead to a bad decision on this law. Please support the campaign for a constitutional amendment to cancel that decision.  15 February 2014 (Anti-Drone activist arrested and tortured)  Pakistani anti-drone activist Kareem Khan was arrested and tortured by Pakistani thugs.  15 February 2014 (The History of Surveillance and the Black Community)  The History of Surveillance and the Black Community.  15 February 2014 (Congresscritters in the pocket of the copyright industry)  Congresscritters in the pocket of the copyright industry abolish and create subcommittees to make sure Hollywood has power over you.  I recommend people join in my almost-boycott of Hollywood: never pay to see a movie unless you have some reason to believe it is actually good. While in theory this is not a complete boycott, in practice the difference is small.  15 February 2014 (Too warm to hold winter Olympics again)  Of the 19 places where winter Olympics have been held, 13 will be too warm in 2080 to do so again.  By 2080 I expect the world economy will be too shattered to continue holding events like the Olympic games. Thus, I have to admit that global heating will have occasional minor benefits. However, they will be minuscule compared to the disaster.  15 February 2014 (Thugs who shot innocent women won't even be fired)  The thugs who shot innocent women in LA (while looking for one man) won't even be fired.  15 February 2014 (For US gov't, leaks from people who like drones are good)  For the US government, leaks from people who like drones are good; leaks from people who don't like drones are bad.  15 February 2014 (GMOs Are Killing the Bees, Butterflies, Birds and... ?)  GMOs Are Killing the Bees, Butterflies, Birds and... ?  15 February 2014 (Pensacola makes it illegal for homeless people to use blankets)  The latest clever idea for persecuting homeless people: Pensacola has banned using a blanket or newspaper to protect oneself from the weather.  Everyone who supported that deserves to be sentenced to a year of homelessness.  15 February 2014 (Massive surveillance and confirmation bias of investigators)  Another danger from massive surveillance: once investigators believe someone is guilty of a crime &mdash; any crime &mdash; confirmation bias will encourage them to focus on whichever parts of the surveillance information confirm that suspicion, and ignore the parts that say otherwise.  15 February 2014 (US gov't considers laws requiring remote kill switch in smartphones)  California and the US government are considering laws requiring a remote kill switch and erasure feature in all smartphones.  This would make them even more open to attack by the state.  15 February 2014 (Abuse of state secrets privilege)  Obama said, "We must not protect information merely because it reveals the violation of a law or embarrassment to the government", but that's exactly what the government continues to do.  "How far would [officials] be willing to go to cover up serious crimes such as torture and assassination?"  15 February 2014 (Brazil persecuting sex workers)  Brazil is persecuting sex workers to "clean up its image".  14 February 2014 (Idaho's "Ag-Gag" Law Latest to Criminalize Defenders of Animals)  Idaho's "Ag-Gag" Law Latest to Criminalize Defenders of Animals.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Reject Obama's anti-abortion judge nominee)  US citizens: call on the Senate to reject Obama's anti-abortion judge nominee.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Stand firm against Republican hostage taking)  US citizens: call on congressional Democrats to stand firm against Republican hostage taking.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Object to GM corn designed to be used with Agent Orange)  US citizens: object to GM corn designed to be used with Agent Orange.  14 February 2014 (The Other NRA)  The Other NRA: National Restaurant Association Eviscerates Rights of Customers, Workers, and Children.  14 February 2014 (Natural gas leaks a lot more methane than was previously believed)  Natural gas leaks a lot more methane, and contributes a lot more to global heating, than was previously believed.  14 February 2014 (Ocean heating seems to have caused grave damage to coral reef)  Ocean heating seems to have caused grave damage to an old, remote coral reef whose location keeps it safe from other human-caused depredations.  14 February 2014 (Privatized prison covered up understaffing)  A privatized prison in Idaho covered up its understaffing by fraudulent overbilling.  The million dollar non-fine seems inadequate as a punishment. The company ought to be prosecuted and put in its own prison.  It has been pointed out that one aspect of white privilege is that whites are less likely to be prosecuted for certain crimes than blacks are. By the same criterion, the most privileged class in the US is that of corporations.  14 February 2014 (Comparing protection of elephants with prohibition of drugs)  Comparing protection of elephants with prohibition of drugs.  There is a significant difference between the two. Ivory has no physiological effect; if people like owning ivory, that is just an acquired taste, which they could easily learn to change. Nonetheless, the article could be right.  14 February 2014 (TEPCO Blasted for Withholding Data as Fukushima Radiation Levels Soar)  TEPCO Blasted for Withholding Data as Fukushima Radiation Levels Soar.  14 February 2014 (Almost 6 million Americans can't vote because of previous criminal convictions)  Almost 6 million Americans can't vote because of previous criminal convictions,mainly from minority groups because members of those groups are more likely to be prosecuted. This is enough to change the outcome of elections.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Reject the environmental impact statement for Keystone XL)  US citizens: tell the State Department not to follow its joke of an environmental impact statement for the Keystone XL pipeline, and reject it.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Have the EPA block Pebble Mine)  US citizens: call on Obama to have the EPA block Pebble Mine.  14 February 2014 (A new geological period)  Geologists are seriously considering the idea that humans, through global heating and ecological disruption, have caused a new geological period, which they propose to call the Anthropocene.  I am concerned that the name "Anthropocene" may provoke irrational pride: some humans may think, "An epoch named after US humans proves our importance &mdash; we've really made it now." Even people who would not say this may feel it and be subtly influenced by it. That would be most unfortunate, since considering the epoch as an award would lead people not to recognize this development as the catastrophe that it is.  I therefore suggest choosing another name. The name that best characterizes what's coming in this epoch is "Obscene".  Seriously, since the change consists primarily of global heating, how about "Thermocene"? The heating is caused mainly by combustion (of fossil fuel and forests), so how about "Pyrocene"?  14 February 2014 (Court rules warrant required for access to people's prescriptions)  An ACLU victory: a federal court ruled that the government needs to get a warrant before it can access the confidential data base of people's prescriptions.  It's a step in the right direction, but access is still too easy. The state should not create a centralized data base of everyone's prescriptions.  14 February 2014 (Record pace of school shootings in the US)  School shootings are happening in the US at record pace, and 3/4 of the shooters found their guns at home.  14 February 2014 (Deputy Attorney General's testimony about snooping)  Congresscritters say Deputy Attorney General James Cole's testimony about snooping on their phone calls was "not entirely accurate". It was the usual misleading half-truth.  14 February 2014 (Things you can't do in the US while black)  21 things you can't do in the US while black.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Block merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable)  US citizens: call on the US to block the merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable.  These are the two biggest US cable operators.  It should be a no-brainer to block such a merger, but the US government is too corrupt to be counted on even for no-brainers.  These two companies are both ALEC members, and ALEC supports their lobbying campaigns to eliminate local regulation of cable TV and ban public network access.  14 February 2014 (Freedom to protest in the US is under attack)  Freedom to protest in the US is under systematic attack.  14 February 2014 (Brazilian Landless Workers protest against president's support for agribusiness)  The Brazilian Landless Workers Movement is protesting against President Rousseff's support for agribusiness.  In the 1990s, I was told, activists of this movement were arrested on the pretext that they were using unauthorized copies of Windows. They could not afford authorized copies, of course. Then I heard that they had switched to GNU/Linux to protect themselves.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Tell mainstream media to talk about TPP)  US citizens: tell the mainstream media to start talking about the TPP.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Support Children 404)  Everyone: Support Children 404 and demand Russia drop charges against Elena Klimova.  14 February 2014 (Iran executes Arab poet)  Iran has executed an Arab poet, labeled as "terrorist".  14 February 2014 (Belgium to give children option of euthanasia)  Belgium will give children dying slowly in great pain the option of euthanasia.  14 February 2014 (UK floods part of trend)  The devastating UK floods are part of a trend: 4 of the 5 wettest years ever recorded have occurred since 2000.  14 February 2014 (Loopholes for the rich to cut student loan debt)  Elizabeth Warren Calls for Closing Loopholes for the Rich to Cut Student Loan Debt.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose chained CPI)  US citizens: tell Obama, no chained CPI &mdash; no cuts in Social Security, not even veiled cuts.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Extend the Clean Water Act)  US citizens: call for extending the Clean Water Act to all waterways.  14 February 2014 (Urgent: Keep wolves protected)  US citizens: call on the Fish and Wildlife Service not to delist wolves from protection.  14 February 2014 (USA Freedom Act not enough)  NSA Whistleblower: USA Freedom Act Will Not Go Far Enough To Protect Civil Liberties.  It falls short in other ways too.  We should support it, but we must demand more.  14 February 2014 (Australian plan to kill large sharks violates treaty)  The Australian plan to kill large sharks violates a treaty meant to protect migratory endangered species such as the great white shark.  14 February 2014 (ISP lobbyists pressured legislatures to ban public broadband)  ISP lobbyists have pressured (or paid?) 20 states' legislatures to ban public broadband.  14 February 2014 (US Republicans' "concern" about future generations)  If US Republicans are serious in their concern for future generations, they should protect them from global heating disaster.  This reasoning won't influence congressional Republicans, because they don't care about future generations except for the wealthy. Their pretended concern is nothing but an excuse to kick the poor today.  14 February 2014 (Protest in Bosnia against privatization)  The protests in Bosnia are aimed at privatization which (as usual) was done so as to screw the non-rich, and at the corruption of the state.  I don't know the facts, but my guess is that some of the ex-Yugoslav industries should have been privatized, because they made products for a competitive market. That doesn't justify cheating the workers. Perhaps they should have been turned into worker cooperatives.  14 February 2014 (Nonviolent protester faces three years in prison in Russia)  Russian environmentalist Evgeny Vitishko faces three years in prison for spray-painting on a fence.  Similar repression of nonviolent protest is found also in the US.  14 February 2014 (2014 World Press Freedom Index)  Biggest Rises and Falls in the 2014 World Press Freedom Index.  14 February 2014 (Music factories trying to force ISP to punish customers for sharing)  The big music factories are trying to force a major Irish ISP to start punishing customers accused of sharing.  To make a deal with the copyright industry is self-delusion. If you try to "meet them half way", they come back later and demand the rest.  13 February 2014 (Yellen acknowledges "economic recovery" failed to provide jobs)  Janet Yellen acknowledged that the US "economic recovery" has failed to provide jobs.  While I am glad Yellen recognizes the problem, interest rates have little leverage for correcting it. Low interest rates help banksters make more money, but they have no reason to put this into the rest of the economy. What we need is to expand deficit spending. When Obama endorsed the Republicans' goal of deficit cutting, he screwed the US until we replace him.  14 February 2014 (Stasi collected metadata too)  The Stasi, the East German secret police, collected metadata too. But it could not collect everyone's metadata as the US does.  14 February 2014 (Obama considering assassination of an American in a country where the US is not at war)  Obama is considering launching an assassination of an American in a country where the US is not at war.  The fact that no attempt has been made to charge that person with a crime adds to the scandal, but if there were charges against that person, that would not justify summary execution.  14 February 2014 (CIA drone attacks)  More about how CIA drone attacks are aimed at SIM cards identified based on metadata.  14 February 2014 (Glenn Greenwald says he will not remain in exile forever)  Glenn Greenwald says he will not remain in exile forever, even though the US government refuses to say whether he will be prosecuted for his journalism.  14 February 2014 (Mass surveillance endangers journalism)  The Committee to Protect Journalists warns that mass surveillance endangers journalism.  13 February 2014 (The Israeli army)  Israeli soldiers shot and killed unarmed Mohammad Mahmoud Mubarak as he was busy directing traffic. Then they claimed he has shot at them first, although he was unarmed and nobody shot except them.  The Israeli army arrests Palestinian children and tortures them into signing confessions they can't read.  13 February 2014 (North Carolina protects Duke Energy from penalties for spill)  North Carolina's first response to Duke Energy's coal ash spill was to minimize it and protect the company from penalties.  13 February 2014 (EU-Israel relations depend on outcome of peace talks with Palestine)  The EU envoy to Israel says that relations will depend on the outcome of peace talks with Palestine.  Since the peace talks began, Israel has accelerated its demolitions of Palestinians' houses.  12 February 2014 (Bill in US congress would punish universities for making statements in support of a boycott of Israel)  A bill in the US congress would punish universities for making statements in support of a boycott of Israel.  It might be harder to punish them for supporting a boycott of companies and institutions that support the illegal Israeli colonies in Palestinian territory.  12 February 2014 (US and UK have fallen down in ratings for freedom of the press)  The US and UK have fallen down in ratings for freedom of the press.  It may not be enough to help us but it is a start.  12 February 2014 (UK gov't to provide "unlimited" funds for repairs)  After floods have caused tremendous damage to houses and transport in the UK, the government says it will provide "unlimited" funds for repairs.  Given their perverse austerity policies, they will take those funds out of aid for the poor. But why didn't they offer unlimited funds to prevent floods &mdash; including curbing CO2 emissions that are likely to make for worse floods in the future?  12 February 2014 (New Suit Against Tokyo Electric Power)  US Sailors Sick From Fukushima Radiation File New Suit Against Tokyo Electric Power.  12 February 2014 (Iowa farmers tell a presidential hopeful)  Iowa farmers tell a presidential hopeful that supporting big food processing companies does not mean supporting them.  12 February 2014 (Canada's government is attacking democracy on behalf of oil companies)  Canada's government is attacking democracy on behalf of oil companies.  12 February 2014 (Urgent: Support campaign for proper prosecution of rape by soldiers)  US citizens: support the campaign for proper prosecution of rape by soldiers.  12 February 2014 (Urgent: Endorse the Google shareholder resolution)  Everyone: Endorse the Google shareholder resolution aimed at Google's support for right-wing groups such as ALEC.  12 February 2014 (Google wants to detect that lots of people are taking photos or videos)  Google wants to detect that lots of people are taking photos or videos with their phones &mdash; and call the thugs.  Why should Google be allowed to know what people are doing?  12 February 2014 (Anger in Bosnia)  Anger in Bosnia, But This Time the People Can Read Their Leaders' Ethnic Lies.  12 February 2014 (Urgent: Protect people rather than mining companies)  Everyone: tell the governor of North Carolina to start protecting people rather than the mining companies that make toxic pollution.  12 February 2014 (Urgent: Make Farm Bill favor healthful food)  US citizens: call on Agriculture Secretary Vilsack to implement the Farm Bill in a way that favors healthful food.  12 February 2014 (Warm winter in Sochi)  It is so warm in Sochi that snowboarders are having trouble.  In 2054 they will need to hold the winter Olympics in a far more northerly place. By 2074, the world will have no attention or money left to hold such games.  12 February 2014 (Infiltration of undercover thugs in political groups in UK)  UK victims of undercover thug infiltrators in political groups have launched a campaign for an independent inquiry into the practice.  12 February 2014 (Seattle area sheriff wants police dept. instead of a thug dept.)  One sheriff in the Seattle area wants to run a police department instead of a gang of thugs.  12 February 2014 (UK thugs arrest student protesters to get their names)  UK thugs arrested student protesters for no reason except to get their names, then the university suspended them for protesting.  The thugs had besieged the students for hours.  12 February 2014 (How the NSA Helps the US Assassinate)  Greenwald/Scahill: How the NSA Helps the US Assassinate.  12 February 2014 (Human rights lawyer Lynne Stewart railroaded)  The railroading of human rights lawyer Lynne Stewart demonstrates the degradation of the US trial system.  You can see the effects of this in the repeated convictions of "criminals" who only went along with plans suggested by thugs and would never have been able to carry them out.  12 February 2014 (Woman attacked by thug gets threatened with 7 years in prison)  Cecily McMillan elbowed the person attacking her from behind, who turned out to be a thug, so she is threatened with 7 years in prison.  I wonder who groped her breast &mdash; was that the thug?  Thugs often attack innocent people, and make a special point of attacking people who are particularly virtuous (such as protesters for good causes). They are hardly ever prosecuted for this. If once in a while they get hit back, that's only a small step towards justice.  12 February 2014 (Indian mining company suing poor villagers)  An Indian mining company is suing poor villagers as well as destroying their forest.  12 February 2014 (Xenophobia rising around the world)  Xenophobia is rising around the world: "these are dangerous times to look foreign".  I understand the pressure to limit immigration. As millions start to flee from land that has turned into desert or ocean, this pressure will become enormous. No country is obliged to accept millions of refugees.  However, it makes a difference that our carbon emissions are responsible for the spreading deserts and oceans &mdash; and stop them. If we don't want to accept those millions of refugees we should stop destroying their land.  12 February 2014 (Spanish judge opens criminal investigation of Chinese ex-officials)  A Spanish judge has opened a criminal investigation of Chinese ex-officials for crimes against Tibetans.  I suspect that the mostly-right-wing US government is pressuring Spain's government to end this practice. Obama protects Bush and his torturers from criminal prosecution.  Time to Take a Stand to End US Impunity  12 February 2014 (Obama to imprison another whistleblower)  Obama will imprison another whistleblower, who was identified by massive surveillance of journalists' phone call records.  12 February 2014 (Charter of Digital Rights)  European Parliament candidates are asked to sign this proposed Charter of Digital Rights.  It is not strong enough on certain issues. For instance, it fails to oppose the censorship which many EU countries have already imposed, and fails to call for an end to existing mass surveillance measures such as the mandatory data retention for ISPs and phone companies.  However, I support it anyway.  12 February 2014 (Verizon is slowing Netflix traffic)  Now that US network neutrality has been eliminated, Verizon is slowing Netflix traffic.  It would be great if Verizon killed off Netflix, whose business is fundamentally unethical because of DRM. But there is little chance of that; eventually they will make a deal, with Netflix paying Verizon some money.  12 February 2014 (Aristide removed because he was unwilling to privatize)  Aristide reported in 2005 that Dubya had him removed because he was unwilling to privatize as the US demanded.  12 February 2014 (Thugs in Egypt and Sudan regularly conspire with kidnapers)  Thugs in Egypt and Sudan regularly conspire with kidnapers that torture Eritrean refugees to squeeze money out of their relatives.  To ransom hostages is cowardly; the right thing to do is to hold a funeral for them, in effect spitting in the kidnapers' faces. This takes courage, but discourage kidnapers, whereas a cowardly response keeps it going.  It is not clear how the Eritreans first fall into the hands of traffickers.  12 February 2014 (US gov't destroyed and hid photos of Osama bin Laden body)  The US government destroyed and hid photos of Osama bin Laden body in contempt of a Freedom of Information Act request.  What can you expect from these thugs? They murdered bin Laden to avoid the inconvenience of putting him on trial.  12 February 2014 (Volunteers who fought against Franco and fascism would be charged with "terrorism")  Under today's British laws, the volunteers who fought in Spain against Franco and fascism would be charged with "terrorism."  12 February 2014 (Qatar to protect construction workers from abuses)  Qatar will undertake to protect construction workers from abuses, but only on a few specific projects.  12 February 2014 (Republicans trying to amend US Constitution)  Republicans controlling state governments are trying to amend the US Constitution to require a balanced budget, which would mean making recessions worse.  11 February 2014 (Culture of 'Impunity' for US Soldiers)  Overseas, Culture of 'Impunity' for US Soldiers Guilty of Sexual Assault.  The first rule of ensuring that a foreign army can get along with local civilians is to punish any crimes by soldiers against civilians very sternly. The US may think it doesn't need to do this. The US is mistaken.  11 February 2014 (US military aid to Israel)  The enormous US military aid to Israel includes bombs and planes used to attack civilians in Gaza.  11 February 2014 (Urgent: Tell General Mills to remove GMOs from its all its cereals)  Everyone: tell General Mills to remove GMOs from all its cereals, not just from Cheerios.  11 February 2014 (Urgent: Tell World Bank to stop financing land grabs)  Everyone: demand that the World Bank stop financing land grabs in Kenya and elsewhere.  11 February 2014 (Australian supporter of boycotting Israel sued)  An Australian supporter of boycotting Israel is being sued for refusing to support a study application by an Israeli academic.  If Lynch's grounds for refusal were as stated, that the scholar was associated with a university with a campus in a colony in Palestinian territory, that was political, not racial. So I think the lawsuit is mistaken.  However, I criticize Lynch's decision to apply the boycott to an individual person. The American Studies Association, in adopting a boycott of Israeli academic institutions, emphasized that this was not aimed at Israeli scholars.  11 February 2014 (California's drought)  California's drought may be the worst in 500 years, and it is going to get worse.  11 February 2014 (Entitlements for the rich)  How Entitlements for the Rich Cheat the Rest of Us.  11 February 2014 (US Catholic school fires teacher for getting pregnant)  A Catholic school in the US fired a teacher for getting pregnant.  11 February 2014 (China helping Kenya prosecute ivory smugglers)  China has started helping Kenya prosecute ivory smugglers.  11 February 2014 (Thai gov't arrests leader of antidemocratic protest movement)  The Thai government has arrested a leader of the antidemocratic protest movement.  I can't criticize the arrest of people that represent a minority and try to sabotage elections.  11 February 2014 (Bottom trawling)  Bottom Trawling: How to Empty the Seas in Just 150 Years.  11 February 2014 (Tar sands leaks in Canada)  Tar sands leaks in Canada that were reported last May have not been stopped.  10 February 2014 (Unprecedented speed-up of the trade winds)  An unprecedented speed-up of the trade winds is driving the Earth's heat gain into the ocean instead of letting it accumulate in the atmosphere.  Aside from the point that the speed-up is cyclical, there's also the point that the reason it causes heat to go into the ocean is that the air is hotter than the ocean. Once the ocean gets sufficiently hotter, heat will start to remain in the air.  Today's extreme weather is just a foretaste of what we have already made inevitable in a few decades. The question is whether we will take steps now to prevent it from getting even worse.  10 February 2014 (We must build, build, build)  To prevent all but the rich from being squeezed out of major cities, we must build, build, build.  The obstacle is zoning that was designed to prevent the sort of density that we need in order to accommodate everyone.  10 February 2014 (Urgent: Make college tuition gratis)  US citizens: call on the government to make college tuition gratis.  (I try to avoid using the word "free" to mean "zero price" even when we're not talking about software.)  10 February 2014 (Turks protested state-imposed internet censorship)  Once again, Turks protested state-imposed internet censorship on the street.  10 February 2014 (Businesses and products that aim at middle-class customers are failing)  Across the US, businesses and products that aim at middle-class customers are failing &mdash; because those customers aren't there any more.  10 February 2014 (Responses to creationists' 22 questions)  Responses to creationists' 22 questions.  10 February 2014 (Drug maintenance)  Substitute drug maintenance problems are pretty effective at saving addicts' lives and enabling them to do useful work.  I speculate that what makes the substitute drugs safer is that they are regulated and medically administered. In other words, part of what makes the original drug so dangerous is prohibition.  10 February 2014 (No-Fly list)  The US spent 7 years covering up the fact that it had put Rahinah Ibrahim on the no-fly list by mistake.  This list is punishment without trial, and as such is a prima facie injustice.  10 February 2014 (Syngenta's own documents prove that it tried to sabotage and discredit Professor)  Syngenta's own documents prove that it tried to sabotage and discredit Professor Hayes, whose work showed that Syngenta's pesticide atrazine was dangerous.  10 February 2014 (US television has a nearly total blackout about the TPP)  US television has a nearly total blackout about the TPP.  10 February 2014 (Republicans set up fraudulent web sites)  Republicans set up fraudulent web sites pretending to represent Democratic candidates so as to divert donors' money.  This reflects the motto of the Republican Party, "By hook or by crook", as observed in voter suppression laws and distribution of false information about where to vote, as well as just plain lying about Democrats.  10 February 2014 (Urgent: Tell Whole Foods to allow workers to leave for emergencies)  Everyone: tell Whole Foods to stop firing workers because they have to leave for an emergency.  10 February 2014 (Treating global heating as news)  The time scale of global heating makes it hard to treat as news, but it could be the end of all news.  10 February 2014 (US states slowly passing laws to allow assisted suicide)  US states are slowly passing laws to allow the terminally ill to get help in suicide.  This is a step forward, but it is a shame to limit this escape route to those who are going to die soon anyway, and exclude people who can't commit suicide on their own because they are totally physically incapacitated. Some of those people face possibly decades of futile boredom, in some cases combined with horrible pain.  10 February 2014 (Mexican gangsters kidnap girls for prostitution)  Mexican gangsters roam villages and kidnap girls as young as 7 for prostitution. No one dares openly resist them; the corrupt thugs are no help.  10 February 2014 (Widespread flooding in the UK)  Widespread flooding has shown what a disaster global heating will bring to Britain.  The hard part will be to make the government confront the costs of avoiding the disaster, which get higher with delay.  10 February 2014 (Homosexuality of gays fleeing Uganda questioned)  Now that homosexuals fleeing Uganda can claim asylum because they'd face persecution there, how to decide if someone is not faking being gay?  10 February 2014 (Arrests for money laundering with bitcoin)  Why Are Bitcoiners Going to Jail for Money Laundering While Big Banks Walk?  10 February 2014 (Protesters convicted of being led by thugs to prepare molotov cocktails)  A bunch of protesters were convicted of being led by thugs to prepare molotov cocktails, but they were acquitted of "terrorism" charges.  10 February 2014 (A blow to Australia's immigration policy secrecy)  Another blow to Australia's immigration policy secrecy, which consists of "We won't tell you what we're doing" and "How dare you make accusations?"  10 February 2014 (Imprisoned in Dubai for posting a humorous video)  Shezanne Cassim was imprisoned in Dubai for posting a humorous video that didn't even criticize country's despicable government.  10 February 2014 (Depletion of groundwater around the world)  Humans are depleting groundwater around the world, just as global heating is reducing rainfall in many areas.  10 February 2014 (Urgent: Tell NHS not to sell patient data to companies)  Britons: tell the NHS not to sell patient data to companies.  10 February 2014 (Urgent: Support network neutrality)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter in favor of network neutrality.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  10 February 2014 (UK environmental research organization's dirty deal with Shell)  The UK's environmental research organization has made a dirty deal with Shell.  10 February 2014 (Protesters in Rio de Janeiro occupy main train station)  Protesters in Rio de Janeiro occupied the main train station and let everyone travel gratis.  10 February 2014 (The Australian plan to kill large sharks)  The Australian plan to kill large sharks, which migrate very far, pushes this endangered species towards extinction to save a tiny number of humans.  South Africa is concerned that this will wipe out sharks there too, since sharks swim between the two continents.  10 February 2014 (Australian Navy sailors burned boat people as punishment)  Boat people towed to Java by the Australian Navy in an Australian lifeboat say the Navy sailors burned people as punishment for asking to use a toilet.  Since the Australian government is covering up the whole activity, its denials are worthless. If it wants to convince us, it should make recordings as proof. As long as it covers up its actions we should believe all the accusations.  10 February 2014 (When a company sponsors university research on its products)  If vitamins don't address medical problems, will university researchers funded by a vitamin company tell us?  I need to point out that the same exact problem exists for the Big Pharma companies.  10 February 2014 (US Green Party says Farm Bill should be vetoed)  The US Green Party says the Farm Bill should be vetoed.  10 February 2014 (Mainstream media still try to cover up US and UK's actions in Middle East)  Mainstream media are still struggling to cover up US and UK's actions in the Middle East.  10 February 2014 (Sponsors of the Olympic games)  Sponsors of the Olympic games that refused to publicly criticize Putin's repression: Atos, Coca-Cola, Dow Chemical, General Electric, McDonald's, Omega, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble, Samsung and Visa.  10 February 2014 (Garry Kasparov on the Sochi Olympics)  Garry Kasparov says that the Sochi Olympics are all about Putin's cult of personality.  10 February 2014 (Part of the cause of lower pay for women)  Part of the cause of lower pay for women is that male senior managers are afraid of being accused of sexual harassment if they socialize or meet with women employees.  10 February 2014 (Israeli thugs attack Palestinian protest camp)  Israeli thugs attacked a Palestinian protest camp near Jericho.  10 February 2014 (Japanese women organizing sex strike)  Japanese women are organizing a sex strike against men that vote for a sexist candidate.  10 February 2014 (UK's privatization of its post office)  The UK's privatization of its post office was a giant give-away to the investors.  10 February 2014 (The way most Internet users use the net is bad)  If you are like most Internet users, the way you use the net is bad for you directly, in addition to snooping on you.  09 February 2014 (Law Must Be Free and Accessible to All)  Ralph Nader: The Law Must Be Free and Accessible to All &mdash; Not Secret and Profitable.  09 February 2014 (US is ignoring efforts towards nuclear disarmament)  The US is ignoring efforts towards nuclear disarmament.  09 February 2014 (It's no use retraining US workers to fit jobs better)  It's no use retraining US workers to fit jobs better, because the available jobs are simply far too few.  Perverse economics contribute to the lack of jobs.  09 February 2014 (Urgent: Don't allow a vote on Fast Track)  US citizens: Tell Senator Reid, don't allow a vote on Fast Track.  09 February 2014 (Urgent: Defend EPA regulation of power plant CO2 emissions)  US citizens: call on your senators to defend EPA regulation of power plant CO2 emissions.  09 February 2014 (Urgent: Get the facts right about the Keystone XL)  US citizens: sign this petition calling on Kerry to get the facts right about the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline.  Please do not access this page with Javascript enabled. I would be ashamed to have posted the link if you did that.  09 February 2014 (Favelas And Middle Classes)  Brazil's Government Has Set the Favelas And Middle Classes Against Each Other.  09 February 2014 (The Ukrainian Protesters Must Make a Decisive Break with the Far Right)  The Ukrainian Protesters Must Make a Decisive Break with the Far Right.  09 February 2014 (FBI forcing ISPs and phone companies to install metadata monitors)  The FBI is forcing ISPs and phone companies to install metadata monitors called "port readers".  09 February 2014 (Haiti deserves reparations)  Haiti deserves more than forgiveness of it dictator-imposed debt. It deserves reparations.  09 February 2014 (Palestine has been negotiating for 20 years under grave threat)  Palestine has been negotiating for 20 years under grave threat; now Israel is starting to feel the pressure of possible European boycott.  09 February 2014 (ABC spins very hard)  ABC spins very hard to pretend that stock market trends are relevant to most Americans.  08 February 2014 (Urgent: End the war on marijuana at the federal level)  US citizens: ask your congresscritter to support bills that would end the war on marijuana at the federal level.  08 February 2014 (Urgent: Call for stopping the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion)  US citizens: call for stopping the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion.  08 February 2014 (Children of the Occupation: Growing up in Palestine)  Children of the Occupation: Growing up in Palestine.  08 February 2014 (3000 civilians were killed by fighting in Afghanistan in 2013)  3000 civilians were killed by fighting in Afghanistan in 2013, mostly by the Taliban (as usual).  08 February 2014 (New video surveillance systems)  New video surveillance systems can see everyone's movements in a whole city.  Here's the ACLU's response.  What matters is not which people they do track, but which people they could track after the fact. If they can track where journalists or whistleblowers went in the past, democracy is sunk.  08 February 2014 (Paying partially disabled workers a pittance)  In the US it is legal to pay partially disabled workers a pittance, and thousands of people are exploited in this way.  08 February 2014 (Test of 900 foods in the UK)  A test of 900 foods in the UK found that over 300 were falsely labeled.  08 February 2014 (Arrested for carrying cameras on the street)  In Egypt people are arrested for carrying cameras on the street.  08 February 2014 (Assad has agreed to a truce and to allow civilians to be evacuated from Homs)  Assad has agreed to a truce and to allow civilians to be evacuated from Homs.  08 February 2014 (Privatized probation companies)  Privatized probation companies in the US jail poor people who can't pay the fees.  These companies have thousands of poor Americans jailed when they are too poor to pay the fines they owe.  08 February 2014 (Journalist who reported on use of illegal fishing method was killed by fishermen)  Cambodian journalist Suon Chan, who reported on use of illegal fishing methods, was killed by fishermen.  08 February 2014 (Campaigning for women's rights in Morocco)  Campaigning for women's rights in Morocco.  The practice in which relatives despise girls that have been raped is found in many parts of the world. In Samoa, men used (and perhaps still use) surreptitious rape to as a means to force girls to come and live with them; they knew their families would reject them for being raped. This happens because the girl's parents think of her as an asset rather than as a person.  08 February 2014 (Urgent: Call for extension of unemployment benefits)  US citizens: call for extension of unemployment benefits.  08 February 2014 (Senator Warren challenged other senators)  Senator Warren challenged other senators: does anyone believe that US enforcement of banking regulations is working?  08 February 2014 (UK plans to entrust everyone's medical records to propriety software)  The UK plans to entrust everyone's medical records to proprietary software (which is asking for trouble) made by a company with a track record for shafting the public, thanks to an inadequate concern for privacy starting from the top.  The system will also allow the state easy access to all the data. Naturally.  08 February 2014 (Urgent: Reject the Empty Oceans Act)  US citizens: call on Congress to reject the Empty Oceans Act.  08 February 2014 (Obama should appoint public interest lawyers as judges)  Now that Obama can get judges confirmed, he should appoint public interest lawyers as judges.  08 February 2014 (Ukrainian protest leader says thugs captured him and tortured him)  A Ukrainian protest leader says that thugs captured him and tortured him into making a confession that he was paid by the US.  08 February 2014 (UK thug sentenced to prison for making a false accusation)  A UK thug has been sentenced to prison for making a false accusation, saying that an important politician called him a "pleb". The politician, being a Tory, probably thought this but apparently did not say it.  While this is the right thing to do, I wonder when the UK, US, and other countries will start sentencing thugs to prison for making more serious false accusations against people who are not important politicians.  08 February 2014 (Philip Seymour Hoffman)  Philip Seymour Hoffman Is Another Victim of Extremely Stupid Drug Laws.  08 February 2014 (Campaigning against female genital mutilation)  Teenage girls in Britain are campaigning against female genital mutilation.  They know that girls in their communities are at risk.  08 February 2014 (Journalist held and interrogated)  Kuwaiti-American journalist Ahmed Shihab-Eldin is held and interrogated for hours every time he returns to the US.  07 February 2014 (Turkey's new internet law)  Turkey's new internet law allows the state to block a web site by administrative decree, and requires ISPs to record people's contacts.  Several European countries also block web sites by decree, and the US government "seizes" domain names by decree. India has the power to take down a web site by decree. These practices are unjust in any country.  The tracking of web visits also exists in Europe and to some extent in the US.  07 February 2014 (Urgent: Establish a public health care option)  Citizens of Massachusetts: sign this petition for establishing a public health care option.  07 February 2014 (Australian gov't fabricating excuse to end program to promote renewable energy)  The Australian government, which will do anything to boost the fossil fuel industry, is now fabricating an excuse to end the program to promote renewable energy.  07 February 2014 (The world's marine reserves)  More than half of the world's marine reserves are inadequately protected and fail to encourage wildlife.  07 February 2014 (DEA's guide for how to disguise use of secret snooping data)  The DEA's guide for how to disguise use of secret snooping data has been published.  07 February 2014 (Chaos Computer Club has filed a criminal complaint)  The Chaos Computer Club has filed a criminal complaint accusing the German government and other governments of illegal surveillance.  07 February 2014 (Five predictions made by Karl Marx)  Five predictions made by Karl Marx that fit today's extreme form of capitalism.  07 February 2014 (Lured to paying millions in subsidy for big sports events)  Cities and states are lured to paying millions in subsidy for big sports events based on wildly exaggerated estimates of how much the local economy will gain from the events.  This article refers to the Superbowl, but it's the same for the Olympics or the World Cup.  I would tell the boosters of these games to seek private investment if they are so profitable.  07 February 2014 (Qatar Airways subjects flight attendants to a regime almost like prison)  Qatar Airways subjects flight attendants to a regime almost like prison, firing them for the slightest infraction of absurd rules.  Qatar is one of the countries I would never visit. The required iris scan is just one of the reasons. I won't even change planes in the U.A.E.  Nobody should ever work in a country that demands exit visas.  07 February 2014 (Kim Dotcom's lawsuit)  New Zealand's digital snooping agency says it failed to preserve the data for Kim Dotcom's lawsuit alleging illegal snooping.  07 February 2014 (UK agents ran DDOS campaigns against Anonymous)  UK agents ran DDOS campaigns against Anonymous, interfering with their chat sites and with all the other sites co-hosted with them.  I reject the term "DDOS attack". When activists do it, it is a form of online protest; I won't call it an "attack" when someone else does it. What happened here is that the state sent a crowd of state agents to protest at a people's houses and the pubs where they meet.  06 February 2014 (Urgent: Fix the Voting Rights Act)  US citizens: support fixing the Voting Rights Act.  06 February 2014 (Urgent: Support the Government By The People Act)  US citizens: Support the Government By The People Act.  06 February 2014 (Egyptian journalist tortured by thugs)  Egyptian journalist Hossam al-Meneai was tortured by thugs, says the American journalist who was arrested with him.  06 February 2014 (Japan's secrecy law)  Americans need to be concerned about Japan's secrecy law.  06 February 2014 (2013 was second-hottest recorded non-el-Ni&nacute;o year)  2013 was the second-hottest non-el-Ni&nacute;o year since records began.  06 February 2014 (Iraq gov't imprisons, tortures, and executes women, without trial)  Iraq's US-installed government imprisons women without trial, tortures them into confessing (or threatens to rape their daughters), then executes them. All this to punish their male relatives.  06 February 2014 (French protection for organizers of the Rwandan massacres)  French protection for organizers of the Rwandan massacres may be exposed in court.  06 February 2014 (Why the NSA spied on German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder)  The NSA spied on German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder because he refused to help Dubya conquer Iraq.  06 February 2014 (Evidence that Sri Lankan soldiers and thugs covered up murders)  Evidence that Sri Lankan soldiers and thugs destroyed graves to cover up murders, under orders from the high command.  There is evidence also against the LTTE, which is no surprise. But those responsible are dead.  06 February 2014 (The US Farm Bill)  What's good and what's bad in the US Farm Bill.  06 February 2014 (Evidence that Three Mile Island meltdown made people sick in Pennsylvania)  Evidence that the Three Mile Island meltdown made lots of people sick in Pennsylvania, and killed animals.  06 February 2014 (Israel authorizes additional colonies in Palestinian territory)  Israel continues making a mockery of peace talks by authorizing additional construction of colonies in Palestinian territory.  06 February 2014 (European Parliament strengthens energy targets)  The European Parliament strengthened the weak energy targets that the European Commission had proposed.  06 February 2014 (Congress and Obama making America's children go hungry)  Congress and Obama, with the cuts in food stamps, are making America's children go hungry.  Republicans aim to force US women to have more children and prevent them from feeding these children.  06 February 2014 (Water being used up by oil and gas drilling in the US)  Oil and gas drilling in the US are using up lots of water in the driest areas.  06 February 2014 (Laws against homosexuality)  Although Russia has banned saying "It's not bad to be gay", its law is does not go as far as some other countries' laws against homosexuality.  06 February 2014 (Land of "opportunity")  Obama harps on "opportunity" to distract from high US inequality, but the US poor haven't got much opportunity either.  06 February 2014 (CVS to stop selling tobacco)  CVS has decided to stop selling tobacco.  I don't advocate banning tobacco, because prohibiting addictive drugs does great social harm. However, it should not be sold in pharmacies because selling it there gives tobacco a sort of medical endorsement.  06 February 2014 (US temporarily ceases drone attacks in Pakistan)  The US has temporarily ceased drone attacks in Pakistan to try to encourage peace talks.  06 February 2014 (UK's floods partly due to extractive agriculture)  Extractive agriculture is part of the cause of the UK's floods.  06 February 2014 (Russia arresting people who monitor environmental damage from Olympic games)  Russia is arresting people who monitor environmental damage from the Olympic games, using bizarre and meaningless pretexts.  05 February 2014 (The use of chemical weapons in Syria)  Some US claims about the use of chemical weapons in Syria can't be true.  05 February 2014 (Syria destabilized by effects of global heating and by Dubya's occupation of Iraq)  Chomsky reports on how Syria was destabilized by effects of global heating and by the consequences of Dubya's occupation of Iraq.  This does not in any way excuse Assad for his tyranny and crimes. It also does not excuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia for funding and encouraging an armed rebellion in Syria when peaceful protests were going strong.  The recent report about execution of prisoners by Assad's men was paid for by Qatar.  That doesn't mean the it isn't true, but Qatar should not succeed in hiding its atrocities behind Assad's atrocities.  05 February 2014 (Bans on shark fins)  The NOAA has retreated from trying to abolish state bans on shark fins.  05 February 2014 (Facebook's mobile app snoops on SMS messages)  Facebook's mobile app snoops on SMS messages.  05 February 2014 (Indian thugs attacked a demonstration by Christian Dalits)  Indian thugs attacked a demonstration by Christian Dalits outside the parliament.  05 February 2014 (Workers without health care)  Republicans want to make it easier for employers to leave workers without health care: just give them only 39 hours a week of work.  05 February 2014 (Republicans keep trying to hurt the unemployed)  Since the US deficit has gone down greatly, why do Republicans keep trying to hurt the unemployed?  Because the misguided goal of cutting the deficit was always just an excuse to take from the non-rich.  05 February 2014 (Republicans purse only non-rich drug users)  The Republicans will pursue their War on Drug Users to the end, but only against non-rich drug users.  05 February 2014 (NAFTA and the TPP)  NAFTA hurt family farms in Mexico, the US and Canada, at the expense of agribusiness. The TPP threatens to do the same in many more countries.  05 February 2014 (Tar sands oil companies' toxic pollution)  Researchers say that tar sands oil companies have greatly underestimated the amount of toxic pollution they produce.  05 February 2014 (To build Olympic games venue, Russia destroyed forests and wetlands)  To build the Olympic games venue, Russia destroyed forests and wetlands and "replaced" them with ecologically worthless artificial substitutes.  05 February 2014 (Is Freeing a Duck "Terrorism"?)  Is Freeing a Duck "Terrorism"?  I only partly agree with the idea of animal rights, but I do support human rights, and labeling animal rights activism as "terrorism" clearly violates them. I don't have to agree with them to support their right to campaign for their views.  05 February 2014 (FISA orders and national security letters)  Google, Facebook and other companies have released statistics showing at most 100,000 users have been subject to FISA orders and national security letters.  That's a small fraction of the users &mdash; but if they include journalists, whistleblowers and dissidents, democracy is in danger.  What matters is not how many people's data the state  has looked at  but how many people's data the state could look at when it wishes.  05 February 2014 (Urgent: Stop South Dakota from taking children from relatives)  US citizens: call on Obama to stop South Dakota from taking Lakota children away from their relatives on trivial excuses.  I think the word "kidnapping" used in the petition is incorrect, but I signed anyway because I think the substance is valid.  05 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose bills intended to attack wildlife and wetlands)  US citizens: urge your congresscritter to oppose several bills intended to attack wildlife and wetlands.  05 February 2014 (Urgent: Extend the Production Tax Credit for renewable energy)  US citizens: call on your senators to extend the Production Tax Credit for renewable energy.  05 February 2014 (International Olympic Committee supports Russian repression)  With the International Olympic Committee supporting Russian repression, the Olympic Spirit means repression.  This is not surprising given that the Olympic Games have for many years brought repression to every place they have been held.  05 February 2014 (Bounties for murder of political candidates in Colombia)  Colombia's principal terrorist group, the state-linked paramilitaries, have announced bounties for the murder of political candidates.  05 February 2014 (Karzai has been holding peace talks with Taliban for months)  Karzai has been holding peace talks with the Taliban for months.  I wish these talks had made progress. Given that the Afghan government lacks the support necessary to defeat the Taliban, and that it increasingly spits on women's rights, I don't think trying to "win the war" makes any sense.  Pakistan is also trying to talk with the Taliban.  05 February 2014 (Antidemocratic Party in Thailand sues to invalidate elections)  The Antidemocratic Party in Thailand has sued to invalidate the elections on the grounds that the actions of the Antidemocratic Party interfered with voting.  05 February 2014 (Foreign journalists escape from Egypt)  Several foreign journalists succeeded in escaping from Egypt before they could be captured by the forces of state repression.  The coup has taken Egypt from a danger of repression to blatant repression.  05 February 2014 (Laws needed to help reduce cancer rates)  With cancer rates increasing world-wide due to tobacco, alcohol and obesity, cancer treatment is not enough &mdash; laws are needed to make it easier to avoid those dangers.  05 February 2014 (Drought in southwestern US)  Superstitious Nevada farmers are holding prayer sessions asking for an end to the drought in the southwestern US.  They ought to be holding Keystone XL protests instead: that would at least have a chance to reduce the future droughts that are expected to be much worse.  05 February 2014 (Opting out from tracking by commercial data brokers)  One writer tried to "opt out" from tracking by commercial data brokers and found that the possibility of doing so is rather spotty.  I have opted out from these data brokers by paying cash.  05 February 2014 (NPR's whitewash of toxic sewage sludge)  NPR published a whitewash of toxic sewage sludge.  04 February 2014 (Hiring collusion between big tech companies)  The hiring collusion between big tech companies shows that their adoration of the "free market" is just a story they tell to fool the gullible.  A competitive market is a kind of social system. For certain purposes, is a good solution. Keeping it competitive depends on state regulation.  04 February 2014 (West Virginia toxic spill not over yet)  The West Virginia toxic spill isn't over yet. Moreover, it's just part of a permanent toxic spill that usually goes unnoticed in the media.  04 February 2014 (Mexico's supposed crackdown on pimps)  Mexico's supposed crackdown on pimps that force women into prostitution has got off to a weak start.  04 February 2014 (How web sites correlate information about visitors with names)  Clever tricks that web sites use to collect information about visitors and correlate those with names.  How these companies currently use the data they collect is not significant because (1) they could change those policies tomorrow and (2) those policies don't apply when government agencies such as the NSA collect the data.  04 February 2014 (Uganda bans miniskirts)  Uganda's first step to impose control on women is to ban miniskirts, not to mention bikinis, and any pictures of them, and any writing about them.  I think even the song "Itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny yellow polkadot bikini" will be criminalized by this law, not to mention lots of movies that could get a G rating in the US.  04 February 2014 (Facebook)  One user writes that Facebook led her to be in love with "the projection of [her] own desired life".  Cutting down on the amount of her usage by Facebook may have addressed this problem, but not all the others.  04 February 2014 (People in Rio de Janeiro mock surreal prices)  People in Rio de Janeiro are mocking the surreal prices provoked by the coming World Cup.  03 February 2014 (Dioxin contamination in seafood caught in Galveston Bay, Texas)  Seafood caught in Galveston Bay, Texas, is contaminated with dioxin.  03 February 2014 (Prince drops lawsuit against fans for distributing recordings)  Prince, who briefly thought of changing his name to Jerk, has dropped a lawsuit against his fans for distributing "bootleg" recordings.  I see nothing wrong with that practice.  03 February 2014 (The cost of the "US War on Drugs")  The US "War on Drugs" has cost a trillion dollars in South America, and resulted in over 100,000 killed.  03 February 2014 (Toxic substances in clothing)  Clothing, even for children, often contains toxic substances.  03 February 2014 (Japan wants to sell India some potential meltdowns)  Japan wants to sell India some potential meltdowns.  03 February 2014 (Pentagon spends millions on directing Hollywood)  The Pentagon spends millions on directing Hollywood to make pro-military propaganda and convince Americans to support military adventures.  03 February 2014 (Obama's "MyRA" retirement accounts)  Obama's "MyRA" retirement accounts won't do much good for the Americans who might try to use them.  03 February 2014 (Ten arguments against prohibition of prostitution)  Ten arguments against prohibition of prostitution.  03 February 2014 (Christians try to shut down art that makes fun of their religion)  It's not just Muslims that try to shut down art that makes fun of their religion. In Australia, Christians are trying.  03 February 2014 (Japanese whalers' violent tactics)  Sea Shepherd described Japanese whalers' violent tactics.  03 February 2014 (TSA knew X-ray scanners were useless and dangerous)  The Theater of Security Agency and all its staff knew in advance that X-ray scanners were useless and dangerous. The TSA delayed and endangered passengers with those machines solely to give the impression it was Doing Something.  The article also says that power-tripping TSA agents impose extra searches and delays as a form of harassment, while dishonestly claiming it is a "random search".  03 February 2014 (Obama fails to recognize that he could end marijuana prohibition)  Obama says he thinks prohibition of marijuana is unfortunate but fails to recognize that he could end that prohibition any day.  03 February 2014 (Letting stores have too much information about the purchaser)  Staples and many other stores offer different prices to different customers and don't admit that they are doing so.  This is a consequence of letting them have too much information about the purchaser. When I buy something, the store doesn't know who I am, because I pay cash.  03 February 2014 (Straight White Male)  In gaming terms, Straight White Male is the lowest "difficulty setting" for real life.  03 February 2014 (Tens of thousands of people blocked from voting in Thai election)  The anti-government movement in Thailand, a substantial minority with some powerful backing, has blocked tens of thousands of people from voting in the election.  We have to consider them the anti-democracy movement.  03 February 2014 (Presidential election in Afghanistan)  Afghanistan is trying to have a democratic election for president.  03 February 2014 (Canada keeping business rights treaty secret)  Canada is negotiating a business rights treaty with the EU, and says it has to be kept secret in order to negotiate it, even the parts that are supposedly finished.  03 February 2014 (Pakistan's secret record of casualties of US drone attacks)  Leaked: Pakistan's secret record of the casualties of US drone attacks. In 2009, it abruptly stops treating which casualties are civilians.  03 February 2014 (The pseudoscience told to US Senate about global heating)  Refuting the pseudoscience that the US Senate was told about global heating.  03 February 2014 (George Lakoff's advice on framing)  George Lakoff's advice on framing is vital for progressives.  It's also vital for the free software movement. We reject the weak compromises advocated under the term "open source"; we take a clear moral stand.  03 February 2014 (Australian gov't uses its lifeboats to move boat people to Indonesia)  The Australian government is secretly transferring boat people onto its own lifeboats and towing those boats to Indonesia.  03 February 2014 ("Free trade" increases inequality in developed world)  Studies confirm that "free trade" is the main cause of increased inequality in the developed world.  03 February 2014 (Many companies only say they support curbing global heating)  Many companies say they support action to curb global heating, then contribute to groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce that try to prevent it.  03 February 2014 (Obama still supports Clapper after admitting he lied to Congress)  Obama still supports Clapper even after admitting (euphemistically) that Clapper lied to Congress.  Obama was never much of a supporter of human rights.  03 February 2014 (Canada's WiFi tracking scheme)  More about Canada's WiFi tracking scheme, which seems to have been a dry run for the NSA.  03 February 2014 (China kicks out foreign journalists in retaliation for criticism)  China struggles to pretend it is not kicking out foreign journalists in retaliation for criticism in the press.  The US is not spotless on this issue either: it requires journalists to apply for a special visa, even if they come from countries whose citizens normally don't require a visa.  03 February 2014 (Gates Foundation and US gov't want to track all students)  The Gates Foundation and the US government want to track all students from preschool to workforce.  03 February 2014 (Utah public school makes students pay for lunches)  Utah School Threw Out Students' Lunches Because They Were In Debt.  It is disgusting for public schools to make students pay for lunch, or for anything.  03 February 2014 (UK wants to secretly subpoena journalists' notes)  The UK wants to secretly subpoena journalists' notes.  03 February 2014 (US State Dept. adopts bogus evaluation of planet-roaster pipeline)  The US State Department adopted another bogus evaluation of the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline.  02 February 2014 (Flooding in the UK)  Global heating was expected to bring flooding to the UK in 2030, but it is hitting already.  02 February 2014 (US to pressure Sri Lanka to investigate war crimes committed against Tamil civilians)  The US is going to pressure Sri Lanka to investigate war crimes committed against Tamil civilians.  This is the right thing to do, but when will the US investigate the war crimes committed by Dubya in Iraq?  02 February 2014 (Drop the "all of the above" energy policy)  If Obama wants to save our climate, he must drop the "all of the above" energy policy.  02 February 2014 (Urgent: Raise the minimum wage)  US citizens: call on Congress to raise the minimum wage.  I've promoted similar campaigns before, and it is good to keep showing Congress pressure to do this.  02 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose the cuts in food stamps)  Citizens of California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin: call on your senators to oppose the cuts in food stamps, which will fall mainly on those states.  02 February 2014 (Surveillance in the US today exceeds Orwell's worst nightmare)  Surveillance in the US today exceeds Orwell's worst nightmare.  This level of surveillance is incompatible with democracy.  02 February 2014 (7 big omissions in the State Department's whitewash of Keystone XL)  7 big omissions in the State Department's whitewash of Keystone XL.  02 February 2014 (Global heating is helping fungus kill the Douglas fir trees of the Pacific Northwest)  Global heating is helping fungus kill the Douglas fir trees of the Pacific Northwest.  02 February 2014 (Obama Turns to Big Business)  Record-Breaking Long-Term Unemployment in Virtually Every State, and Obama Turns to Big Business?  02 February 2014 (The Indian ID card)  The Indian ID card is the world's biggest biometric scheme, and the state has tried to impose it on everyone.  02 February 2014 (Media Suffer Winter Chill in Coverage of Sochi Olympics)  Media Suffer Winter Chill in Coverage of Sochi Olympics.  02 February 2014 (Bayer CEO says)  Bayer CEO says, "We did not develop this medicine (Nexavar) for Indians, We developed it for Western patients who can afford it."  02 February 2014 (Heed the Warnings in Extreme Weather &mdash; Or Risk Losing Earth)  Heed the Warnings in Extreme Weather &mdash; Or Risk Losing Earth.  02 February 2014 (Vehicle-To-Vehicle communication systems for cars)  Proposed vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems for cars could turn out to be a way to track them.  It's possible to design such a system so that it provides the same benefits and can't be used for tracking. All it requires is political will.  02 February 2014 (The More We Learn about Nuclear Past, the More an 'Accident' Seems Likely)  The More We Learn about Nuclear Past, the More an 'Accident' Seems Likely.  02 February 2014 (The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan)  Most Americans consider the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan failures.  The conquest and occupation of Iraq were much worse than a failure &mdash; the right term is "crime against humanity". Bush deserves to be prosecuted for it.  But was it a failure? In terms of its stated purpose, eliminating Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, it was a success before the start &mdash; since he didn't have any.  02 February 2014 (Mobile surveillance robots for shopping malls)  New product: mobile surveillance robots for shopping malls.  I do feel irritated when I get checked by "security", usually at airports. I hope you do, too. If this robot keeps permanent records, which I expect it will, it will be like a mobile surveillance camera installation.  02 February 2014 (Toxic spills in coal country)  In coal country, toxic spills happen continually and people are disposable. It has been that way for over a century, as companies find excuses to block or ignore regulations against pollution.  02 February 2014 (Secret EU plan to put remote control devices in all cars)  The EU has a secret plan to put devices in all cars to allow them to be stopped remotely.  This would be used by the state against criminals and protesters, but experience shows that others will find out how to use it too.  02 February 2014 (Islamist terror growing in Egypt)  Islamist terror is growing in Egypt.  02 February 2014 (The White Maleness of Geek Culture)  Forget Iron Man-Child &mdash; Let's Fight the White Maleness of Geek Culture.  02 February 2014 (The Spanish government's plan to nearly ban abortion has roused big opposition)  The Spanish government's plan to nearly ban abortion has roused big opposition.  02 February 2014 (Canada's spy agency snoops on WiFi users in airports)  Canada's spy agency snoops on WiFi users in airports, then follows them through other connections. We don't know how it does this.  02 February 2014 (Very Urgent: Do not to approve the Keystone XL)  US citizens: call on Obama not to approve the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline.  02 February 2014 (Urgent: Oppose "fast track" for the TPP)  US citizens: call on Minority Leader Pelosi to oppose "fast track" for the TPP.  02 February 2014 (Clapper thinks Japan's state secrecy law is a great thing)  Clapper thinks Japan's state secrecy law, which impedes access to information about the handling and status of the Fukushima meltdowns, is a great thing.  01 February 2014 (Assad's army has demolished entire neighborhoods)  Assad's army has demolished entire neighborhoods whose inhabitants were thought to favor the rebels.  01 February 2014 (For-profit colleges in the US prey on people)  For-profit colleges in the US prey on people desperate for a way to escape poverty using exaggerated claims and high-pressure sales.  Federal student loans should not be available for these schools. However, the underlying problem is that of the plutocratic policies that favor the rich and have driven 1/3 of the middle class down and out.  01 February 2014 (The death penalty in the US)  The evolution of the death penalty in the US responds to a philosophical conflict.  01 February 2014 (UK gov't rationing access to health care through the NHS)  The skinflint UK government is rationing access to health care through the NHS.  That dumps Britons into a US-like situation where the wealthy can pay for their own care while the rest are screwed.  01 February 2014 (The Great Barrier Reef faces death by a thousand cuts)  The Great Barrier Reef faces death by a thousand cuts.  01 February 2014 (Moving money to public banks)  As some cities consider removing their money from the big fraudster banks, they need another place to put that money, such as public banks.  01 February 2014 (Some penguin species are threatened by the effects of global heating)  Some penguin species are threatened by the effects of global heating.  01 February 2014 (Urgent: End the NFL's tax exemption)  US citizens: call on Congress to end the NFL's tax exemption.  01 February 2014 (Urgent: Permanently cancel plans to drill for oil in Alaskan Arctic waters)  US citizens: call on Obama to permanently cancel plans to drill for oil in Alaskan Arctic waters.  01 February 2014 (India passed a law to end manual scavenging of human wastes)  India passed a law to end manual scavenging of human wastes, but isn't implementing it very energetically.  Simply dictating "no more manual scavenging of human wastes" won't change anything in places where the systems require manual scavenging. What's needed is a program to build sewer systems and toilets connected to them. That will take money and time.  01 February 2014 (Communities in California are about to run out of water)  17 rural communities in California are about to run out of water. They contain at least 11,000 people.  The drought extends across most of the state, but it is only a foretaste of what global heating will bring.  01 February 2014 (The only independent TV channel may be pushed off the air in Russia)  The only independent TV channel may be pushed off the air for asking a question about Russia's strategy during World War II.  Whatever you think about the question, the response seems suspiciously extreme.  01 February 2014 (Very urgent: Join protest vigil against Keystone XL pipeline on Monday)  In the US: join a protest vigil against the Keystone XL pipeline on Feb 3.  01 February 2014 (Armed, masked Israelis attack Palestinian farmers)  Armed, masked Israelis attacked some Palestinian farmers; Israeli troops came and molested the Palestinians further.  01 February 2014 (Netanyahu's proposal to give Palestine some sovereignty)  Netanyahu's proposal to give Palestine sovereignty over some Israeli settlements was meant to provoke Palestinian rejection, but some Israelis rejected it first.  01 February 2014 (More comments on situation in Ukraine)  More comments on the situation in Ukraine.  01 February 2014 (Farmageddon)  A review of Farmageddon: The True Cost of Cheap Meat.  The article dares to raise the question of how many children we should have. Having no children is an important way to contribute to civilization's survival. It also frees you to do something that matters with your life, even if you're not rich.  01 February 2014 (New study shows neonicotinoid pesticide endangers bumblebees)  A new study shows that a neonicotinoid pesticide damages bumblebees' ability to collect pollen for their young.  Bumblebees are important pollinators; endangering them is playing with fire. The doubts that are raised in the article might affect the level of damage that normally occurs, but not the fact that it happens.  01 February 2014 (The axolotl seems to be extinct in the wild)  The axolotl seems to be extinct in the wild.  01 February 2014 (UK gov't backs down from prosecuting man who tried to 'steal' food from garbage bin)  Public pressure made the UK government back down from prosecuting the men who tried to 'steal' food from a supermarket's garbage bin.  01 February 2014 (Persecution of gays in Nigeria)  Persecution of gays in Nigeria ranges from betrayal to trial to lynching.  01 February 2014 (Egypt to charge 20 journalists with ludicrous charges)  Egypt plans to charge 20 al-Jazeera journalists with ludicrous charges ranging from belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood to "harming the national interest" and illicit possession of broadcast equipment.  This is Putinesque contempt for freedom of the press.  Some of these journalists are being kept in brainwashing conditions similar to those Bradley Manning suffered.  This also reminds me of the Yemeni journalist imprisoned at Obama's request for interviewing terrorists.  01 February 2014 (China installing solar generating capacity at an amazing pace)  China is installing solar generating capacity at an amazing pace, but coal generating capacity 3 times as fast.  This is not progress, merely regress a little slower than it might have been. Progress will be when the amount of coal-based generation goes down.  01 February 2014 (Selling shark fins)  The US government is advancing a regulation about sharks that would overturn state and local bans on selling shark fins.  01 February 2014 (Britain Will Have to Adapt to Climate Change &mdash; And Fast)  Flooding Experts Say Britain Will Have to Adapt to Climate Change &mdash; And Fast.  This is the result of failing to curb global heating a decade ago. With the fossil policies of today's fossil governments, it will be a lot worse in 30 years.  01 February 2014 (NSA spied on other countries' participation in 2009 Copenhagen climate conference)  The NSA spied on other countries' participation in the 2009 Copenhagen climate conference.  This was when the attempt to reach a global agreement to reduce CO2 emissions and avert disaster failed spectacularly because many governments were unwilling to agree on a real solution. The US was unwilling, and this NSA surveillance surely helped the US government achieve its aim of "no deal, burn away!"  01 February 2014 (Clapper told Congress that al-Nusra would like to attack the US)  Clapper told Congress that al-Nusra, one of the Syrian factions that labels itself as "al-Qa'ida", would like to attack the US.  Clapper has lied to Congress before with impunity; I would not put it past him to lie about this too. Whether this is true or not, his am is surely to convince us that massive general surveillance is necessary.  If he is not lying, perhaps he is exaggerating. Perhaps some member of al-Nusra said to others, "Wouldn't it be great to attack Americas some day?" and others said, "Sure, after we kill all the Syrian Shi'ites and Christians, let's kill Americans next."  An interesting point is that al-Nusra is part of the group of Syrian factions that the US may support because it is fighting against ISIS.  Syria is a fight involving at least three sides that are murderous and evil. If any one of them were the only one, we could envision intervening against that side if the Syrian people wanted us to. Those who want an intervention against one side can easily cite valid reasons for it.  But it is not feasible to intervene against all the evil sides; and if we were to intervene against only some of them, in effect we would be supporting the others.  I don't see any military way to make things better in Syria; at least let's avoid making them worse.  01 February 2014 ("School choice" proves to give no academic benefit)  Now that "school choice" proves to give no academic benefit, the advocates of this indirect scheme of privatization hunt for bizarre excuses.  01 February 2014 (Thugs' investigations can't be trusted)  How many other UK convictions of protesters and others are invalid because of dishonesty by the thugs? Their own investigations can't be trusted.  01 February 2014 (Urgent: Sign this petition for network neutrality)  US and EU citizens: sign this petition for network neutrality.  01 February 2014 (Urgent: Stop pushing the TPP)  US citizens: tell Obama to stop pushing the TPP.  31 January 2014 (Right-wing "marriage promotion" programs)  Right-wing "marriage promotion" programs are an excuse for shafting the poor, and do nothing to reduce the obstacle that make poor people's marriages fail: poverty itself.  The article also shows that ease of access to divorce has nothing to do with successful marriages.  As for Ross Douthat's idea of trying to force women to have babies so that they might feel it necessary to get married, it's not only a nonsequitur, it is perverse. We need fewer babies to be born.  31 January 2014 (Pollution of Gaza's aquifer)  Israel is blocking Gaza's wastewater plant from operating, which is causing further pollution of Gaza's aquifer.  I guess the plan is to make Gazans get sick and die.  31 January 2014 (B'liar has endorsed the Egyptian military government)  Tony B'liar has endorsed the Egyptian military government.  It's true that Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood trampled Egyptians' human rights. That's what Islamists stand for. However, the coup government has gone much further in this harm.  31 January 2014 (Shell abandoned plans to drill for oil in Alaskan Arctic this year)  Shell abandoned plans to drill for oil in the Alaskan Arctic this year.  That delays the damage but we need to block it entirely.  31 January 2014 (Scarlett Johansson chose to promote SodaStream rather than Oxfam)  Unable to do both, Scarlett Johansson chose to promote SodaStream rather than Oxfam.  I guess SodaStream pays more.  30 January 2014 (Activist Vera Scroggins)  Activist Vera Scroggins has been banned from going to the local hospital, the local supermarket and the local Chinese restaurant by an extremely broad anti-protest injunction for a fracker.  Merely to ban someone from really protesting is injust in itself.  30 January 2014 (Roundup responsible for the great decline in Monarch butterflies)  Roundup is responsible for the great decline in Monarch butterflies.  30 January 2014 (Fanmi Lavalas activists face criminal charges)  Fanmi Lavalas activists face criminal charges, which seem to have been fabricated.  30 January 2014 (Pakistan's Prime Minister wants negotiation with the Taliban)  Pakistan's Prime Minister wants negotiation with the Taliban.  30 January 2014 (Urgent: condemn the House's foodstamp cuts and call on the Senate to undo them)  US citizens: condemn the House's foodstamp cuts and call on the Senate to undo them.  30 January 2014 (Justin Bieber is Lucky That He's Rich)  Justin Bieber is Lucky That He's Rich. Poor Immigrants Don't Get Off so Lightly.  If Bieber was driving drunk, that charge should not be dropped. Drunk drivers risk killing someone, and stars are no exception. On the other hand, people shouldn't be deported for minor things.  30 January 2014 (Does Obama Administration View Journalists as Snowden's "Accomplices"?)  Does Obama Administration View Journalists as Snowden's "Accomplices"? It Seems So.  30 January 2014 (Urgent: Ban pharmacists from making up drugs for executions)  US citizens: Call on the American Pharmaceutical Association to ban pharmacists from making up drugs for executions.  30 January 2014 (Showering in Formaldehyde? Fresh Fears in West Virginia)  Showering in Formaldehyde? Fresh Fears in West Virginia.  30 January 2014 (Urgent: Call on Wilmar to stop causing deforestation)  Everyone: call on Wilmar to carry out its promises to stop causing deforestation.  30 January 2014 (Schools where US taxpayers fund teaching of anti-science)  Schools where US taxpayers fund teaching of anti-science.  30 January 2014 (Obama's efforts aimed at ending imprisonment without trial)  Obama's efforts aimed at ending imprisonment without trial are so slow and narrow that we can conclude they are programmed not to do the job.  30 January 2014 (Urgent: Ban the pesticide sulfoxaflor)  US citizens: call on the EPA to ban the pesticide sulfoxaflor, which is known to hurt bees.  30 January 2014 (Israeli troops attacked a peaceful protest in the Jordan Valley)  Israeli troops attacked a peaceful protest in the Jordan Valley. The authorities arrested two activists, handcuffed them, kicked them in the ribs, blindfolded them, lodged false charges against them, and did not let them contact lawyers.  30 January 2014 (The environmental damage that frackers will do)  Frackers should have to pay a lot of money to cover the environmental damage they will do.  30 January 2014 (10 Things The West Needs To Know About The Situation In Kiev)  A Ukrainian Explains 10 Things The West Needs To Know About The Situation In Kiev.  30 January 2014 (Progress of Port-au-Prince reconstruction)  The rich in Haiti say that Port-au-Prince is being rebuilt, but the poor don't see much improvement since the earthquake.  30 January 2014 (Greek Coast Guard accused of sinking migrant boat)  Boat people accuse the Greek Coast Guard of causing their boat to sink and then kicking people who tried to cling to the Coast Guard ship.  If these charges are false, why didn't the Coast Guard make a video to document the truth?  The migrants share the responsibility for the death of the children, having brought them on such a dangerous trip, but that doesn't excuse the Coast Guard for killing them.  This doesn't mean that migrants are entitled to go to Greece just because they would like to. I understand that they had to flee Afghanistan and Syria, but they could stay in Turkey (which is where they were coming from).  30 January 2014 (Pakistan imposes state of emergency)  Pakistan has imposed a state of emergency, including secret courts and allowing thugs to freely shoot to kill, supposedly as part of a plan to suppress the Taliban.  30 January 2014 (Much of GCHQ's spying is illegal, warns British lawyer)  A British lawyer told members of Parliament that much of GCHQ's spying is illegal.  30 January 2014 (Karzai accuses US of carrying out false-flag suicide bombings)  Karzai accuses the US of carrying out false-flag suicide bombings in Afghanistan.  I don't think it is true in this case, but the US has done things like this before.  30 January 2014 (Many species of fish becoming smaller)  Global heating may be responsible for making many species of fish smaller, up to 1/3 smaller than 38 years ago.  Intense fishing may be responsible, because there is usually a size limit on allowable catch; that selects for fish that become mature with a smaller size.  30 January 2014 (Urgent: Extension of unemployment benefits)  US citizens: phone your senators to support extension of unemployment benefits.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  30 January 2014 (Urgent: End prohibition of marijuana)  US citizens: call on your congresscritter to end prohibition of marijuana.  30 January 2014 (What SF techies could do to stop resentment)  Some obvious ideas for what San Francisco techies could do to help convince the rest of the city's residents not to resent them.  However, there is no substitute for building a lot more living space in San Francisco.  30 January 2014 (US states trying experimental combinations of drugs for executions)  US states can't get drugs to execute people with, so they are trying experimental combinations with unpredictable results.  I think the means of execution is a secondary issue &mdash; the death penalty is wrong regardless of how it is done.  30 January 2014 (US prison illegally harassing prisoner John Kiriakou)  US prison is illegally harassing prisoner John Kiriakou, for instance by reading the letters he sends, and reading mail from his lawyer, and claiming he is forbidden to write to the media.  30 January 2014 (Logging into sites through Facebook)  When users log in to a site through Facebook, Facebook gives the site access to lots of information about the user.  If this is what a site demands from you, you should not touch it anyway!  30 January 2014 (Australian protesters try to block clearance of forest)  Australian protesters are trying to block the clearance of a forest which is needed to launch a coal mine.  Both the means and the end endanger civilization's survival.  30 January 2014 (Using Google Maps from a smartphone gives data to the NSA)  If you use Google Maps from a smartphone, you're giving data to the NSA.  To some extent this is because Google designed it to track you. This includes the fact that it asks you which address you're interested in. I used to use Google Maps, back when it worked without running nonfree Javascript code, but I never entered an address; instead I scrolled around in the area I was interested in and found the address for myself.  I've pointed out for years that the system could do the same job while respecting privacy more by searching the map data in your own computer for the addresses you're interested in.  30 January 2014 (ALEC claims it does not track bills despite proof otherwise)  ALEC claims it does not track the progress of bills that follow its proposals, notwithstanding proof that it does so. It could be that ALEC faces an IRS investigation and is trying to cover up.  30 January 2014 (UK to prosecute three men for taking food from garbage bin)  The UK will prosecute three men for taking food from a supermarket's garbage bin.  This decision is coherent with the rest of UK policy. The UK government has worked hard to drive Britons to starvation. To allow them to eat food meant for the landfill would spoil all that work.  In a place with a sufficiency of food overall, hungry people who can't afford food are entitled to steal food.  30 January 2014 (Alabama Senate on verge of extending War on Women)  Alabama's legislature is on the verge of extending the Republican War on Women by authorizing hospitals and medical personnel to refuse medical care (even in an emergency) involving ending a pregnancy.  30 January 2014 (NYC thugs beat up old man)  NYC thugs beat up an old man who was crossing the street against the light, then charged him with "resisting arrest" (he ignored their orders because he doesn't understand English). Naturally, the New York thug commissioner stood up for the thugs.  The author may be right that most thugs would not engage in such violence. But nearly all thugs will defend their fellow thugs who do carry out such attacks, and that's why they deserve the name of "thugs".  30 January 2014 (Growing inequality in the US)  The US is suffering from its growing inequality.  30 January 2014 (Reevaluation of Robert Gates by his former boss)  Robert Gates' former boss in the CIA evaluates him again.  30 January 2014 (FDA concealed danger posed by livestock antibiotics)  FDA Concealed the 'High Risk' Livestock Antibiotics Pose to People.  30 January 2014 (Study suggests link between DDT and Alzheimer's)  A study suggests a connection between DDT and Alzheimer's disease.  29 January 2014 (Costs of Privatization Hidden in Plain Sight)  Costs of Privatization Hidden in Plain Sight.  It is no accident that privatizations are set up to give the public a bad deal. They are designed to do that.  29 January 2014 (Companies can tell when you're about to buy something)  Information-gathering companies want to know so much about you that they can tell when you're about to buy something.  If these companies know what you're likely to do, the NSA will know if you are planning to be a whistleblower. The existing level of general surveillance in the US is already too much for democracy.  I will continue not to use most of the systems that would give companies such information about me. Don't be tracked &mdash; pay cash!  29 January 2014 (Companies allowed to publish rough numbers of demands for people's data)  The government has made a small concession allowing companies to publish the rough numbers of certain kinds of demands for people's data.  This is not quite enough for us to tell whether we are all being surveilled. One single order (such as the one for Verizon) can cover the data of millions of people.  What we really need is for each company to publish a figure (even if approximate) for how many people's data was actually delivered to the government.  29 January 2014 (RNA interference can be used to make pesticides)  RNA interference can be used to make pesticides, but they can go wrong.  The proposed applications vary in terms of the danger of bad side effects. Dosing bees with RNA to kill varroa mites is unlikely to result in exposing other wild insects to that RNA; if it doesn't hurt the bees, it won't do harm. By contrast, corn that generates interfering RNA can't avoid exposing all the species that live near the field, and there are lots of those.  I think that the interfering RNAs should be delivered in sprays, not made by crops, for two reasons:    The sprays would not deny farmers the right to save and trade seeds.  The sprays could be applied at particular times, which might reduce the danger to other insects that are not the targets.   29 January 2014 (Fastest-Growing US jobs susceptible to automation)  The predicted fastest-growing US jobs for the next decade are, mostly, very susceptible to automation.  It looks like the US is heading for a situation where millions of people who are fit to work can't find any jobs. The plutocrats would like to take advantage of this to force wages down for just about everyone. Instead we must redesign society so that everyone can have a decent life, even those who get no work. This could involve welfare for everyone. This could involve rejecting, even banning certain forms of automation. One way or another, it must be done.  29 January 2014 (Dutch appeals court says ISPs are not required to block access to the Pirate Bay)  A Dutch appeals court says ISPs are not required to block access to the Pirate Bay.  This is a victory for internet freedom.  29 January 2014 (Copyright industry is doomed)  Rick Falkvinge says the copyright industry is doomed, because it can survive only by surveilling all forms of private correspondence.  I wish I could be so confident. I fear that states, which already seek to surveil all private correspondence and already act as agents for the copyright industry, will extend their surveillance to the point of achieving what Falkvinge considers impossible.  There is another way that the copyright industry can succeed in subjugating everyone: through streaming. If people are so foolish as to tolerate streaming instead of having a copy, no one will be able to share.  It is clear that we must reject any streaming service that doesn't allow users to download copies. And if it does allow users to download copies, we must make a point of using it that way.  Out, out, damned Spotify!  29 January 2014 (If You Used This Secure Webmail Site, the FBI Has Your Inbox)  If You Used This Secure Webmail Site, the FBI Has Your Inbox.  This is comparable to searching all the apartments in 20 blocks of Manhattan just in case their might someday be warrants against some of the residents.  29 January 2014 (Police Banned From Enforcing Traffic Laws In Oklahoma Town)  Police Banned From Enforcing Traffic Laws In Oklahoma Town Over Abuse Of Traffic Tickets For Money.  29 January 2014 (Get governments to fund research in integrated pest management)  Can we get governments to fund research in integrated pest management instead of supporting Monsanto?  29 January 2014 (Ukraine has repealed the new repressive law)  Ukraine has repealed the new repressive law that forbid protests and imposed censorship.  29 January 2014 (Thugs in the Philippines tortured suspects for fun)  Thugs in the Philippines tortured suspects for fun.  29 January 2014 (Urgent: Use money allocated for war to pay for benefits for veterans)  US citizens: support Bernie Sanders' bill to use money allocated for war to pay for benefits for veterans.  29 January 2014 (Plutocrats often compare progressive taxation with Nazism)  Plutocrats often compare progressive taxation with Nazism.  29 January 2014 (The Dominant Grand Narrative Of Our Time)  Propaganda: The Dominant Grand Narrative Of Our Time.  28 January 2014 (Angry Birds spies for the NSA)  Angry Birds spies for the NSA as well as for companies.  28 January 2014 (Sentenced without a trial for suspicion of perhaps intending to commit crimes)  UK residents who were sentenced in effect to restrictive probation without a trial for suspicion of perhaps intending to commit crimes, who ran away and hid, are appealing the probation order.  One of them faces criminal charges for violating the restrictions of this punishment without trial.  28 January 2014 (Peru approved gas prospecting deep inside an indigenous people's reserve)  Peru has approved gas prospecting deep inside an indigenous people's reserve.  28 January 2014 (US middle class)  1/3 of the US middle class in 2008 is no longer middle class.  28 January 2014 (Snowden responds to Obama's proposals)  Edward Snowden responds to Obama's proposals for minor changes in the general surveillance of everyone.  28 January 2014 (Urgent: Stop causing deforestation)  Everyone: tell Kellogg's to adopt a firm policy to stop causing deforestation.  28 January 2014 (Obama's "Promise Zones" promise very little)  Obama's "Promise Zones" promise very little.  28 January 2014 (US bomb attack in Somalia)  A US bomb attack in Somalia killed one of the main leaders of the Shabaab.  I have no sympathy for Sahal Iskudhuq, or for the Shabaab, which is an Islamist extremist group. However, the death of a leader in such a group is generally not much of a setback. Lots of others are ready to take his place. What affects the success of the group is its power to recruit. Did this attack reduce that, or increase that?  Given that there is a civil war in Somalia, in principle the US can legitimately give the government military support. Did that government ask for this attack? Maybe in general terms.  But let's not forget that this government was imposed by outside intervention. While it now has control of substantial territory, it's not clear that it qualifies as more than a puppet. Furthermore, al-Shabaab is the result of the previous US-organized intervention, carried out by Ethiopia as a proxy, which destroyed Somalia's previous stable government, which was Islamist too but not as extremist as al-Shabaab.  It all raises the question of whether these interventions are good for anyone except arms companies, participants in the perhaps puppet Somali government, and Islamist extremists.  28 January 2014 (Right-wing US policies)  Right-wing US policies have made American workers and students so afraid of losing the competition with each other that they dare not fight back.  28 January 2014 (Taliban intimidating Pakistani journalists)  The Taliban are intimidating Pakistani journalists who might criticize their crimes.  28 January 2014 (Tunisia adopted constitution that recognizes religious freedom)  Tunisia has adopted a constitution that recognizes religious freedom. However, freedom of expression may not be strong enough.  27 January 2014 (Poorest neighborhood in New Orleans has only partly rebuilt)  8 years after Hurricane Katrina, the poorest neighborhood in New Orleans has only partly rebuilt.  Global heating is raising sea level. What would be considered today a 100-year-flood will in 50 years be much more frequent.  27 January 2014 (Right to a public trial is threatened)  The right to a public trial is threatened in the trial of Chicago protesters accused of terrorism.  27 January 2014 (DNA from plants humans eat gets into the human bloodstream)  DNA from plants humans eat gets into the human bloodstream. This adds to the reasons for concern about genetically modified plants.  It's clear that these GMOs can't be broadly toxic to humans, for the consequences would have been impossible to miss. However, problems affecting particular classes of people (perhaps depending on the details of their immune systems) are not impossible.  What worries me most is the spread of pollen. Plants do hybridize in nature.  27 January 2014 (UK press fears mandatory prior censorship will be imposed)  The UK press fears a system of mandatory prior censorship will be imposed.  27 January 2014 (Maker of fraudulent "bomb detectors" paid UK gov't to help sell them)  The maker of fraudulent "bomb detectors" paid the UK government to help sell them.  The US government also acts as the marketing arm for companies such as Microsoft. In 2011 the Indian state of Tamil Nadu switched from distributing computers with GNU/Linux to distributing them with Windows, and this is suspected to be the result of a visit by Hillary Clinton.  This adds to many other reasons for not supporting her candidacy for president.  27 January 2014 (Egypt arrested over 1,000 protesters and killed 49)  Egypt arrested over 1,000 protesters and killed 49 on the anniversary of the start of protests against Mubarak.  27 January 2014 (Anti-Government Thai protesters)  The anti-government Thai protesters, representing a substantial minority with a lot of clout, have seized and shut polling stations to block the election.  27 January 2014 (Half the children in Afghanistan are stunted from early malnutrition)  Half the children in Afghanistan are stunted from early malnutrition.  I think people should not have children under such circumstances, but women in Afghanistan are not given the choice.  27 January 2014 (Snowden says NSA does industrial espionage)  Snowden says the NSA does industrial espionage.  27 January 2014 (CIA paid Poland $15 million to run secret prison there)  The CIA paid Poland $15 million to run a secret prison there.  27 January 2014 (Using "citizen search warrants" to make gov't come clean)  Activists have used "citizen's search warrants" to make governments come clean about dirty plans.  27 January 2014 (Disaster in Fukushima not end of humanity)  Yes, Things are Very Bad at Fukushima but it's not the Apocalypse.  The word "disaster" can be applied to events considerably less severe than the end of humanity, and it clearly applies to the Fukushima meltdowns even though no significant radiation reaches the US.  27 January 2014 (JP Morgan shows that crime does pay)  JP Morgan shows that crime does pay.  27 January 2014 (Keeping ecosystems in balance )  How wolves in the US, and big cats in Africa, keep ecosystems in balance by preventing population explosions of their prey.  Sea otters protect the kelp forests of the Pacific coast; the decline of sea otters fuels global heating.  27 January 2014 (Ukraine's president offering concessions to opposition)  Ukraine's president has started offering concessions to the opposition, but the torture of many protesters and journalists by riot thugs has made the protesters so angry that they demand more.  27 January 2014 (Very urgent: Oppose provocation of war with Iran (bill S. 1881))  US citizens: phone your senators to oppose S. 1881, the bill to provoke war with Iran.   27 January 2014 (Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe sued for conspiring to keep wages down)  Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe are being sued for conspiring to keep wages down.  27 January 2014 (The right to walk the streets unmolested)  If Darrin Manning Were a High School Dropout, He'd Still Have the Right to Walk the Streets Unmolested.  27 January 2014 (Urgent: Call on World Bank to stop funding coal)  US citizens: call on the World Bank to stop funding coal.  27 January 2014 (Urgent: Drop charges against Darrin Manning)  Everyone: call for dropping charges against Darrin Manning.  27 January 2014 (Urgent: Support state laws to label GMOs)  US citizens: tell your state legislators not to be scared when Big Food companies spread false claims that state laws to label GMOs are unconstitutional.  27 January 2014 (Indian villagers obtain order to demolish Coca Cola plant)  Indian villagers have obtained a demolition order for a Coca Cola plant that sucks the water from their farmland.  27 January 2014 (5 journalists killed in Egypt since coup in July)  5 journalists have been killed in Egypt since the coup in July, dozens have been attacked, and dozens imprisoned.  27 January 2014 (The Global Elite: Rigging the Rules That Fuel Inequality)  The Global Elite: Rigging the Rules That Fuel Inequality.  27 January 2014 (Anti-gov't protesters face repression in Cairo)  Anti-government protesters (some pro-Morsi, some pro-democracy) faced repression in Cairo.  With pro-government rallies too, it is not easy to tell which side has more popular support.  27 January 2014 (UK politician threatened for not condemning cartoon of Jesus &amp; Mohammed)  A UK politician faces threats for saying that a shirt showing Jesus and Mohammed greeting each other is not horrible.  27 January 2014 (Low wages offered by employers don't attract skilled workers)  Companies say the US has a "skills gap", but really it's just that employers are trying to push wages down and skilled workers are not enthusiastic.  Even if there were enough job offers to give every American that would like to work a low-paid job, that wouldn't make the country prosperous. Additional demand for workers is needed in order for wages to rise. So we need to create more jobs &mdash; until we reorganize society so you can have a decent life without working if nobody wants your labor.  27 January 2014 (Electric cars plus cleaner electric generation)  Electric cars can reduce pollution (including greenhouse gas) provided they are combined with a push for cleaner electric generation.  27 January 2014 (San Francisco residents up in arms over rise in price of housing)  San Francisco residents are up in arms against employees of Google and other companies for driving up the price of housing there.  I sympathize with them, and with everyone that wants to live in San Francisco, and I think the real solution is to build a lot more housing space there.  27 January 2014 (Obama authorizes brainwashing techniques)  Obama banned physical torture, but authorizes brainwashing techniques such as long-term sleep deprivation and long-term solitary confinement.  Long-term solitary confinement is also practiced on many US convicts.  27 January 2014 (Medical marijuana for children with epilepsy)  Medical marijuana is the only hope for some children with epilepsy.  27 January 2014 (Corpse with deformed fetus inside to be taken off life support)  A court ruled that Texas law doesn't require keeping a corpse on life support for the sake of the deformed fetus inside it.  27 January 2014 (Campaign to eliminate toxic substances from clothing factories)  The campaign to eliminate toxic substances from clothing factories.  26 January 2014 (Very urgent: Call on Monsanto to stop hiding costs of GMOs)  Everyone: call on Monsanto to stop hiding the costs of GMOs.  26 January 2014 (Fracking in the UK)  Fracking in the UK may produce marginally less CO2 than using imported gas; but if that gas is used elsewhere, the emissions from fracked UK gas will add to the total.  When demand is elastic, increased supply causes a lower price and increased consumption. To burn less fossil fuels we must reduce the supply. A rising price would indicate success.  26 January 2014 (UK law that will restrict organized political activity)  The UK has passed a law that will restrict organized political activity, except by the companies that can afford their own lobbyists.  26 January 2014 (Three protesters on trial in Chicago for alleged terrorism)  Three protesters are on trial in Chicago for alleged terrorism, although it seems that thug provocateurs may have fabricated everything.  The intense security and obstruction of public and press access to the trial is, in effect, a way of prejudicing the jury to think the defendants are very dangerous people.  26 January 2014 (The result of skimping on higher education)  The result of skimping on higher education is that most teachers are exploited "adjuncts" with no hope of tenure and intolerably low pay.  26 January 2014 (Proprietary video games give the illusion of agency)  Proprietary video games give the illusion of agency because the players can choose the little details of what they do. The important choices are imposed on them.  26 January 2014 (Further emission of CO2 will cost business money)  Further emission of CO2 will cost business money. Given plutocratic (thus, illegitimate) government, that seems to be a crucial point to try to limit global heating.  26 January 2014 (Egypt's repression includes arrest of an al-Jazeera news team)  Egypt's repression includes arrest of an al-Jazeera news team, supposedly accused of "broadcasting false news" although they have never actually been charged.  For such a thing to be a crime indicates tyranny.  26 January 2014 (Terror bombings in Egypt)  A series of terror bombings in Egypt have been claimed by self-described Islamists.  The regime blames the Muslim Brotherhood for these bombings, with no evidence. A few months ago I predicted that some Islamists who formerly supported the MB would turn to violence in response to the massacre of protesters.  However, another possibility occurs to me. Given how much these bombings benefit the military rulers, I wonder whether some of them are false flag attacks &mdash; carried out by the military and attributed to Islamists.  Neither explanation seems impossible. I can envision Islamist extremists who continue using violence even when it is self defeating, and I would not put anything past al-Sisi's men.  26 January 2014 (Mentally ill man sentenced to death for claiming to be the prophet Mohammed)  A mentally ill man has been sentenced to death in Pakistan for claiming to be the prophet Mohammed.  Muslims who don't want their religion to be equated with oppression had better demand the repeal of laws against blasphemy.  26 January 2014 (European Court of Human Rights has demanded information about GCHQ)  The European Court of Human Rights has demanded information from UK ministers about GCHQ for a case about whether it violates privacy rights.  25 January 2014 (Sentenced to life imprisonment through a secret trial)  Chinese dissident in exile Wang Yam was sentenced to life imprisonment in the UK through a secret trial, almost as if he were in China.  25 January 2014 (GMO crops might produce the "fish oils" that are made in nature)  Genetically modified crops might produce the "fish oils" that are made in nature by algae and accumulated by fish.  Will these crops be safe for humans to eat, and for wildlife? I don't see any obvious reason why they would not be, but you can't predict what will happen in complex systems such as the human body or natural ecosystems. Only trial will tell.  It could be that it is safe for most people but a few are allergic to it. It is important to maintain alternatives, so that anyone who is allergic can avoid this.  These crops would be patented, which means they would deny farmers their traditional right to save seeds. Note how the person interviewed cites the bogus term "intellectual property" to justify the radical claim that the results of publicly funded research should be used to extract money from the public.  25 January 2014 (Why did thugs arrest three happy teenagers)  Why did the thugs in Wisconsin mistake a basketball victory gesture for "gang membership" and arrest three happy teenagers?  Because they were black.  25 January 2014 (Urgent: Call on Iraq not to execute prisoner al-Qahtani)  Everyone: call on Iraq not to execute prisoner al-Qahtani, who was tortured into a confession (like many others in Iraq).  25 January 2014 (The Modern Day 'Starving Artist' Is Likely On Food Stamps)  The Modern Day 'Starving Artist' Is Likely On Food Stamps.  25 January 2014 (Urgent: Support bill to refuse cooperation to NSA massive surveillance)  Everyone: support the bill in the State of Washington to refuse cooperation to NSA massive surveillance.  25 January 2014 (Urgent: Support the science-based estimate of the cost of emitting CO2)  US citizens: support the science-based estimate of the cost to society of emitting CO2.  25 January 2014 (Urgent: Living wage for federal contract workers)  US citizens: Call on Obama to order a living wage for federal contract workers.  25 January 2014 (Urgent: Free imprisoned Tibetan singers)  US citizens: Call on China to free imprisoned Tibetan singers.  25 January 2014 (Unreported, possibly toxic, chemical in West Virginia spill)  There was a second possibly toxic chemical in the West Virginia toxic spill, which the company didn't bother to report.  Since the company is already bankrupt, its owners probably see no reason to care what happens.  Once the spill happens, our system for preventing spills has already proved inadequate. We must inspect chemical plants frequently, and tax them enough to pay for it. They must be required to report about the storage of toxic materials, too; we cannot cater to their desire for secrecy.  25 January 2014 ("Homeland Security" attacks man suspected of "movie theft")  "Homeland Security" attacked a man who wore his Google Glasses into a movie theater, because the MPAA suspected him of "movie theft".  I would ask people to remove Google Glasses in any private gathering. It's not a wise idea to depend on them for your lenses.  25 January 2014 (Curbing global heating for the sake of economic growth)  Attempting to convince finance ministers that they need to curb global heating for the sake of economic growth.  It makes perfect sense if you want growth in jobs and income for most people. It's not good for fossil fuel billionaires, though.  25 January 2014 (Beijing to go all-out to reduce air pollution)  Beijing will go all-out to reduce air pollution from both cars and power plants. This includes moving away from coal.  25 January 2014 (Iran's president asks for western investment)  Iran's president is at Davos asking for western investment.  Western investment comes with dangerous strings, which would add to (not replace) Iran's home-grown repression.  25 January 2014 (V&auml;exj&ouml; builds "passive houses" that need no heating)  V&auml;exj&ouml;, in Sweden, builds "passive houses" that need no heating even in the coldest winters.  The US could do this too, if it appreciated the extent of the danger that threatens.  25 January 2014 (Australian gov't says it can't afford the welfare system)  The Australian government says it can't afford the welfare system. Meanwhile it proposes to offer amnesty to rich tax-evaders.  It's just a matter of priorities: the rich or the poor.  25 January 2014 (Assad has cut off polio vaccination in rebel-controlled areas)  Assad has cut off polio vaccination in rebel-controlled areas, as well as other supplies necessary for public health such as preventing water-borne disease.  25 January 2014 (The Ukraine anti-protest law)  The Ukraine anti-protest law also abolishes fair trials and imposes arbitrary censorship.  It also bans collecting information about thugs, which I presume includes photos or videos of what they do. In the US, that's not illegal, but the thugs wish it were, so they fabricate accusations against those who take photos.  Thugs have been fighting with protesters in Kiev, and the protesters have been fighting back.  Subsequently a truce was agreed, for talks between the president and the opposition. However, no deal was reached.  This report claims that the violence was started by right-wing infiltrators. I have no way to evaluate this claim.  25 January 2014 (Clever scheme for distributing anti-censorship software)  A clever scheme for distributing anti-censorship software in China.  People should try this in the UK!  25 January 2014 (Canadian gov't liquidated the library of Health Canada)  The Canadian government liquidated the library of Health Canada. The scientists are scrambling to create their own research resources.  25 January 2014 (Tunisia's new constitution)  Tunisia's new constitution seems pretty good in regard to freedom of expression, but some points need improvement.  25 January 2014 (Presence of software in products prevents people from owning them)  The EFF explains how the presence of software in products is used to prevent people from owning them.  It's a good article but has two flaws. It uses the weak term "digital locks" to refer to DRM, and refers to the confusing term "intellectual property".  25 January 2014 (Tracking phone calls to a newspaper)  Tracking phone calls to a newspaper, to find a leaker, has created a scandal in Costa Rica.  I wish the US courts responded with such diligence to the scandal of its own far worse surveillance.  25 January 2014 (General Mills will continue to mean Genetically Modified)  In cereals other than Cheerios, General Mills will continue to mean Genetically Modified.  25 January 2014 (Agricultural land as large as Belgium polluted with heavy metals)  China plans to stop using agricultural land as large as Belgium because it is polluted with heavy metals.  24 January 2014 (Urgent: Support the rights of pregnant workers)  US citizens: call on congressional Republicans: if they want to interfere with abortions, they should support the rights of pregnant workers.  24 January 2014 (ACLU sues to make schools stop imposing Christianity)  The ACLU is suing to make South Carolina public schools stop imposing Christianity (and mocking students that don't agree).  The school teaches bogus science, too.  24 January 2014 (NSA massive surveillance is illegal)  The independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board concluded that NSA massive surveillance is illegal.  24 January 2014 (Harsh punishments for minor cyber "crimes" in the US)  The US systematically imposes harsh punishments for minor cyber "crimes".  I don't think most of these "crimes" should be punished at all. In particular, net protests at a web site virtual are the equivalent of a protest on the street. It is a mistake to call them "attacks".  24 January 2014 (Bugs in Chrome turn it into listening device)  Bugs in Chrome allow sites to turn its speech recognition into a listening device.  If the speech recognition is implemented, as I suspect, by a Google server (this would be SaaSS) then Google and the NSA are certainly listening to anything you say to this "feature".  24 January 2014 (Utah gives homeless people apartments)  Utah has a solution for homelessness: give homeless people apartments.  24 January 2014 (Another attempt at citizen's arrest of Tony B'liar)  Another attempt to do a citizen's arrest on Tony B'liar failed, but eventually we will make him stand trial.  24 January 2014 (NSA and GCHQ collect 200 million phone text messages a day)  The NSA and GCHQ collect 200 million phone text messages a day, and look through them with little restraint.  24 January 2014 (FISA court judges oppose fixing problems with court)  The FISA court judges have recognized they cannot truly oversee the NSA, but they oppose any change that might fix this.  24 January 2014 (Woman in India sentenced to be raped as punishment)  A woman in India was sentenced to be raped as a punishment for not paying the fine for having unauthorized sex.  Her lover seems to have been fined as well, but it was his wife who actually paid the fine.  24 January 2014 (Drought in California)  California is in drought, perhaps the worst ever recorded. Little snow has fallen in the US west this winter &mdash; it has all gone to the center and east.  Global heating is expected to make the US southwest more arid, so this is just a foretaste.  24 January 2014 (Gates Foundations' investments)  The Gates Foundation's investments, compared with its stated principles.  The article presents the information annoyingly via images, which help the companies by presenting their logos. I see no reason to do that. Here's what the text in those images says.  Gates Foundation says: "Our nutrition efforts focus on delivering proven interventions and developing better tools and strategies for providing pregnant women and young children with the foods and nutrients they need"  The foundation's trust invested in:  Coca-Cola MacDonalds Pepsico Burger King Yum! (parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, &amp; Pizza Hut)   Bill Gates says: "As a businessman, I believe the free market fuels growth. Unfortunately, the market often fails to address the needs of the poorest".  The Gates foundation trust invested in Walmart.  Gates Foundation says: Bill and Melinda Gates "Have defined areas in which the endowment will not invest, such as companies whose profit model is centrally tied to corporate activity that they find egregious".  The Foundation's trust invested in:  Geo (The Geo Group) (Private prison company) G4S (UK Based private security company & operator of 19 juvenile detention facilities in the US) DynCorp International (Military contractor)   Gates Foundation says: "The foundation believes that climate change is a major issue facing all of us, particularly poor people in developing countries &hellip;"  The foundation's trust invested in:  ExxonMobil BP Shell ArchCoal ConocoPhillips Devon (oil & gas company) FirstEnergy (electric company) Energy Future Holdings (electric company) Schlumberger (engineering firm) (oilfield services) BakerHughes (Texas engineering firm) (oilfield services) Duke Energy (electric company) Cenovus (Canadian oil sands developer) Coal India (Indian coal producer) Chevron Total (French oil company) Peabody Energy (Coal producer)   24 January 2014 (14 things)  14 things that  conservatives compare to slavery.  I won't say that nonfree software is as bad as slavery. It's oppressive, but not as much so as slavery.  24 January 2014 (Republican wreckers)  Republican wreckers in Congress have  repealed the energy efficiency standards for light bulbs.  24 January 2014 (Urgent: Make public corporations disclose political spending)  US citizens: tell the SEC to bring back its rule to make public corporations disclose their political spending.  24 January 2014 (Urgent: Call on Stop and Shop to label products with GMOs)  In Massachusetts: call on Stop and Shop to label products with GMOs.  24 January 2014 (Urgent: Repeal authorization for war with Iraq)  US citizens: call on Congress to repeal the authorization for war with Iraq.  24 January 2014 (UK thugs anticipate riots caused by austerity)  UK thugs demand water cannon to use against the people, saying that austerity is going to cause riots.  24 January 2014 (Nobel laureate campaigns against "luxury journals")  Nobel laureate Randy Schekman campaigns against the "luxury journals" that use their prestige to maintain an exploitative relationship with science.  24 January 2014 (US adults giving up looking for work)  The percentage of US adults in or looking for employment fell to under 63%. Large numbers have recently given up looking for work.  Perhaps they gave up hope of finding a job long ago, and were counted as seeking employment only because of their unemployment benefits. Once those were cut off, they had no reason to keep looking for work that they know they can't find.  24 January 2014 (4th warmest year on record)  NOAA says 2013 is tied for the 4th warmest year on record.  24 January 2014 (The US blocked Snowden from going anywhere but Russia)  Snowden refutes the absurd charges that he spied for Russia.  It is no coincidence that Snowden is in Russia. It is because the US blocked him from going anywhere else.  Why does the US want Snowden to be in Russia rather than Bolivia or Venezuela? I conjectured last July that it is in order to smear him one way or another.  24 January 2014 (New supermarket to sell otherwise wasted food)  A new supermarket plans to sell edible but slightly bruised or wilted food, that is currently wasted.  24 January 2014 (The deadlocked Israeli-Palestine peace talks)  Reportedly Kerry wants to extend the Israel-Palestine peace talks, because they are deadlocked (of course).  Netanyahu would like the talks to continue so that (1) he can say he is trying to make peace, and (2) occasionally the US will make a concession to him.  24 January 2014 (Israeli teacher may be fired for criticizing Israeli army)  An Israeli teacher may be fired for saying negative things about the Israeli army and the occupation of Palestine. His students have taken to the street to support him.  The most ironic part is the claim that such ideas should not be heard in a civics class.  24 January 2014 (London thugs attack organizations that resist institutional racism)  The London thugs are so committed to institutional racism that they systematically attack the organizations that resist it.  They offer money to innocent victims of their attacks, but never admit responsibility.  24 January 2014 (Rule of law endangered in Turkey)  Erdogan's struggle to retain power in Turkey at all costs now endangers rule of law.  23 January 2014 (EU adopts targets for greenhouse gas reductions)  The EU has adopted targets for greenhouse gas reduction and for renewable energy generation, for 2030.  Announcing a target is only the first step to reaching it. It is a good thing that the corrupt EU governments (mainly UK) that serve the fossil fuels were overridden, but they did weaken the targets.  Meanwhile, these targets are insufficient to prevent disaster.  The big question, for civilization, is whether the US, Canada and Australia, effectively subservient to fossil fuel companies, will frustrate hopes for a climate protection agreement in 2015. They have won every time so far.  Success requires cooperation from China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and other major countries.  24 January 2014 (Many Chinese anti-corruption activists are being put on trial)  Many Chinese anti-corruption activists are being put on trial.  The Chinese government hardly tries to disguise the fact that they are being tried for political activities, unlike the US where protesters face charges of a "terrorist hoax" for the glitter that fell off their banner.  24 January 2014 (Shell blocked from oil drilling in Alaskan waters)  Shell has been blocked from oil drilling in Alaskan waters on the grounds that the threats to the environment have not been studied.  24 January 2014 (The European Union's new renewables target)  The European Union's new renewables target does not apply to individual countries; the UK now has no target for renewable energy.  This is what the UK government fought for, so that it could slow the increase of renewable energy and burn as much fossil fuel as possible.  24 January 2014 (The Russian law against "homosexual propaganda")  The Russian law against "homosexual propaganda" has stirred up a wave of private violence against homosexuals.  Advocacy of gay rights is also banned by the law.  23 January 2014 (Syrian women are organizing to campaign for peace in Syria)  Syrian women are organizing to campaign for peace in Syria.  23 January 2014 (2013 fourth hottest on record)  9 of the 10 hottest years on record were since 2001, the exception being 1998 which had a very strong El Ni&ntilde;o. In 2013, the short-term variable factors operated for cold; despite them, it was tied for fourth hottest on record.  When we get another strong El Ni&ntilde;o, we will see what hot is.  23 January 2014 (Ethics complaint dismissed against John Leso)  The American Psychological Association dismissed the ethics complaint against its member John Leso, who help plan Bush regime torture policies, despite conclusive evidence.  The organization claims to have high ethical standards but apparently will go to great lengths not to uphold them in practice.  23 January 2014 (Koch brothers paid for ALEC's report)  The Koch brothers paid for ALEC's report, "Rich States Poor States", which ranks states based on how little they spend.  23 January 2014 (Students in London supported a planned strike by university staff)  Students in London supported a planned strike by university staff.  23 January 2014 (Poor women face more abuse)  Poor women in various countries face more abuse from men and use less contraception.  Lack of money to meet ordinary needs could be responsible for both. The sense of desperation causes stress that leads to anger; some men would express that anger with violence. Poverty may also impede access to contraception.  A decent society offers everyone a decent life. This can involve having to work, but should not impose the stress of being poor.  22 January 2014 (Australian thugs convicted of shooting prisoner repeatedly)  Two Australian thugs were convicted of shooting a prisoner repeatedly with tasers.  22 January 2014 (Air pollution from China spreads smog to US west coast)  Heavy air pollution from China spreads smog to the US west coast.  22 January 2014 (Artificial island near Lagos)  An artificial island built near Lagos for Nigeria's wealthy shows how the elite plan to wall themselves off and leave the rest to suffer from human and environmental disasters.  22 January 2014 (Victoria considers laws that would empower thugs to ban protests)  Victoria (in Australia) is considering laws that would empower thugs to ban a protest based on their subjective impressions. This is tantamount to a policy of no protests but the state could pretend it is not so.  22 January 2014 (Western banks help Chinese elite hide wealth)  Major western banks help the Chinese political elite hide their wealth.  22 January 2014 ("National Security" system turned on peaceful protesters)  The US, UK and Canada are turning their "national security" system on peaceful protesters, on behalf of fossil fuel companies.  22 January 2014 (Prosecutors concealed evidence)  Bristons convicted of a protest against coal-fired electricity had their convictions overturned because prosecutors concealed evidence in their trial &mdash; for instance, that an undercover thug was snooping on them.  This is good, but prosecuting people for a peaceful protest is an injustice even with a fair trial.  The UK thugs continue attacking protesters arbitrarily; a legal advisor at a fracking protest was left injured after thugs attacked him as he was talking to them.  22 January 2014 (Syrian refugees)  Syrian refugees strongly wish for a negotiated settlement and a cease-fire.  22 January 2014 (Urgent: Stop killing whales)  Everyone: call on Iceland to stop killing whales.  22 January 2014 (Urgent: Counteract the Corporations United decision)  US citizens: call on your congressional representatives to counteract the Corporations United (*) decision.  * Officially called the "Citizens United" decision.  In my message I urged legislators to work on various corrective approaches in parallel.  22 January 2014 (Australia responsible for Nauru)  Australia has converted Nauru into a quasi-satellite and is therefore responsible for Nauru's absolution of independence for the judiciary.  22 January 2014 (Growing opposition to the TPP)  The growing opposition to the TPP means we may be able to defeat "fast track", which would make it hard for it to be ratified at all.  22 January 2014 (19 things that conservatives compare to slavery)  19 things that conservatives compare to slavery.  I won't say that nonfree software is as bad as slavery. It's oppressive, but not as much so as slavery.  22 January 2014 (People taught to despise Obama's health care program become grateful)  As Obama's health care program starts giving Americans health coverage, people who were taught to despise it become grateful.  21 January 2014 (Urgent: Answer EU's copyright survey)  Everyone: answer the European Union's copyright survey. You can answer even if you are not European.  Here are explanations of what's behind the questions, and suggestions for answering.  Here's more advice.  21 January 2014 (Urgent: Support blocking impetus for war in Iran)  US citizens: support Senator Reid in blocking the impetus for war with Iran.  21 January 2014 (Pakistani Taliban fatally attack TV team)  The Pakistani Taliban fatally attacked a Pakistani TV team, and it's not the first time.  21 January 2014 (Losing sight of what freedom is)  "Consumerism's petty liberties have made us inhumanly passive. We've forgotten what freedom is, and how easily it is lost."  My not having a TV or a DVD player and not doing internet shopping protects me from the deepest level of that strange trap.  21 January 2014 (Mining in Haiti)  Mining may expose Haiti to the "resource curse".  21 January 2014 (Global heating denial movement entirely from paid campaign)  Denial of global heating had no political influence in 1990. That movement results entirely from a paid political influence campaign.  21 January 2014 (Syrian gov't photographer defects with photo evidence of torture)  A Syrian government photographer defected with his photos, which showed 11,000 prisoners' corpses that appeared to have been tortured as well as killed.  21 January 2014 (Widely used pesticide makes bumblebees smaller)  A widely used pesticide makes bumblebees smaller, which tends to harm colony survival.  21 January 2014 (Turkish gov't prohibits offering first aid to protesters)  The Turkish government has prohibited offering first aid to injured protesters.  21 January 2014 (France considers laws to give women social equality)  France is considering a wide range of laws to give women social equality.  21 January 2014 (Millions of old files withheld from publication by UK gov't)  The UK government holds millions of old files that have been withheld from publication, apparently illegally. Some of these files go back to the 17th century.  21 January 2014 (Urgent: Sign petition against TPP)  US citizens: sign 350.org's petition against the TPP.  350.org is against the treaty because it would obstruct efforts to avoid global heating disaster.  21 January 2014 (Centralized digital medical records)  Centralized digital medical records risk privacy violations, but the UK's lax policy is turning "risk" to "ensure".  21 January 2014 (Tech companies lobbying secretly to prevent EU from taxing earnings)  A group of multinational tech companies, probably including Google, are lobbying secretly to prevent the EU from taxing their earnings.  21 January 2014 (Protesters enraged by anti-protest restrictions in Ukraine)  Large numbers of protesters, enraged by new limits on protests, battled thugs in Ukraine.  The anti-protest restrictions are interesting. The ban on amplifiers follows New York City, which restricted Occupy Wall Street the same way. The ban on masks is found in France and in many other places. These restrictions on protesters are antidemocratic no matter where they are found.  21 January 2014 (Fighting 'extremism' in Syria)  Fighting 'extremism' in Syria by supporting whoever its enemy is at the moment is not well thought out.  21 January 2014 (Iran stops enriching uranium to 20% U235)  Iran has stopped enriching uranium to 20% U235, with inspectors to witness.  21 January 2014 (Turks protest again against internet censorship)  Turks protested again on the street against internet censorship, and were attacked by thugs.  21 January 2014 (CO2 emissions 'outsourced')  CO2 emissions are being 'outsourced' by rich countries to rising economies.  21 January 2014 (Rise of global inequality due to plutocratic gov'ts)  Global inequality is rising due to plutocratic governments. The richest 85 people own more wealth than half of humanity.  21 January 2014 (Cuba moving to allow private business)  Cuba is moving to allow private business, in a limited territory.  This can be good if it leads to respect for human rights. It will be bad if, as in China, it leads to corrupt plutocratic tyranny.  21 January 2014 (The Betamax argument)  Thirty Years Since Betamax, and Movies Are Still Being Made.  21 January 2014 (Study suggests unusual El Ni&nacute;o events will double in frequency)  A study suggests unusual "extreme" El Ni&nacute;o events, which cause economic damage and can kill thousands of people, will double in frequency due to global heating.  21 January 2014 (US gov't wants to further develop face recognition technology)  Today's face recognition technology can't recognize you as you walk on the street, but the US government is setting out to develop that.  20 January 2014 (Congress wants to bar Obama from transferring CIA drone attacks to Pentagon)  Congress added a rider to a large bill to bar Obama from transferring CIA drone attacks to the Pentagon.  The reason for that transfer is that the Pentagon has to obey laws of war which the CIA secretly ignores. It is bizarre for Congress to concern itself with such a thing. I wonder if some members of Congress were blackmailed.  20 January 2014 (Company responsible for toxic spill in West Virginia goes bankrupt)  "Freedom Industries", the company responsible for the toxic spill in West Virginia, has gone bankrupt.  In a small way, this is deserved punishment for the owners &mdash; but nowhere near enough. Chemical and fossil fuel octopuses operate by atomizing their facilities under lots of tentacle corporations, so that in the event of an accident, only one tentacle goes bankrupt and the victims can't get compensation.  Perhaps we need laws to make holding companies responsible for the debts of their tentacles.  20 January 2014 (Appoint a team that can investigate anything the NSA does)  An NSA whistleblower says that the only way to do sufficient oversight is to appoint a team that can investigate anything the NSA does.  10 NSA Myths Debunked.  20 January 2014 (How many members of Congress does the NSA control through blackmail)  How many members of Congress does the NSA control through blackmail?  20 January 2014 (UK appears to have snooped on Belhaj's communication with his lawyers)  The UK appears to have snooped on Belhaj's communication with his lawyers, and played legal games to get the judge in his lawsuit to disregard that violation of his rights.  20 January 2014 (Why You Need to Fight America's Copyright Laws)  The End of Ownership: Why You Need to Fight America's Copyright Laws.  20 January 2014 (Iraqi government is attacking Ramadi)  The Iraqi government is attacking Ramadi.  I've seen reports that local Sunnis are allied with the government, and reports that they are the ones being attacked. I don't know which to believe.  20 January 2014 (World Bank lent millions to a Honduran palm oil company)  The World Bank lent millions to a Honduran palm oil company that peasants say forced them off their land.  20 January 2014 (Using arbitration rather than going to court)  The CPFB is considering whether to stop banks from requiring customers to use arbitration rather than going to court.  This is good, but mandatory arbitration is found also in other contexts, including between companies and employees.  20 January 2014 (Mayor of Hoboken says Christie blocking Hurricane Sandy rebuilding funds)  The Mayor of Hoboken says Chris Christie is blocking Hurricane Sandy rebuilding funds to extract support for a building project for rich cronies.  20 January 2014 (Specialized machine can replace human cooks for making hamburgers)  A specialized machine can replace human cooks for making hamburgers. This threatens to eliminate millions more jobs in the US.  Keeping wages low is not a solution. That would force people into worse poverty, and then the machines would get cheaper.  Although it is a different issue, keep in mind that it isn't healthy or sustainable to eat lots of hamburgers.  20 January 2014 (UK prosecutors want to evict and force prostitutes to work on street)  UK prosecutors falsely claim that prostitutes are controlled by unidentified pimps as an excuse to evict them and force them to work on the street.  20 January 2014 (Egyptians voted for constitutional changes)  98% of Egyptians voted for constitutional changes, which combine greater rights for women with greater power for the suppression forces.  I have no knowledge with which to weigh the good of the former against the bad of the latter, but I would guess that the Egyptian constitution still fails to defend human rights, including the right to change one's position regarding religion (including ceasing to be a Muslim) and the right to criticize or mock any idea (including, for instance, Islam).  The one-sided result convinces me that charges of intimidation are valid.  20 January 2014 (Tiny transmitters)  Tiny transmitters allow scientists to track migrating birds.  That's very good, but I fear they will track us too.  19 January 2014 (A few heroic Nigerians continue defending the rights of gays)  A few heroic Nigerians continue defending the rights of gays.  19 January 2014 (When Small Government Doesn't Work)  West Virginia Chemical Spill: When Small Government Doesn't Work.  19 January 2014 (Businesses that have access to TPP text give lots of money)  The privileged few businesses that have access to the TPP text give lots of money to the congresscritters most closely involved.  19 January 2014 (Ukraine has plans to adopt Internet repression)  Ukraine has plans to adopt the whole suite of standard forms of Internet repression.  19 January 2014 (An Iran Hawk's Case Against New Iran Sanctions)  An Iran Hawk's Case Against New Iran Sanctions  19 January 2014 (DMCA takedown system undermines fair use)  The DMCA takedown system undermines fair use by making it easy for bullies to get fair use taken down.  19 January 2014 (Voter-ID law was struck down as unconstitutional)  Pennsylvania's voter-ID law was struck down as unconstitutional.  This is not final; it will probably be appealed to other courts.  19 January 2014 (Urgent: Support the USA FREEDOM Act)  US citizens: Sign this petition calling on your congresscritter and senators to support the USA FREEDOM Act.  It is not enough to protect democracy from digital surveillance, but it is a step in the right direction.  19 January 2014 (Urgent: Support paid family and medical leave)  US citizens: support paid family and medical leave.  19 January 2014 (Urgent: Promote biofuel made from plant waste and cut down use of ethanol)  US citizens: call on the EPA to promote biofuel made from plant waste and cut down the use of ethanol made from food.  19 January 2014 (Urgent: Stop supporting ALEC)  Everyone: call on Google, Facebook and Yelp to stop supporting ALEC.  19 January 2014 (Urgent: Oppose war with Iran)  US citizens: call on your senators to oppose S.1881, which is designed to get the US into war with Iran.  19 January 2014 (Bizarre accusations in Egypt)  Bizarre accusations in Egypt that the US wants to assassinate General al-Sisi.  This is ridiculous. The US is more or less a supporter of the Egyptian military government, as it was of Mubarak.  19 January 2014 (Smears against marijuana)  US media repeat persistent government smears against marijuana.  19 January 2014 (Urgent: Replace the part of Voting Rights Act)  US citizens: call on Congress to replace the part of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court struck down.  19 January 2014 (Urgent: Tell Obama to stop proposing veiled cuts in Social security)  US citizens: tell Obama not to propose veiled cuts in Social Security again.  19 January 2014 (London wants to track people with RFIDs in cars)  London wants to use RFIDs in cars to charge for parking. And track people.  19 January 2014 (Poaching of rhinos in South Africa)  Poaching of rhinos in South Africa is accelerating and on track to wipe them out in 20 years.  Of course, the last few will be better protected, so it might take a few more years for poachers to get them all. However, when a species is reduced to a few individuals, its genetic diversity is reduced and it is more vulnerable for hundreds of thousands of years thereafter.  19 January 2014 (Former undercover thug testifies about practices of UK thugs)  Former undercover thug Peter Francis was given immunity and testified about the infiltration practices of UK thugs.  19 January 2014 (UK gov't worked closely with fracking companies to manipulate public)  The UK government worked closely with fracking companies to manipulate the public and overcome opposition.  It's no surprise. The UK government's goal is to emit as much CO2 as possible, as soon as possible, while slowing down development of renewable energy as much as it can get away with.  19 January 2014 (The soldiers that control US nuclear missiles)  The soldiers that control US nuclear missiles are prone to various peccadilloes which, in that context, might lead to something really important.  19 January 2014 (Obama's NSA "reforms")  Obama's NSA 'Reforms' Are Little More Than a PR Attempt to Mollify the Public.  Advocates and Digital Rights Defenders Reject Obama's Whitewash of Intrusive Spying Regime.  Obama Continues War on National Security Whistleblowers.  19 January 2014 (The small improvements in US bank regulations)  The small improvements in US bank regulations may be doing some real good: the banksters profits are down.  19 January 2014 (Obama's drone killings rouse Yemen to demand US stay out)  Obama's drone killings have roused all Yemen to demand the US stay out.  19 January 2014 (Israel considers plan to ban the word "Nazi")  Israel is considering a plan to ban the word "Nazi" outside a few specific exceptions.  Would it be forbidden to call a right wing-group "Neo-Nazi"? What about "Soup Nazi"? Would Seinfeld be banned in Israel?  19 January 2014 (Residents of Rio's favelas threatened with eviction)  Now that many of Rio's favelas are peaceful, and relatives are returning to them, they are threatened with eviction in the name of possible landslides, or as schemes for gentrification.  19 January 2014 (UK Labour leader says he will break up big 5 banks)  The UK Labour leader says he will forcibly break up the big 5 banks &hellip; a little.  Why push for just 7 big banks? Why not make them split into 20 or even 50, so that none of them is too big to fail? It's the same work either way.  Instead of micromanaging the splitting, my tax proposal would pressure the banks to split themselves up.  19 January 2014 (Acceleration of greenhouse gas output)  Greenhouse gas output grew faster from 2000 to 2010 than in the previous decades, says the IPCC.  The report cites growing human population as part of the cause. For decades this problem has been the one whose name most people dare not mention.  19 January 2014 (A proposed GMO that is probably a good idea)  One proposed genetically modified organism seems like probably a good idea.  Genetic engineering is a method of modifying organisms, not a kind of organism. The results are disparate. Whether any given genetic modification is safe (for humans that eat it, for the environment, for the rights of farmers) depends on the details. It has to be tested and evaluated separately for each GM variety, since we have too little experience to generalize about the effects. Likewise, whether it really improves anything is also a matter of details. The GMOs now in use mostly go with use of pesticides.  19 January 2014 (Ellen Brown's campaign to set up a state-owned bank)  Ellen Brown is running for treasurer of California as a campaign to set up a state-owned bank for the state to deposit in and borrow from.  18 January 2014 (Greek satirist imprisoned for making fun of dead monk)  Censorship in Greece: a satirist has been imprisoned for making fun of a long-dead monk.  18 January 2014 (Obama's campaign promise on GMO labeling)  Calls Intensify for Obama to Fulfill Campaign Promise on GMO Labeling.  18 January 2014 (Putting together what Obama says with what NSA officials say)  If you put together what Obama says with what NSA officials say, it adds up to an assassination threat against Snowden.  18 January 2014 (NYC to compensate protesters injured by thugs in 2004)  New York City had to pay 18 million dollars' compensation to protesters injured by thugs in 2004.  These compensation claims don't make up for the initial wrong, and if they don't convince the city to make the thugs stop attacking protesters, they are totally inadequate.  18 January 2014 (US military infiltrates internet multiuser games)  The US military infiltrates internet multiuser games such as Second Life, and may be using them to propagandize Americans in favor of certain policies. Perhaps increased military spending, or war, or whatever the president tells them to propagandize for.  18 January 2014 (Urgent: Oppose growing Agent Orange-resistant corn)  US citizens: Tell the USDA you oppose the growing of corn designed to be resistant to Agent Orange.  18 January 2014 (Today's marijuana impacts memory more than it did 30 years ago)  Changes in marijuana have made it impact memory a lot more now than it did 30 years ago.  18 January 2014 (Australian gov't cracking down on renewable energy projects)  As Australian heat waves get ever worse, the government cracks down on renewable energy projects.  18 January 2014 (Chris Christie's financial connections with the Koch brothers)  Greg Palast reports Chris Christie's financial connections with the Koch brothers.  18 January 2014 (Surveillance of Americans by "border" patrol drones)  More about surveillance of Americans by "border" patrol drones.  18 January 2014 (Ukraine adopts new anti-protest law)  Ukraine has adopted a new anti-protest law, banning unauthorized megaphones and also masks.  If face recognition software comes into widespread use, wearing a mask will be the only way to avoid being tracked everywhere on the street.  18 January 2014 (UN still does not screen peacekeepers for cholera)  The UN still does not screen its peacekeepers for cholera.  18 January 2014 (Man kept in solitary confinement for a month in Australia)  An Australian was kept in solitary confinement for a month, before trial, on charges of being in a pub with four members of a banned motorcycle club.  These charges, whether true are false, are obviously unjust. It is prima facie injustice to ban groups without trial.  18 January 2014 (Asylum seekers on Christmas Island on hunger strike)  Asylum seekers parked permanently on Christmas Island have started a hunger strike.  18 January 2014 (Pebble Mine would devastate salmon fisheries)  The EPA reports that the Pebble Mine would devastate salmon fisheries in the region of Bristol Bay.  18 January 2014 (Increased frequency of heat waves in Australia)  Heat waves in Australia have become considerably more frequent since 1971.  18 January 2014 (Inadequate safety precautions at West Virginia chemical storage facility)  The West Virginia chemical storage facility that leaked did not maintain adequate safety precautions, and neither does the site where the company moved the chemicals after the spill.  18 January 2014 (Distortions and lies about "fast track")  The US Trade Representative spreads distortions and lies about "fast track".  18 January 2014 (Urgent: Stricter rules on emissions from cars)  US citizens: call on the EPA to go ahead with stricter rules on emissions from cars.  18 January 2014 (Criminal gangs had infiltrated several UK agencies)  A secret UK report from 2003, recently leaked, said that criminal gangs had infiltrated several UK agencies including prosecution and customs, as well as the thugs.  This is the small-time organized crime. The big-time cheating occurs in the banks that compose the City of London, and they have made most of it legal.  18 January 2014 (Chemical that spilled in West Virginia)  Very little is known about the health effects of the chemical that spilled in West Virginia. No research has been published.  18 January 2014 (Urgent: Urge Brazil to offer asylum to Snowden)  Everyone: urge Brazil to offer asylum to Snowden.  18 January 2014 (Cesium from Fukushima has spread around the Pacific Ocean)  Cesium from Fukushima has spread around the Pacific Ocean and plankton samples contain small amounts of cesium.  A lot of the fish caught in the Pacific Ocean are showing small levels of cesium from the Fukushima meltdowns.  When large numbers of people are exposed to small levels of radioactivity, a small danger for each person can add up to a substantial number of additional deaths. It might mean, for instance, 101,000 cases of a certain kind of cancer in a population of 10 million, instead of 100,000. 1000 deaths is worth avoiding if possible, but there is no reason for any one person to go to great lengths to avoid this small danger.  18 January 2014 (Europe's "foreign aid")  Some of Europe's "foreign aid" is really loans to countries that would struggle ever to repay.  18 January 2014 (Trillion dollars a year of investment to avoid 2C of global heating)  The UN climate head calls for a trillion dollars a year of investment to avoid 2C of global heating.  Each year we wait will increase the rate of spending required.  18 January 2014 (We Can't Legally Tell You if We Spied on You)  NSA to Sen. Sanders: We Can't Legally Tell You if We Spied on You.  Will Congress dare pass a law saying "yes you can tell us"?  18 January 2014 (American familiarity with democracy)  "These days Americans have as much familiarity with democracy as they do with homesteading on the frontier."  18 January 2014 (Environment chapter of the TPP has been leaked)  The environment chapter of the TPP has been leaked. It offers toothless pretend protection for the environment.  More comment.  17 January 2014 (Urgent: Tell DOJ to hold company responsible for toxic spill)  US citizens: call on the Department of Justice to go after the company (perversely named "freedom industries") that spilled toxic chemicals in West Virginia's water.  17 January 2014 (Urgent: Tell West Virginia to hold company responsible for toxic spill)  Everyone: call on West Virginia to hold the company responsible for the large toxic spill fully responsible.  17 January 2014 ("Organic" chicken from eggs injected with antibiotics)  Wait, We Inject Antibiotics Into Eggs for Organic Chicken?!  17 January 2014 (Global heating and economic inequality)  The world cannot address economic inequality without preventing global heating disaster.  17 January 2014 (Whole Food agrees to stop selling food grown in recycled sewage)  Whole Foods, under pressure, agreed to stop selling food grown in recycled sewage sludge.  17 January 2014 (NAFTA's harmful legacy)  NAFTA's harmful legacy affects more than just the three countries that signed it. NAFTA introduced the unjust "investor-state" provision.  17 January 2014 (US gov't drone surveillance on homes of Americans)  Drone surveillance of the US "border" goes beyond what the US government says.  The "border" area stretches a considerable distance from each frontier or coast, and includes the homes of most Americans.  17 January 2014 (US farmers starting to reject GMOs)  Even US farmers are starting to reject GMOs.  In principle, genetic engineering could be great for agriculture. But not when it's developed by companies that are always seeking opportunities to cut corners on safety.  17 January 2014 (UK border guards rob Kurdish protesters of cash)  Kurdish protesters leaving the UK for Paris were robbed of their cash by the border guards who accused them of planning to give it to the PKK.  The is a rebel group; I don't know whether it is terrorist. Banning contributions to the PKK is legitimate, but taking away small amounts of cash like this on unproved suspicion is gratuitously nasty. The PKK would be on its knees if it depended on that funding mechanism.  17 January 2014 (Signs of spring in January in the UK)  Global heating at work: signs of spring in January in the UK.  17 January 2014 (Trees grow faster as they get bigger)  Trees grow faster as they get bigger.  This means that cutting down old forests and replacing them with new tree plantations &mdash; as the UK government wants to do &mdash; would require the new plantations to be far larger.  17 January 2014 (Global investment in clean energy falling)  Global investment in clean energy is falling, reflecting powerful efforts by politicians whose goal is to keep people burning lots of fossil fuel.  Billionaire Polluters predicts that greenhouse gas emissions will rise 30% by 2035.  In effect, it predicts that the half-hearted efforts to curb global heating will fail, partly thanks to the lobbying of fossil fuel companies such as BP itself.  US emissions of CO2 rose slightly in 2013 due to increased burning of coal.  Coal spews lots of toxic pollution, including radioactive fallout. The EPA needs to make rules to reduce use of coal.  Canada says it will increase CO2 emissions almost 40% by 2030, which is probably an underestimate of the emissions that extraction of oil from tar sands will cause. Furthermore, it doesn't count the emissions from burning that oil in other countries.  17 January 2014 (How Israel obtained nuclear technology)  How Israel obtained nuclear technology, with the help of various western countries, and the US was eventually drawn in to the pretense.  17 January 2014 (Stopping abuse of children does not require censorship)  People in Britain are accused of arranging to have children sexually abused in the Philippines and get video streamed to them.  Censorship laws are not needed to prosecute this, since they have participated in conspiracies to abuse those children. In general, the real abuse of real children can be stopped without censorship.  17 January 2014 (Hopeless ill couple get daughter to assist suicide)  Georgina Roberts obtained poison, then helped her hopelessly ill parents kill themselves.  It is horrible that people find themselves in such situations. It's even more horrible if they are denied escape.  16 January 2014 (German and British companies sold goods made by prison factories)  German and British companies sold goods made by prison factories in East Germany during the 70s and 80s.  The companies may not have done this intentionally, but it should not have been able to happen.  16 January 2014 (Deep debates in Iran)  The idea of making an agreement with the Great Satan is creating deep debates in Iran.  16 January 2014 (Urgent: Reject a huge natural gas export terminal)  Everyone: call on the governor of Maryland to reject a huge natural gas export terminal which would push for more fracking.  16 January 2014 (Urgent: No new sanctions against Iran)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and say, no new sanctions against Iran &mdash; allow diplomacy to work.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  16 January 2014 (The Latest election in Bangladesh)  The latest election in Bangladesh was won by banning opposition parties.  16 January 2014 (Megan Rice likely to be imprisoned for the rest of her life)  Megan Rice is likely to be imprisoned for the rest of her life for a protest in which she trespassed in a US military base. The maximum sentence is 30 years, and she is already 83 years old.  Her protest demonstrated that security protecting US atomic weapons is totally inadequate; that alone was a service. She did, and intended, no harm.  Contrast this with Putin's threat of only 15 years' imprisonment for Greenpeace protesters.  16 January 2014 (Non-fanatical Islam in Pakistan under attack)  Non-fanatical Islam in Pakistan is under attack from Saudi-funded strict fanatics.  The incorporation of lots of superstitions in Barelvism makes it vulnerable to rationalist criticism, but the replacement they propose is not rationality.  This is one of the dangers of Islam: the forms that are not cruel and harsh are vulnerable to fanatics who claim that it isn't true Islam if it isn't cruel and harsh.  16 January 2014 (Urgent: Classify ISPs as telecommunications services and make them common carriers)  US citizens: call on the FCC to classify ISPs as telecommunications services and make them common carriers.  16 January 2014 (Declaration of empathy with Indian Dalits)  US Black leaders signed a declaration of empathy with Indian Dalits.  16 January 2014 (1/5 of Britons borrowed money to pay for their housing last year)  Survey found that 1/5 of Britons borrowed money to pay for their housing last year.  This is what the totally unnecessary cruelty of the government causes.  16 January 2014 (Netanyahu's ally called Kerry "obsessive and messianic")  Netanyahu's ally called Kerry "obsessive and messianic", which is ironic given how far Kerry has acceded to ridiculous Israeli demands and ignored the Israeli government's contempt.  Israel is using these negotiations to kill time, and demonstrating how much contempt the US government will swallow from that direction.  16 January 2014 (GMOs are touted in the media as solutions to big problems)  Time after time, new GMOs are touted in the media as solutions to big problems, and they turn out not to do the job after all.  16 January 2014 (Urgent: petition against fast track for the TPP)  US citizens: sign this petition against "fast track" for the TPP.  16 January 2014 (Shooting in a school in Roswell, New Mexico)  There was a shooting in a school in Roswell, New Mexico.  It has not yet been claimed that a UFO or an alien is involved, but I think it's only a matter of time.  16 January 2014 (Senator Warren's program)  Senator Warren's program goes deeper than Mayor de Blasio's.  16 January 2014 (Dongria Kondh people deny approval for giant mine)  Under a judgment from India's Supreme Court, the Dongria Kondh people denied approval for a giant mine in their territory.  Victories like this are not final. Businesses generally make another attempt to undermine the same opposition.  16 January 2014 (Google's purchase of Nest)  Google's purchase of Nest indicates that Google wants to control the "internet of things" &mdash; and entice people into handing over lots more information about their lives to Google.  If you want something to figure out that it should turn up your home thermostat because you're heading for home and the day is cold, there is no a priori reason why that should involve any company's server. That computation is yours, personally, and need not involved anyone else.  Google wants it to involve a Google server, but doing it that way is SaaSS (service as a software substitute).  16 January 2014 (Kissinger directly urged Argentine gov't to get rid of dissidents)  A memo shows that Kissinger directly urged the Argentine government to do away with dissidents.  All the governments in South America that worked together in the 70s to crush dissent said they were fighting "terrorists". Remember that any time a government proposes an "anti-terrorist" law.  16 January 2014 (US gov't surveillance has little to do with stopping terrorism)  A study of real cases finds that the US government's general surveillance has very little to do with stopping terrorism.  15 January 2014 (UK establishes quotas for defeating asylum seeker appeals)  The UK has established quotas for defeating asylum seeker appeals.  15 January 2014 (UK thug tries to justify attacking journalism)  The UK thug who demanded journalists' notes etc. about an undercover thug whistleblower says he wants this because the whistleblower refuses to testify. The whistleblower says he won't testify because other UK thugs have threatened to prosecute him if he does.  In effect, the thugs' left hand pleads it is justified in attacking journalism to compensate for the right hand's attack on justice.  15 January 2014 (California thugs acquitted after murdering a man)  Thugs who beat a man to death were acquitted of murder.  It makes no difference that the man was suspected of a crime. That would be grounds to arrest him, but not to batter him to death once he was held down on the ground.  What could possibly have been in the minds of those jurors? Were they kept in the dark about important evidence? Do they give "officers of the law" improper respect?  All Of Us Need To Be Very Afraid Now: "Peace Officers" Who Beat Homeless Mentally Ill Man To Death Somehow Found Not Guilty.  15 January 2014 (Bulgaria considers law to punish journalists)  Bulgaria is considering a law that would punish journalists working for foreign news organizations.  16 January 2014 (Urgent: Cancel the Pebble Mine)  Everyone: call on Northern Dynasty to cancel the Pebble Mine  The other two companies have already dropped out.  16 January 2014 (Urgent: Oppose European Commission's plan to allow ISPs to censor internet)  Citizens of the EU: ask your MEP to oppose the European Commission's plan to allow ISPs to censor the internet, blocking or slowing down sites however they wish.  16 January 2014 (Thug charged with murder after shooting a man in a theater)  A Florida thug has been charged with murder after shooting a man in a theater in an argument.  I hope that the "stand your ground" law won't let him get off.  16 January 2014 (Apple trying to sabotage and replace a court-appointed monitor)  Apple is trying to sabotage and replace a court-appointed monitor whose job is to make sure Apple obeys anti-trust requirements.  I guess this is what happens when a court-appointed monitor tries to do his job right. It suggests that Apple is too big to monitor, and therefore too big to be allowed to exist.  16 January 2014 (Urgent: oppose "fast track" for the TPP)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to oppose "fast track" for the TPP.  The TPP is a dooH niboR treaty, designed to give more riches to the rich, and would do it based on taking freedom and safety from everyone.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  16 January 2014 (Net neutrality rules were found unconstitutional)  The FCC'snet neutrality rules were found unconstitutional because it didn't go all the way to make ISPs common carriers.  The solution is obvious: make them common carriers.  16 January 2014 (Rima Najdi walked around Beirut in an unrealistic suicide bomber costume)  Rima Najdi walked around Beirut in an unrealistic suicide bomber costume to encourage people to think.  16 January 2014 (President Hollande refused to answer questions about a sex scandal)  President Hollande refused to answer questions about a sex scandal in his private life, insisting that it is a private matter.  I agree. Furthermore, I think scandals about the "other lover" are to be blamed on the misguided demand for monogamy, which is tantamount to demanding "perfection or nothing".  16 January 2014 (How oil heated up factional and interethnic rivalry in South Sudan)  How oil heated up the factional and interethnic rivalry in South Sudan to the point of warfare.  16 January 2014 (UK, Poland and a few other have blocked EU-wide fracking regulations)  The UK, Poland and a few other governments that are evidently for shale have blocked EU-wide fracking regulations.  16 January 2014 (Former member of Afganistan's parliament had to flee)  Noorzia Atmar, former member of Afganistan's parliament, had to flee when threatened by reprisals from her family and her ex-husband's family.  Sahar Gul, tortured by her in-laws, faces the danger of a law that would ban women from testifying when they accuse their relatives or in-laws of torturing them.  I wish we could do something to protect Afghan women, but supporting Karzai's government isn't doing it. There isn't enough will in Afghan society to do this.  The only idea that occurs to me is to arm Afghan women and help them form refugee camps where they can defend themselves. That plan might be inadequate for various reasons, but it illustrates the though of new thinking that we have to try.  15 January 2014 (Urgent: Oppose cuts to food stamps)  US citizens: insist on no cuts to food stamps.  15 January 2014 (Urgent: Close the Guantanamo prison)  US citizens: call on Obama to close the Guantanamo prison.  15 January 2014 (Jump in number of Australians seeking help quitting cigarettes)  Plain packaging for cigarettes in Australia was followed immediately by a big jump in the numbers of people asking for help in quitting.  15 January 2014 (Individual banksters face charges for falsifying Libor rate)  Individual banksters face criminal charges for falsifying the Libor rate.  They were in charge of local trading activities, and must have been 2 or more levels down from the top management. Was it possible that Libor rigging could be so widespread without encouragement from above?  15 January 2014 (Humans can detect small changes yet not know what the change was)  An experiment shows that humans can often detect that there has been a small change in a scene, even though they cannot determine what the change was.  This mental ability provides a rational explanation for many experiences that people often interpret as premonitions or otherwise supernatural.  15 January 2014 (Unfair conditions of Egypt's vote on new constitution)  Egypt's vote on the new constitution, which gives the military too much power, is being run in unfair conditions.  Many Egyptians intend to vote yes, but the point is that the unfair conditions mean they have never been exposed to arguments against.  15 January 2014 (Nigeria imposes long prison sentences on homosexuality)  Another victory for bigotry, as Nigeria imposed long prison sentences on homosexuality and even membership in organizations associated with homosexuality.  15 January 2014 (ACLU Stops Suspicionless Home Searches)  ACLU Stops Suspicionless Home Searches in Etowah County, Alabama.  15 January 2014 (The US seems unable to end the wars it starts)  The US is good at starting wars, but doesn't seem to be able to end them.  15 January 2014 (9% of wetlands in China lost in last decade)  9% of wetlands in China have been lost in the last decade.  15 January 2014 (Apple's ibeacon tracks patrons in stores)  Apple's ibeacon gives physical stores a new way to track patrons.  E-commerce already enables the abuse that you can't tell what price is offered to someone else. Things like ibeacon could extend the abuse to physical stores.  15 January 2014 (Australia refuses asylum to Iranian woman who arrived by boat)  An Iranian woman fled in a boat to Australia, only to find out on arrival that Australia had just announced a policy to refuse asylum to anyone that arrived by boat.  She had to struggle to get medical care for her husband.  14 January 2014 (Israel shut down Palestinian landfill)  The Palestinian Authority won't allow Israeli colonies to use its landfill, so Israel has shut it down entirely.  14 January 2014 (No evidence that yoga can cleanse anyone's liver)  Pseudoscience: there is no evidence that yoga can cleanse anyone's liver.  14 January 2014 (Urgent: Tell Starbucks to stop trying to undermine San Jose's living wage law)  Everyone: tell Starbucks to stop trying to undermine San Jose's living wage law.  14 January 2014 (Ten Examples of Welfare for the Rich and Corporations)  Ten Examples of Welfare for the Rich and Corporations, in the US.  14 January 2014 (Israel shoots at Palestinian fishing boat)  Israel shoots at Palestinian fishing boats that get 4 miles from shore.  Sometimes they get shot even closer to shore.  14 January 2014 (Urgent: Plan to tie restoration of unemployment benefits with an attack on the EPA)  US citizens: call on your senators to oppose the lunatic plan to tie restoration of unemployment benefits with an attack on the EPA.  14 January 2014 (Israeli gov't asked for bids to expand colonies)  The Israeli government asked for bids to expand colonies in Palestinian territory.  When Israel demolishes a colony in Palestine that it has not authorized, the fanatical "settlers" retaliate against any Palestinians that are handy.  Even settler children age 12 participate in pogroms.  The fanatics enjoy protection from the Israeli army even in the act of attacking Palestinians.  There have been dozens of such attacks, amounting to a sustained campaign of robbery.  14 January 2014 (Man from Afghanistan given asylum because he is an Atheist)  A man from Afghanistan has been given asylum in the UK because he is an Atheist.  Afghanistan follows most Muslim countries in having legal retribution against Muslims that convert to any other position. The world needs to be more aware that Islam in political power means persecution.  14 January 2014 (UK thugs fishing for excuse to punish whistleblower)  The UK thugs are fishing for an excuse to punish the whistleblower who revealed that UK thugs spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence.  This is the way whistleblowers are generally treated.  14 January 2014 (EU farm subsidy policies)  EU farm subsidy policies pressure farmers to cut down forests for no use at all.  14 January 2014 (Virginia chemical spill and New Jersey bridge harassment)  Comparing the West Virginia chemical spill, which has poisoned the water for a while region, with the New Jersey bridge harassment.  While it was an accident that this particular plant leaked toxins into the river just now, it is no accident that the US has lots of chemical plants that have a certain chance of poisoning people or exploding at any time. That is the result of policy choices.  13 January 2014 ("lack of respect for the prophet")  Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mohamed faces charges of "lack of respect for the prophet" for an article criticizing Mohammed.  What else would you expect from a man whose name parodies "Mohammed" twice ;-).  Mauritania is not alone in this sort of injustice: most countries that identify themselves as Muslim trample religious freedom and freedom of expression. It is one of the standard injustices of Islam.  13 January 2014 (Internet does not boost democracy in nondemocratic states)  A study finds that in nondemocratic states, the internet does not boost democracy; rather, it has become an instrument to suppress dissent.  It can do this in the US too: the US massive surveillance system is the seed of what the elite will want whenever anything makes the populace desperate enough to demand change.  William Binney proposed to give the NSA a spy system that wouldn't spy on ordinary Americans, but the highest officials rejected it.  13 January 2014 (The Ugly Truth about Charter Schools)  The Ugly Truth about Charter Schools: Padded Cells, Corruption, Lousy Instruction and Worse Results.  Charter schools are a form of privatization. In general, privatization is presented as a way to make some service more efficient, but its real effect is to enrich a few. That's true in this case, but it also represents a way for the state to abandon poor people, now increasingly considered superfluous by the plutocratic state.  13 January 2014 (Restaurants replacing waiters with computerized order-takers)  Some restaurants are replacing waiters with computerized order-takers. This threatens to leave millions more Americans unemployed.  Applebees alone may cut half a million jobs.  Using an ithing to take the orders is bad for restaurant, too. It is full of nonfree software that tramples the freedom of the user (in this case, the restaurant) and exposes the user to malware  For the sake of sales clerk's employment, I refuse to use the self-checkout machines in supermarkets and drug stores. When I go into a drug store that has these machines, I shout to the people who use them, "Using those machines puts Americans out of work".  I think we should prohibit those machines simply to keep employment up.  13 January 2014 (Handing over personal data to stores)  Handing over personal data to stores turns out to be no safer with big stores than with any other stores.  The risk that the store's copy of your personal data might be obtained by crackers should not distract you from the bigger risk &mdash; the use that will be made of your personal data with permission of companies that possess it.  I won't give any personal data to a store, because I don't want my purchases to be associated with me. I won't give the store even my name.  The worst piece of data to give to a store is your credit card number. Even if it is never obtained by crackers, it will identify you to the store's data base together with what you bought.  Do as I do: pay cash, and never give stores your personal data. If you never give it, you won't learn it as a habit, so you won't start handing it over as a habit.  13 January 2014 (UK gov't for shale)  The UK government is entirely for shale, and hopes that local councils are for shale as well.  13 January 2014 (Iran nuclear agreement)  Iran and other countries have worked out the last details of the nuclear agreement, and the implementation will begin on Jan 20 &mdash; provided Congress doesn't ruin everything.  14 January 2014 (Urgent: Reject Monsanto's Biological Restrictions Management)  Everyone: urge Brazil to reject Monsanto's BRM (Biological Restrictions Management), also known as "terminator seeds".  13 January 2014 (Mosaic of mutually hostile militias in Syria)  Syria outside Assad's control is a mosaic of mutually hostile militias.  13 January 2014 (Pine Island Glacier melting irreversibly)  Global heating has pushed the giant Pine Island Glacier into irreversible melting, and will melt away over the next few decades.  This is expected to raise global sea level by just one centimeter. If only the melting ice were limited to this! However, melting for the whole Antarctic melting is speeding up.  13 January 2014 (Claims that terrorists changed tactics due to Snowden unfounded)  Retiring NSA Deputy Director Admits Agency Can't Prove Terrorists Changing Tactics Because of Snowden.  This demonstrates once again pro-surveillance officials' predilection for stretching the truth. Aside from that, the issue is a secondary one. Even if terrorists change their tactics, and even if that helps them a little, they are a secondary threat. A government that surveils everyone and thus eliminates democracy is more dangerous than any independent terrorists.  13 January 2014 (US gov't recognizes x-ray body scanners could be dangerous)  A lawsuit by the Electronic Privacy Information Center pushed the US government to recognize that x-ray body scanners could be dangerous. Now EPIC has made the DHS yield its information on test results and radiation risk estimates for airport body scanners.  13 January 2014 (Land taken away from peasants in Argentina to grow GM soybeans)  Cultivation of genetically modified soybeans by plantations has taken over most of Argentina's agricultural land, and this involves taking land away from lots of peasants.  13 January 2014 (US sailors drenched with radioactive fallout near Fukushima)  US sailors say they were drenched with radioactive fallout which caused them persistent medical problems, while their ship was rescuing people swept out to sea near Fukushima.  13 January 2014 (UK generals in Bush forces face possible prosecution)  UK generals in the Bush forces, and politicians, face possible prosecution in the International Criminal Court because they did not prevent torture of prisoners.  13 January 2014 (Dangerous cost-cutting and slipshod work at Fukushima)  Yoshitatsu Uechi, a worker at Fukushima, says he repeatedly encountered dangerous cost-cutting and slipshod work there.  13 January 2014 (Tracking company encourages stores to track customers through WiFi)  A tracking company is encouraging stores to track customers through the WiFi chips of mobile phones.  This particular company doesn't know anyone's name, but there are other companies that can relate the phone's MAC address to a name. Put those two data bases together and presto, it says who has gone where.  If the phone talks to the phone network, then the phone company already records where it goes. The two methods of tracking lead to the same intolerable result.  13 January 2014 (A few congresscritters try to smear Snowden)  A few congresscritters are trying to smear Snowden by saying that his disclosures "could" do harm to US national security.  Such a weak assertion could be said of anything you do, even getting out of bed.  Since the security of America includes the security of our democracy, massive general surveillance by the US government does great harm to our democracy.  Snowden is a hero because he gave us the beginning of a chance to defend our democracy from that threat.  13 January 2014 (Urgent: Feb 11 action against NSA surveillance)  Everyone: support the Feb 11 action against NSA surveillance.  To fight surveillance effectively, our target must go beyond the NSA. Other branches of government do surveillance too; we must limit license plate recognizers and face recognizers even if they are run by local governments.  The root of surveillance is when digital systems record data about people. We must demand the redesign of digital systems to retain little data about people in general.  13 January 2014 (Quantifying the social cost of carbon emissions)  Quantifying the social cost of carbon emissions might encourage governments and companies to take necessary steps.  If you understand that global heating is probably leading to disaster, and we don't know exactly how far away the disaster is, you don't need to a measure of the cost of short-term effects. However, that measure may help to convince short-term-minded people.  13 January 2014 (Consequence of privatizing electric generation in Argentina)  Privatization of electric generation in Argentina was supposed to attract investment, but the companies extracted money instead of investing.  13 January 2014 (UK's "lobbying" bill threatens to restrict civil society)  The UK's "lobbying" bill threatens to restrict civil society, while business lobbying will simply adapt.  13 January 2014 (Australian gov't to pay companies that produce CO2)  The Australian government's plan to reduce CO2 emissions is to give money to the companies that produce it, then let them do whatever they wish.  It also endorses cap-and-trade, which pretends to reduce emissions but really promotes pretend reductions.  That government will say anything whatever, but its actions are in service to fossil fuel companies.  13 January 2014 (Freedom of speech in Turkey and France)  Hrant Dink, martyr for freedom of speech, was tried in Turkey for the "crime" of affirming the genocide of the Armenians. Then, when France first considered a law to make it a "crime" to deny the genocide of the Armenians, Dink said he would go to France and deny it as a protest.  Turkey now plans to increase internet censorship and make it harder to evade.  Banning "hate speech" is an excuse for dangerous policies. No matter what we think of views, we must not ban their expression.  13 January 2014 (Former Merck employees claim Merck falsified data)  Former Merck employees claim in a lawsuit that Merck falsified data about the effectiveness of its vaccine against mumps, and used incorrect test procedures designed to make the vaccine look more effective than it really was.  I found out about this through a site called nvic.org, but that site exaggerated and distorted this issue by presenting the vaccine as unsafe. Another page claimed that a tiny amount of formaldehyde in a vaccine was dangerous on principle, though it is much less formaldehyde than is normally found in the human body. While that site is not 100% false, it is not reliable either.  Unfounded rumors claiming vaccines are dangerous has led people to refuse vaccination for their children, which ironically has resulted in disease outbreaks that really damage children. The most glaring instance is the opposition to polio vaccination in Pakistan and Syria, which results in permanent palsy for some children.  13 January 2014 (Obama talks about cutting taxes for business to "help" the poor)  Obama talks about helping small areas in the US with lots of poverty, but part of the "help" is cutting taxes for business.  Once a tax cut gets applied to a part of the US, businesses will push to spread it to more parts. Then businesses elsewhere say that "fairness" means they should get a tax cut too. Eventually it spreads into a general tax cut for business.  Business pays too little taxes in general. If we want to put specific zones at an advantage, let's raise taxes for business everywhere except those zones.  13 January 2014 (Polarization and gridlock benefits the rich in the US)  Study: Polarization and Gridlock Work Well for the Wealthiest Americans.  The idea that Congress is "not functioning" represents a fundamental misunderstanding, comparable to saying that a football game is "not functioning" because the score is 0-0. What it means is that neither side can overcome the other side to score.  However, that analogy goes only so far. In Congress, it's not a mere game. The two sides are "totally for the rich" and "mostly for the rich but with some concern for the rest", and the points that are occasionally scored against the poor do tremendous harm.  13 January 2014 (The US national security jihad)  The US has replaced checks and balances and rule of law with the national security jihad.  13 January 2014 (Nauru requires $7000 special visas for journalists)  Nauru, where Australia stores unwanted asylum seekers, now demands $7000 dollars for a journalist's visa, effectively saying Australia's dirty deeds are off limits to journalism.  It is an injustice to require special visas for journalists. The US should set a good example by abolishing the practice.  13 January 2014 (Responsibility for the Washington Bridge hold-up)  Exposure Chris Christie's underlings' disguised retribution scheme has called attention to bad decisions that are clearly the responsibility of Christie himself.  I won't claim that Christie must have known about this particular scheme. I would not expect a governor to personally pay attention each specific action taken, whether ethical or not. However, he may have told, or led, his underlings over the years to plan various kinds of political pressure and retaliation and not bother him with the details. That would still make him responsible overall.  12 January 2014 (Medecins Sans Frontiers has wrestled with ethical and political questions)  Medecins Sans Frontiers has wrestled with various ethical and political questions about how to carry out its mission.  12 January 2014 (Surveillance of prescriptions)  One form of massive surveillance, usually ignored, is surveillance of prescriptions.  12 January 2014 (US policy has spread al Qa'ida to many countries)  US policy has spread al Qa'ida to many countries.  12 January 2014 (Death threat for investigating drone bombing)  Baraa Shiban has received a death threat for investigating the casualties from a drone bombing in Yemen.  12 January 2014 (Most members of Congress are millionaires)  Most members of Congress are millionaires.  12 January 2014 (Pakistani internet rights group suing UK gov't)  The Pakistani internet rights group Bytes for All is suing the UK government for surveillance of its communications.  12 January 2014 (India has implemented massive surveillance of communications)  India has implemented massive surveillance of communications, with no court supervision.  12 January 2014 (Two points Gates does not mention)  Two points Gates does not mention when criticizing Obama about Afghanistan.  Notwithstanding these points, Obama is ultimately responsible for his decisions.  12 January 2014 (Feminist playwright driven out of Turkey)  Feminist playwright Meltem Arikan was driven out of Turkey by threats from fanatical supporters of the ruling party.  They accuse her experimental play Mi Minor of being a plan for the Gezi Park protests.  12 January 2014 (Call on California's governor not to permit fracking)  Everyone: call on California Governor Brown not to permit fracking.  12 January 2014 (The frequent blooms of plankton in parts of the Pacific)  Global heating may have to do with more frequent blooms of plankton in certain parts of the Pacific, but they have nothing to do with radiation or Fukishima.  12 January 2014 (Corruption and pandering in Canada)  Canada's government in 2013 displayed a record of blatant and shameless corruption and pandering.  12 January 2014 (UK pushing law to make ASBOs even more sweeping and arbitrary)  The UK is pushing a law to make arbitrary prohibitions (ASBOs) even more sweeping and arbitrary.  People could be subject to two years in prison for almost any sort of behavior that judges dislike. Protests and meetings could be banned arbitrarily.  12 January 2014 (FBI neglects white-collar crime)  The FBI has shifted its focus to terrorism, neglecting white-collar crime. The attorney general sets an example of neglecting white-collar crime by declaring the banksters too big to jail.  12 January 2014 (US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service to drop rat poison on Farallon Islands)  The US Fish And Wildlife Service plans to drop rat poison on the Farallon Islands to eradicate mice that threaten the survival of endangered storm petrels there.  To eradicate mice (or rats or cats) from an island in order to protect endemic wildlife is entirely legitimate. It is only the method they propose that threatens to be very foolish.  12 January 2014 (Lester Grinspoon convinced that marijuana is not harmful)  Lester Grinspoon explains how his clinical observations convinced him that marijuana is not harmful and should be legal.  12 January 2014 (European Parliament to invite Snowden to give testimony)  A committee of the European Parliament has decided to invite Snowden to give testimony remotely.  12 January 2014 (When The FBI Asks You To Backdoor Your Software)  What It's Like When The FBI Asks You To Backdoor Your Software.  I am shocked that anyone would agree to do this &mdash; or that anyone thinks most developers would agree to do this.  12 January 2014 (Artist not allowed to speak with prisoners in Guantanamo)  An artist who visited Guantanamo was not allowed to speak with prisoners, or even see them clearly, but she could see the evil that has contaminated the US.  Guantanamo attacks the freedom of prisoners' relatives, too, when it requires them to communicate through the Skype client, a program that denies freedom to its users.  11 January 2014 (Campaign against eating shark fin)  The campaign against eating shark fin is making great strides in China.  The only reason banquets ever serve shark fin soup is to prove how much the sponsor is willing to spend.  11 January 2014 (Life in the electronic concentration camp)  Life in the electronic concentration camp: the many ways that you're being tracked, catalogued and controlled.  11 January 2014 (US hospitals systematically gouge on prices)  US hospitals systematically gouge on prices.  11 January 2014 (NSA Insiders Reveal What Went Wrong)  NSA Insiders Reveal What Went Wrong.  11 January 2014 ('Groundbreaking' Guidelines to Stop 'School-to-Prison Pipeline')  Advocates Hail 'Groundbreaking' Guidelines to Stop 'School-to-Prison Pipeline'.  I think another crucial point is to make sure that no thugs are stationed normally in the school.  11 January 2014 (Over 40,000 people may have been falsely convicted)  Over 40,000 people may have been falsely convicted due to dishonesty in a Massachusetts crime lab. The ACLU wants the State of Massachusetts to take the initiative to reinvestigate the cases and free anyone who ought to be freed.  11 January 2014 (How "too big to fail" turns into "too big to jail")  How "too big to fail" turns into "too big to jail".  Taxing banks' gross income, at a percentage that increases with the size of the bank, would put large banks under financial pressure to split up.  11 January 2014 (Urgent: Support the Truth in Settlements Act)  US citizens: support the Truth in Settlements Act.  I might suggest going even further: rather than publicizing the details of these settlements so as to embarrass the government out of accepting weak provisions, why not rule out weak provisions?  11 January 2014 (Israel proposing to raise threshold for party to enter parliament)  Israel is proposing to raise the threshold for a party to enter parliament, in the aim of excluding the Arab parties. Juggling the threshold is the parliamentary system's equivalent of US voter suppression laws.  Meanwhile, in a complex of ironies, the extremist Lieberman wants to transfer some Arab villages from Israel to Palestine, as a drop of ethnic cleansing, but the inhabitants would rather be Israeli Arabs.  11 January 2014 (Urgent: Switch to safer chemicals and processes)  US citizens: call on the EPA to require and help chemical plants to switch to safer chemicals and processes.  11 January 2014 (Heavy rains in UK likely due to global heating)  The series of heavy rains (and floods) experienced by the UK in the past month is more likely due to global heating.  It would not have been impossible before, but CO2 and methane emissions are making it more probable in the future.  11 January 2014 (Corporations hide in cyberspace)  Corporations hide in cyberspace, with no physical address, making it hard to sue them.  11 January 2014 (US mainstream media on destruction of Falluja)  US mainstream media talk about the Bush forces' destruction of Falluja as if it were a heroic sacrifice, rather than an atrocity.  11 January 2014 (A cell phone for children)  A cell phone for children that's turns the child's whole world into a cell.  The aim is total robotic tracking of children, then old people, then everyone.  Don't make the mistake of postponing your rejection of intrusive surveillance technology till it gets even worse. I started years ago.  12 January 2014 (Urgent: Diplomacy with Iran)  US citizens: phone your senators to oppose putting new sanctions on Iran.  Give diplomacy a chance!  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  11 January 2014 (Urgent: Expand Social Security)  US citizens: support the Social Security expansion bill.  11 January 2014 (Urgent: Oppose stopping states from requiring GMO labeling)  US citizens: tell the FDA you oppose the plan to stop states from requiring GMO labeling.  11 January 2014 (Urgent: Call on Morocco to change rape law)  Everyone: call on Morocco to change the law that allows rapists to escape punishment by forcing their victims to marry them.  11 January 2014 (Being a "strong leader")  For a politician to be a "strong leader" overlaps with being a bully.  11 January 2014 (Peak oil)  Peak oil has not gone away: the supply of oil per unit time may contract, and cause economic problems.  The crucial question, not apparently addressed here, is: would it be possible to burn oil faster than it's going to be available, while avoiding the worse disaster that global heating is taking us towards?  A limit at a place that, for other reasons, we must not even approach is no real limit.  11 January 2014 (The forces in control of Falluja)  Maybe the forces in control in Falluja are not al Qa'ida.  This would be entirely plausible, except for the report that local Sunnis said they are allied with the Iraqi government against al Qa'ida.  I'm not sure what to make of this.  11 January 2014 (US protesters could be imprisoned for 10 years)  US protesters could be imprisoned for 10 years because prosecutors called their banner a "terrorist hoax".  We should tell those prosecutors to go to Russia if they don't like American freedom.  11 January 2014 (The proposed "privacy and security" act)  Senator Leahy's "privacy and security" act would make the CFAA even easier to stretch. People could face years in prison for just proposing to violate the terms of service of any web site.  11 January 2014 (Verizon trying to trash net neutrality for cabled Internet)  A lawsuit might allow Verizon to trash net neutrality for cabled Internet even as AT&amp;T trashes network neutrality on mobile devices.  11 January 2014 (CREDO Mobile reports number of times it had to give customer data to US gov't)  CREDO Mobile is the first phone company to report how many times it had to give customer data to the US government.  This information does not really tell us much, since any one of these requests might have covered all of the company's customers. But it shows their heart is in the right place.  11 January 2014 (US data brokers group people into lists and sell their names)  US data brokers sell lists of people with HIV, lists of people with drug addictions, lists of elderly gamblers, and other lists that are particularly subject to abuse.  11 January 2014 (Hidden dangers of Senator Rubio's "reforms" to help the poor)  Senator Rubio's "reforms" for US help for the poor have hidden dangers.  11 January 2014 (Global heating won't limit itself by causing more clouds)  New modeling concludes that global heating won't limit itself by causing more clouds.  11 January 2014 (Koch brother's TV ads against the recall of anti-worker governor)  When Wisconsin's anti-worker Governor Walker was facing recall, the Koch brothers bought TV ads invoking a peculiar principle that it's unfair to recall an official merely to stop him from pushing horrible laws.  11 January 2014 (An argument against the "need" for massive surveillance)  The NSA's capabilities for breaking security of specific systems are an argument against "need" for massive surveillance of everyone.  11 January 2014 (Robots being developed for farm tasks)  Robots are being developed for many farm tasks.  These jobs are done inefficiently by humans, often at very low pay and in bad conditions. If new the robots are able to do the jobs, it will be good that people don't have to live like that. On the other hand, it will not be good if they starve instead.  At a meeting in Cambridge, some 15 years ago, a man said, "If robots make it, we've gotta take it." We must not let the owners of the robots own what the robots produce, leaving most people with only trickle-down.  If you're a farmer, watch out for nonfree software in these robots!  11 January 2014 (Senegal coast guard captures Russian intensive fishing ship)  Senegal's coast guard captured a Russian intensive fishing ship. Russia's response is to blame Greenpeace.  11 January 2014 (Republican governors who solicited secret-source money)  Several Republican governors are being attacked for soliciting secret-source money to support their campaigns.  10 January 2014 (General pattern of smearing whistleblowers)  Personal insults directed against Edward Snowden reflect a general pattern of smearing whistleblowers, but the real target is not Snowden but the act of whistleblowing.  10 January 2014 (Ford says cars have GPS so they know everywhere the car goes)  Ford says its cars have GPS so they know everywhere the car goes.  This is a consequence of the fact that the GPS data is stored by software that is nonfree, not controlled by the driver or car owner.  It is not clear to me whether this applies only when the car has a GPS navigator installed, or whether it means all new Ford cars.  More about surveillance of cars in the US.  10 January 2014 (NSA whistleblowers warn about Obama's "reforms")  NSA whistleblowers warn that Obama's "reforms" are being managed so as to avoid any real improvement. They make recommendations for real reform.  10 January 2014 (The loss of large carnivores around the world)  The loss of large carnivores around the world is causing damage to plants and animals through ecological effects.  More info.  10 January 2014 (Urgent: Enforce requirement for TV stations to say who pays for ads)  US citizens: call on the FCC to enforce the requirement for TV stations to say who pays for ads.  10 January 2014 (Urgent: 60 Minutes smear of US clean energy industry)  Everyone: call on 60 Minutes to clean up its smear of US clean energy industry.  10 January 2014 (Four Years after Earthquake in Haiti)  Four Years after Earthquake, Housing, Sanitation, Health Care are Still Pressing Needs in Haiti.Aid has been misused, or diverted into plans to employ more Haitians working for export for a pittance.  What Haiti really needs is to end the US occupation.  10 January 2014 (Urgent: Oppose "fast track" for the TPP)  US citizens: email your congresscritter to oppose "fast track" for the TPP.  10 January 2014 (Urgent: Regulate carbon emissions from new power plants)  US citizens: support the EPA's plan to regulate carbon emissions from new power plants.  10 January 2014 (UK's Liberal Democrats consider reduction of data collection)  The Liberal Democrats in the UK are looking at a platform involving reducing the collection of data.  10 January 2014 (US electric utilities trying to stop installation of solar panels)  US electric utilities are slamming the brakes on installation of solar panels, and homeowners are fighting back. I've heard that the same is happening in Spain.  Many homeowners would be delighted to disconnect from the electrical grid, and depend on their own solar power and their own batteries. If they use heavy equipment such as washing machines only when the sun shines, and leave refrigerators closed at night, it might work. However, some cities in California prohibit this: I'm told that in San Jose, a house with no electric utility account will be condemned just for that.  10 January 2014 (Campaign in UK to reduce sugar in foods)  A campaign in the UK to reduce the general level of sugar in foods.  10 January 2014 (NSA critics meet with White House Officials)  NSA's Harshest Critics Meeting With White House Officials Tomorrow.  10 January 2014 (Last-ditch scheme to block mandatory labeling of GMOs)  A last-ditch scheme to block mandatory labeling of GMOs: a scheme for voluntary labeling.  10 January 2014 (California Introduces Landmark Bill to Deny the NSA State Resources)  California Introduces Landmark Bill to Deny the NSA State Resources.  This effort is good because it is resistance, but a real solution can't be reached in this direction.  10 January 2014 (20 million Indians work making bricks)  20 million Indians work making bricks, many of them children, and many of them as slave labor.  10 January 2014 (Urgent: Demand a clean minimum wage bill)  Citizens of Massachusetts: demand a clean minimum wage bill that doesn't cut unemployment benefits.  10 January 2014 (Urgent: Oppose HR 2279)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and say, oppose HR 2279, which would turn the laws requiring cleanup of polluted land into a sham.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  09 January 2014 (Inequality)  While it's the cold that directly kills homeless people, the underlying cause is the inequity that makes them poor and therefore homeless.  09 January 2014 (NSA wants to have companies accumulate dossiers)  The NSA wants to have companies accumulate dossiers for the NSA to look at later.  To a large extent, this is how the massive surveillance system already works.  09 January 2014 (Thugs in Nebraska seized the victims' cameras)  Thugs in Nebraska seized the victims' cameras that held proof of their crimes, but fortunately there was a third camera.  There won't always be another camera. For thugs to seize or destroy cameras or their contents should be a crime, regardless of other circumstances.  09 January 2014 (Fans of Insane Clown Posse sue the US for harassment)  The fans of Insane Clown Posse are suing the US for harassing them by labeling them as gang members.  09 January 2014 (UK ISPs take on liability by applying censorship)  UK ISPs, by applying censorship, have made themselves liable for anything illegal that they do transmit.  I fear that the UK government will respond by immunizing them.  09 January 2014 (Incidence of hypoglycemia highest at month's end)  The incidence of hypoglycemia is highest at the end of the month, because poor people with diabetes have spent the month's money and can't afford food.  The solution is difficult if we accept as immutable that they can't get more money. However, Congress could give them more money easily enough. The problem is ill will.  Is America Ready for a New War on Poverty?  08 January 2014 (Superbugs in chicken meat)  Mystery: why does chicken meat from chicken never exposed to antibiotics carry superbugs just as often as other chicken?  08 January 2014 (Jury rules London thugs lawfully shot Mark Duggan)  The jury ruled that London thugs lawfully shot Mark Duggan.  It's possible that the thugs really believed Duggan had a gun. It's possible he did have one, in the box. It's possible the thug who shot Duggan really believed at the time that the gun was in his hand. These are not implausible.  But it seems clear that someone other than Duggan put the sock-covered gun on the other side of the fence, and the obvious suspects are thugs trying to make the shooting look justified.  I think that calls for its own investigation.  08 January 2014 (Antibiotic resistance is creeping up on us)  Warning: antibiotic resistance is creeping up on us.  08 January 2014 (Wetlands contaminated with neonicotinoid pesticides)  Wetlands are being contaminated with neonicotinoid pesticides, which threatens disastrous effects on wildlife.

When the article says "Linux operating system", I think it really does mean Linux &mdash; the kernel Linux, not a complete operating system such as GNU/Linux.  08 January 2014 (Enforcement of laws to protect forest in Brazilian Amazonia)  In Brazilian Amazonia, enforcement of laws to protect the forest is so weak that the loggers barely put a fig leaf over it.  08 January 2014 (Puncturing the argument for keeping Bush forces in Iraq)  Puncturing the right-wing claim that the US should have kept the Bush forces in Iraq.  08 January 2014 (USDA's limited standards for approving GMOs)  The USDA's standards for approving GMOs are limited to such narrow concerns that they are little different from deregulation.  08 January 2014 (Activists in 1971 stole FBI documents to prove wrongdoing)  In 1971, heroic activists stole FBI documents that proved the FBI was infiltrating US dissidents.  They found that the FBI had specifically tried to blackmail Martin Luther King Jr. into committing suicide.  One of the activists explains what they did and why.  08 January 2014 (Droughts in Australia)  Large parts of Australia are stricken by drought again, after just a couple of years of adequate rain since the previous drought.  This combines with the effects of the hot weather. Global heating is expected to make Australia more arid as well as generally hotter. It is also expected to reduce global food production; indeed, it seems to be already doing so.  08 January 2014 (India imposes usual tax rate on commercial use of US embassy grounds)  India has imposed the usual tax rate on commercial use of the grounds of the US embassy.  Bravo for this, but the government of India would do a lot more good for Indians by cracking down on inadequate wages for Indian workers, whether they are working in the US or in India.  08 January 2014 (Urgent: Oppose requiring women to prove rape to justify abortion)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to oppose bill HR.7, which would require women who were made pregnant by rape to prove the rape to justify an abortion.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  08 January 2014 (The sublet/resale economy)  The "sharing economy" smears the word "sharing" &mdash; "sublet/resale economy" would be a better term. And note that these activities generate few jobs, so they can't solve society's real problems.  08 January 2014 (Congress must hold a real investigation of the NSA)  Congress must hold a real investigation of the NSA.  08 January 2014 (UK gov't guided by meetings with lobbyists)  The UK government considered making alcohol more expensive to encourage people to drink less, but changed course after 130 meetings with lobbyists.  08 January 2014 (Using SO2 to cancel global heating would cause massive droughts)  Pumping sulfur dioxide into the air could cancel global heating, but it would cause massive droughts.  08 January 2014 (Israeli intelligence continues using torture)  Israeli intelligence continues using torture, distorting a Supreme Court ruling against torture into meaninglessness.  08 January 2014 (Professor Ahmad Qatamesh freed from Israeli prison)  Professor Ahmad Qatamesh has been freed from Israeli prison after 2.5 years. He was never charged with a crime, and Amnesty International pushed for his release.  08 January 2014 (Gov't of Ghana wants to close refuges for people accused of witchcraft)  The government of Ghana wants to close the refuges for people accused of witchcraft; this is likely to cause those people to be killed.  08 January 2014 (Comparing Arab and Israeli racist insults)  Comparing Arab and Israeli racist insults.  07 January 2014 (Protest in Burma against jailing of journalist)  Journalists in Burma protested the jailing of a journalist.  The charges are typical of states that want to punish journalism and pretend that it is something else.  07 January 2014 (Stealing Honduran peasants' land to avoid cutting emissions)  Honduran peasants' land was stolen to grow palm oil, which provides "carbon offsets" for international businesses, so they can avoid cutting emissions. Crushing the resistance peasants' resistance seems to have part of the motive for the coup.  Emissions trading is a mistake in general; it has been gamed so much that it achieves nothing, while promoting evil like this in Honduras. A tax on fuels can't be gamed.  07 January 2014 (Al-Nusra among Syrians fighting the Islamic State of Iraq)  The Syrians fighting the Islamic State of Iraq include al-Nusra, another al-Qa'ida supporter.  07 January 2014 (Wind energy projects canceled due to cuts in UK support)  Cuts in UK support for offshore wind energy has led to cancellation of many projects.  07 January 2014 (Spain reduces fossil fuel use in electricity)  Spain reduced fossil fuel use in electricity by around 30% last year due mainly to installation of a lot of renewable energy generators.  07 January 2014 (Reducing the number of birds and bats killed by wind turbines)  Various methods are being tested to reduce the numbers of birds and bats that are killed by wind turbines.  07 January 2014 (New Jersey ignores accusations about attacks by thugs)  New Jersey ignores 99% of accusations about attacks by thugs.  07 January 2014 (Theft of Americans' retirement funds)  Stealing Americans' retirement funds in 4 despicable steps.  07 January 2014 (Network of pollinator species could collapse suddenly)  The network of pollinator species and the plants that depend on them could collapse suddenly if it is stressed past a certain point. 07 January 2014 (Climate Change Imperils Peru's Drive to End Poverty)  Climate Change Imperils Peru's Drive to End Poverty.  06 January 2014 (US mainstream media disparages idea of punishing banksters)  US mainstream media persistently disparage the idea that banksters should be punished for well-documented crimes, including the fraudulent foreclosures against thousands (maybe millions) of American homeowners.  07 January 2014 (Obama gave up on the war in Afghanistan in 2011)  Obama gave up on the war in Afghanistan in 2011.  So why didn't he end the war? Fear of being called a quitter, I guess.  07 January 2014 (Gov't has responsibility to fight poverty)  86% of Americans believe the government has the responsibility to fight poverty.  The fact that so many politicians are elected who oppose this is a measure of voter suppression and dishonesty of the media.  07 January 2014 (JPMorgan Chase banking scandals)  JPMorgan Chase seems to be involved in just about every banking scandal.  07 January 2014 (Boeing imposed pay and benefit cuts on workers)  Highly profitable Boeing has imposed pay and benefit cuts on its workers by threatening to move production.  This is, of course, what the rich generally want to do: pay workers less. Laws and treaties need to be changed so that they can't.  07 January 2014 (Body of brain-dead woman who is 20 weeks pregnant is being kept alive)  The body of a brain-dead woman in Texas who is 20 weeks pregnant is being kept alive so the fetus can be born.  This might make sense if the father wanted that baby as a relic of his deceased wife &mdash; which he doesn't &mdash; except that nobody knows whether it is healthy.  07 January 2014 (Extreme cold in US may be due to heating of the Arctic)  Paradoxically, the extreme cold in the US today may be due to to the heating of the Arctic.  07 January 2014 (Urgent: Call on Disney to stop promoting fracking to children)  In the US: Call on Disney to stop promoting fracking to children.  07 January 2014 (Measurements of atmospheric CO2 may come to an end)  The longest running sequence of measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentration may come to an end because funding has been cut.  07 January 2014 (Wild dolphin keeps trying to play with humans)  A wild dolphin that lives near the Australian coast keeps trying to play with humans and ignores other dolphins.  There are reasons to avoid accustoming wild animals to people, but when that has already occurred, there's no use denying it. At some point, we might as well accept that this dolphin needs human company.  07 January 2014 (Complaints that fracking wells harmed water supplies in he US)  There have been thousands of complaints that fracking wells harmed water supplies in he US. Only a few of the complaints have been confirmed, and maybe many of them are spurious. However, I suspect that the tests miss some real problems.  Secrecy about what chemicals are used in the wells may make it hard to confirm that contamination is due to fracking.  07 January 2014 (AT&T invites web services to pay to for exemption from data caps)  AT&T invites web services to pay to for exemption from data caps, thus proving the supposed reason for data caps does not exist.  The result will be to give bigger companies an advantage of smaller competitors.  Of course, many of these services are bad in their nature, such as the movie rentals with DRM. But that's an independent issue.  Please don't refer to web pages as "content".  07 January 2014 (Urgent: Stop the robbing and swindling of workers in Haiti)  Everyone: call on Hanes to stop robbing and swindling workers in Haiti.  07 January 2014 (The EU's commitments to free expression: Libel and privacy)  The EU's commitments to free expression: Libel and privacy.  07 January 2014 (Rhinos)  It appears that rhinos can no longer survive in Kenya except in special sanctuaries. And maybe not even there.  07 January 2014 (Digital Rights Ireland needs help coping with legal costs)  Digital Rights Ireland asks for help coping with legal costs imposed when it asked for permission to intervene in a trial and was denied.  If not helped, the organization could get shut down.  07 January 2014 (CIA lawyer approved torture)  CIA Lawyer: Stopping Torture 'Would Have Been Easy,' But I Approved It Anyway.  07 January 2014 (Proof that governments can reduce poverty)  LBJ's War on Poverty cut poverty in the US by 40%.  It proves that governments can reduce poverty. But then right-wingers took power, put an end to these efforts, and drove poverty up again.  07 January 2014 (Conservative media platform for global heating denial)  Conservative media provide a platform to the 3% of climate scientists who deny global heating, and don't mention how their predictions have proved wrong in the past.  07 January 2014 (Enemies of al Qa'ida in Syria include other Islamist groups)  The enemies of al Qa'ida in Syria include other Islamist groups.  07 January 2014 (Five Australians face charges for staying in the same hotel)  Five Australians face charges of being members of a motorcycle gang and staying in the same hotel. Being in a hotel is not a crime for people in general, only for them.  Next will they pass a law making it a crime to breathe and have your name?  07 January 2014 (Thousands of bats killed by heat wave in Australia)  A heat wave killed thousands of bats in an area of Australia.  In a couple of decades, none of those bats will live anywhere near.  07 January 2014 (Building a house near the coast)  New South Wales gave permission to build a house near the coast, on condition it be demolished in 20 years if sea level rises as expected.  It is a kind of foresight &mdash; at least it does not ignore the issue &mdash; but it seems wasteful and foolish to build a house that will need to be demolished in 20 years.  What the court appears to have done is much more foolish: permission with no foresight at all.  07 January 2014 (Judging who to hire based on Facebook pages)  Judging who to hire based on Facebook pages seems to be completely ineffective. (As well as an invasion of privacy.)  07 January 2014 (Stockpile of confiscated ivory destroyed)  China has destroyed a large stockpile of confiscated ivory to campaign against buying ivory.  I can't understand the mentality of a person who would buy something totally frivolous at the cost of rushing a species to extinction.  07 January 2014 (Overfishing of bluefin tuna)  Bluefin tuna are so overfished that most of the fish caught are juveniles.  07 January 2014 (Failure to start peace negotiations in South Sudan)  Peace negotiations in South Sudan failed to get started.  Part of the basis for the fighting is tribal hatred, but when interethnic hostility reaches the point of fighting, often it has been stirred up by politicians.  I have a suspicion that the oil in the ground has something to do with it, and that the US government is playing some sort of game to get control of that oil.  07 January 2014 (More punishment for Britons)  The UK government announces more punishment for Britons on the way to a mythical, meaningless "recovery".  06 January 2014 ("The [unlikely] possibility of success is used to call the majority of people failures")  "The [unlikely] possibility of success is used to call the majority of people failures."  06 January 2014 (US gov't didn't need any more surveillance to stop the Sep 11 attacks)  The US government didn't need any more surveillance to stop the Sep 11 attacks. It had plenty of warnings &mdash; here are the details.  06 January 2014 (Even to preserve public domain requires a fight)  Even to preserve the public domain from further attacks requires a fight.  Preserving the public domain is not enough. Copyright is too restrictive and we must reduce it.  06 January 2014 (US gov't goes to cruel extremes to collect college debt)  The US government goes to cruel extremes to collect college debt.  The idea that the US government needs to collect student loans from those who are unable to work is absurd. The only "economy" that depends on collecting this money is that of the evil rich. Even asking students to pay for college is right-wing. If they have to pay, it should be based on their incomes, as in the Oregon plan.  What's more, a large part of these debts were for payments to for-profit colleges that tend to be a waste of money in the first place. By allowing loans for those colleges, the government entices people into debts they can't pay.  06 January 2014 (Drug trafficking involves lots of killing)  Drug trafficking involves lots of killing; the number murdered, over decades, may amount to millions.  Those directly responsible are the killers. Drug users help create the circumstances that encourage the traffickers/killers, but they are not alone in doing so. Prohibition plays an equally crucial role.  06 January 2014 (Rich Republicans have put 50 million dollars into defeating Tea Party loonies)  Rich Republicans have put 50 million dollars into defeating Tea Party loonies whose risible statements have imperiled their dooH niboR agenda.  06 January 2014 (The Canadian gov't trashed archives of scientific data and research)  The Canadian government trashed archives of scientific data and research, especially pertaining to the environment.  Canadian scientists say this was done to sabotage informed resistance to the extractivist agenda.  06 January 2014 (Urgent: Oppose new sanctions against Iran)  US citizens: call on your senators to oppose new sanctions against Iran. Give diplomacy a chance.  06 January 2014 (Long-term unemployment)  Long-term unemployment makes many young people despair and think of suicide.  06 January 2014 (The "defensive patent license")  The "defensive patent license" ought to be called the "still offensive patent license", because of the exclusion of anything it calls a "clone" &mdash; which is itself dishonest, since it the way they define it, it includes a lot more than clones. It includes any similar functionality.  Apple could license its patents this way and still use them against free software smart phones.  06 January 2014 (US plagued by redistributionist politicians)  The US is plagued by redistributionist politicians, redistributing as usual to the rich.  I'm proud to be a redistributionist: I say we should move that money back.  06 January 2014 (Peer pressure turns children into competitive consumers)  Peer pressure turns children into competitive consumers.  06 January 2014 (NSA refuses to say whether it snoops on Congress)  The NSA refuses to say whether it snoops on Congress.  I suspect it makes special efforts to snoop on Congresscritters, in order to blackmail them.  06 January 2014 (Underfunding of medical care in UK kills people)  Underfunding of medical care in the UK kills people by slowing down the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.  06 January 2014 (UK gov't wants to destroy old-growth forests)  The UK government wants to destroy old-growth forests and replace them with tree plantations.  06 January 2014 (Jacob Appelbaum's speech)  The full text of Jacob Appelbaum's speech about NSA attack methods and what they can do to computer systems.  06 January 2014 (Urgent: Stop persecution of journalists in the US and UK)  Everyone: call on the US and UK governments to stop persecuting journalists that write about the wrongdoing of the state.  06 January 2014 (Syrian rebels say they have launched outright war with al Qa'ida)  The non-al-Qa'ida Syrian rebels say they have launched outright war with al Qa'ida.  Before rejoicing, we need to get confirmation of what is really happening, though that won't be easy to get.  06 January 2014 (Welcome to the New America: Low-Wage Nation)  Welcome to the New America: Low-Wage Nation.  06 January 2014 (USDA wants to deregulate Agent Orange-resistant GM corn)  The USDA says it wants to deregulate GM corn that is resistant to Agent Orange.  Talk about "bringing the war back home"!  06 January 2014 (GAP statement on Snowden and NSA domestic surveillance)  The Government Accountability Project Statement on Edward Snowden and NSA Domestic Surveillance.  06 January 2014 (Fixing unemployment and inequality in the US)  The US does not have a choice between fixing unemployment and fixing inequality. Fixing one requires fixing the other.  06 January 2014 (Israel Lobby in the US tries again to kill deal with Iran)  The Israel Lobby in the US is trying again to kill the deal with Iran.  06 January 2014 (Israel's control of the Jordan valley)  As the US endorses letting Israel retain control of the Jordan valley, maintaining a permanent siege of Palestine, Netanyahu demands even more.  06 January 2014 (Idaho to take back a privatized prison)  Idaho will take back a privatized prison that has been run horribly.  For a company to squeeze a profit out of a prison, it has to mistreat the prisoners somehow.  06 January 2014 (The NY school-to-prison pipeline)  Imploring Mayor de Blasio to close the school-to-prison pipeline.  06 January 2014 (Effect of global heating in Australia)  2013 was Australia's hottest year, and for each of its regions too.  Abbott says he will bring about a small, insufficient reduction in emissions by 2020, by methods that aren't likely to work at all. Planting trees may be good in other ways, but it takes a long time for them to pull CO2 out of the air, assuming they don't die or even burn.  The new planned coal mines would swamp that.  Meanwhile, Abbott has appointed a "business advisor" that campaigns loudly to deny global heating.  We can guess what business his advice represents.  What will we see next on the Abbott and Australia show? Perhaps this: Abbott lights a match on Australia, and Australia says, "Hay, Abbott!"  06 January 2014 (The low carbon price in emissions-trading schemes)  The carbon price in emissions-trading schemes has fallen so low that the schemes do nothing to reduce emissions.  06 January 2014 (UK landlord companies refusing to rent to people on welfare)  Large UK landlord companies are refusing to rent to people on welfare.  The Tories are evil, greedy monsters that deserve to live on the street along with the banksters.  06 January 2014 (Senator asks NSA whether it snoops on Congress)  Senator Sanders has asked the NSA whether it snoops on Congress.  06 January 2014 (UK gov't to cut off another aid program)  As poor in the UK face hunger and homelessness, the government has announced it will cut off another aid program which is meant to help in "emergencies".  It would defeat the purpose of pushing millions into emergencies, if there's a program that would help.  06 January 2014 (Cambodian thugs shoot protesting garment workers)  Cambodian thugs shot garment workers protesting for higher pay.  We must put an end to the treaties that drive countries to compete to offer foreign business the lowest wages.  06 January 2014 (Australian gov't wants Greenpeace activist to pay for "assistance")  The Australian government wants Greenpeace activist Colin Russell to pay for the useless "assistance" it gave him when he was persecuted by Putin.  In effect, Abbott seeks a way to punish him financially after Putin jailed him for months.  This is because Abbott and Putin are on the same side &mdash; the extractivist side.  05 January 2014 (How MIT's callousness and exaggerations condemned Aaron Swartz)  How MIT's callousness and exaggerations condemned Aaron Swartz.  David LaMacchia set up an internet bulletin board site where anyone could upload and download files. He didn't put the files in it himself, but the US government wanted to hold him personally responsible for the files that were uploaded. US government representatives systematically smeared LaMacchia, who on his lawyer's advice did not dare say they were wrong; but he had already explained the facts to people at the Artificial Intelligence Lab, and that's where I heard them. This article repeats the givernment's claim.  The government used this smear to push for the passage of the law that criminalized noncommercial sharing on the Internet, an attack on our rights that we will have to fight to undo.  05 January 2014 (US puts nonviolent accused "terrorists" in solitary confinement for years)  The US regularly puts nonviolent accused "terrorists" in solitary confinement for years, blocking them from discussing their cases properly with their lawyers, and eventually gets them to plead guilty after their minds have broken.  05 January 2014 (US prosecution of thoughtcrime)  US suppression of possible Muslim "radicalization" has been stretched to the point of prosecution of thoughtcrime.  You don't have to be Islamist, or even Muslim, to think that people in a country conquered by the US have the right to resist occupation. Anyone who hates oppression believes that. Why shouldn't Muslims say that?  On the other hand, anyone who is such a "good" Muslim as to support Islam's contempt for women, its cruel Shari'a law, or its disrespect for everyone's religious freedom, deserves plenty of criticism. You can't duck the odium of those views by saying it's a religion.  05 January 2014 (Urgent: Do not turn the Endangered Species Act into a hollow absurdity)  US citizens: Sign this petition calling on Congress not to turn the Endangered Species Act into a hollow absurdity.  05 January 2014 (Urgent: Sign petition calling for prosecution of Clapper)  US citizens: sign this petition calling for prosecution of Clapper for lying to Congress.  05 January 2014 (Urgent: Sign this petition for Obama to give Snowden amnesty)  US citizens: sign this petition for Obama to give Snowden amnesty.  And this one: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/pardon-edward-snowden/Dp03vGYD  There is another campaign asking people to fax Obama copies of the New York Times editorial that says Snowden should be offered a reduced punishment. I think that is an insult to a hero, and I didn't support it. I support this instead.  05 January 2014 (Just about all the sides fighting against al Qa'ida)  Just about all the sides in Syria and Iraq are fighting against al Qa'ida. Even some other Islamist militias.  The defeat of al Qa'ida would mean the defeat of the worst sort of fanaticism. However, if the other Islamist militias are part of the winning side, I fear that women, human rights and non-Muslims in those areas will still be on the losing side.  05 January 2014 (Taliban attacked and murdered foreign climbers on a mountain in Pakistan)  Taliban attacked and murdered foreign climbers on a mountain in Pakistan, as an intentional reprisal against people who had nothing to do with the war.  This is much nastier than US drone attacks. Imagine if the US had deliberately targeted a wedding party while believing that everyone there was a noncombatant, and you'd have an equivalent for this.  Pakistan says it has arrested those responsible.  05 January 2014 (US participated directly when Columbia attacked FARC camp in Ecuador)  The US participated directly when Colombia attacked a FARC camp just across the border in Ecuador.  The argument that a state has the right to fight its enemies when they are sheltered by another state is valid in some circumstances, but one must look at the rest of the situation. For instance, did the Ecuadorian government shelter or sponsor that camp (or even know about it)? Did Colombia ask Ecuador for assistance in dislodging it?  There may be other relevant factors. The Colombian state was and still is closely connected with the worst terrorist group in Colombia, the paramilitaries.  Although the FARC have degenerated into drug trafficking and kidnap for profit, they are still better than the paramilitaries. Is support for the FARC justified on these grounds?  05 January 2014 (Michael Moore: The Obamacare We Deserve)  Michael Moore: The Obamacare We Deserve.  I'm a real Liberal, and Obama is hardly much of a Liberal, so I don't silence my views to support him.  05 January 2014 (Israel Cages Palestinian Children in Outdoor Holding Pens During Freezing Storm)  Israel Cages Palestinian Children in Outdoor Holding Pens During Freezing Storm.  04 January 2014 (Employees of M&egrave;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res seem to have been kidnaped in Syria)  Employees of M&egrave;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res seem to have been kidnaped in Syria.  04 January 2014 (Ralph Nader calls on Dubya)  Ralph Nader calls on Dubya to accept responsibility for turning Iraq into a place of horror.  04 January 2014 (Urgent: Extend unemployment benefits)  US citizens: call on the Senate to extend unemployment benefits.  04 January 2014 (Bretons protesting tax on truck travel)  Bretons are protesting and destroying cameras to prevent implementation of a tax on truck travel.  Taxes like this are necessary to conserve fuel, and the pain they impose is nothing compared to the pain they will avoid. I think the protesters are making a mistake &mdash; like protesting about a visit to the dentist.  The tax money should be to stimulate the economy in other ways.  04 January 2014 (Iraqi state allied with non-radical Sunnis)  The Iraqi state has allied with non-radical Sunnis to fight al Qa'ida.  If Sunnis and Shi'ites can work together, it might offer some hope for ending the terror in Iraq.  04 January 2014 (Urgent: Ban hunting dolphins to use as bait for sharks)  Everyone: call on Peru to ban hunting dolphins to use as bait for sharks.  The dolphins are not endangered, but the sharks are on the road to being wiped out.  03 January 2014 (Urgent: Oppose cuts in food stamps)  US citizens: tell the Senate, no cuts in food stamps!  03 January 2014 (UK's "back to work" schemes)  UK local governments use "back to work" schemes as a way to make people do real work for much less than the minimum wage.  03 January 2014 (UK austerity to create wave of mass homelessness)  UK austerity is about to create a wave of mass homelessness.  03 January 2014 (Newly released papers expose lies by and about Margaret Thatcher)  Newly released papers expose several lies by and about Margaret Thatcher.  In particular, there was her lie to the striking miners, claiming she had no plans to close additional mines. What else would right-wing politicians do besides lie?  03 January 2014 (India rich, but half of all Indians abjectly poor)  Selling out to business has made India rich, while making half of all Indians abjectly poor.  What India needs most is to provide reliable modern contraception to every woman in India.  03 January 2014 (UK's "porn filter" a system of outsourced state censorship)  The UK's "porn filter" is a system of outsourced state censorship, based on the standard idiotic excuse.  03 January 2014 (Mesh networks)  Mesh networks could make the internet more flexible and reduce surveillance.  03 January 2014 (Iceland's ice melting fast)  Iceland's ice is melting fast, and when it goes, Iceland will be short of water.  Its longest bridge spans a river that has gone permanently dry.  03 January 2014 (The plan to remove grey wolf from endangered species list)  The plan to remove the grey wolf from the endangered species list is based on twisting the meaning of the law so as to make it systematically ineffective.  03 January 2014 (Physical surveillance devices that can be installed on computers)  Information about the tiny physical surveillance devices that the NSA (or anyone) can install.  I am not especially bothered by the NSA's having these, since they won't be installed everywhere (and in the US would require a court order). What's dangerous to democracy is general surveillance applied to everyone.  03 January 2014 (Rapists murder Indian girl who reported rapes)  An Indian girl who reported rapes was subsequently murdered by the rapists.  03 January 2014 (Planned mines in Sweden threaten reindeer)  Giant mines planned in Sweden will block reindeer migration, and dust spread by the mines will kill reindeer anyway.  03 January 2014 (Global heating melts continental ice and increases sea ice)  If someone tells you that the ship now caught in sea ice near Antarctica disproves global heating, here's the real science.  03 January 2014 (Software freedom on farms)  The software freedom fight comes to the farm, as computerized farm machines have created a battle over whether farms will control their own computing and data, or be prey to Monsanto and other large companies.  It's regrettable that this idealistic author adopts the anti-idealistic term "open source", which was designed to suppress this sort of idealism. Clearly, the suppression does not work 100%, but it continues to weaken our movement.  03 January 2014 (An Economy That Benefits Ordinary People?)  An Economy That Benefits Ordinary People? What We Learned From the 1%.  How to reverse financialization.  03 January 2014 (Iraq's deadliest year since 2008)  2013 was Iraq's deadliest year since 2008.  03 January 2014 (Republicans plan new impediments to abortion)  Republicans are planning a new series of artificial impediments to abortion.  Considering the many ways not having an abortion can harm a woman &mdash; before, during, and years after birth &mdash; it would make more sense to require a waiting period for the decision not to have an abortion.  03 January 2014 (Chomsky on rich countries' race towards disaster)  Chomsky on the NSA, earth's destruction, the loss of journalism, the downgrading of education, and more.  03 January 2014 (NSA, Benghazi and the Monsters of Our Own Creation)  NSA, Benghazi and the Monsters of Our Own Creation: the US government knows everything but learns nothing.  The same can be said about al Qa'ida in general. Despite all its intelligence gathering, the US has only managed to make al Qa'ida stronger.  03 January 2014 (ACLU trying to find out about NSA surveillance of Americans)  The ACLU is trying to find out about the surveillance of Americans that the NSA does as a byproduct of supposedly spying on foreigners.  More info.  03 January 2014 (NSA intercepting laptops bought online)  NSA Intercepting Laptops Bought Online to Install Spy Malware.  03 January 2014 (Gmail)  Gmail was planned from the start as a massive surveillance system, to make psychological profiles not only of Gmail users but of everyone who sends mail to Gmail users.  03 January 2014 (NY Times uses truncated time lines to make claims about Gaza)  The New York Times (and other media) use truncated time lines to claim that fighting between Israel and Gaza is always started by Gazans.  A few years ago it was noted that it was typically Israel that broke the truce with Hamas.  03 January 2014 (Urgent: Monsanto Protection Act)  US citizens: call for allowing the Monsanto Protection Act to lapse.  03 January 2014 (From Turing to Snowden)  From Turing to Snowden:  How US-UK Pact Forged Modern Surveillance (of everyone).  It should be noted that the US got various warnings of the September 2001 terrorist attacks, but  officials did not take the warnings seriously.  02 January 2014 (World's population considers USA to be the biggest threat to world peace)  A world-wide poll found that the world's population considers the USA to be the biggest threat to world peace.  02 January 2014 (Families applying for welfare in Florida can't be required to take drug tests)  An ACLU victory: families applying for welfare in Florida can't be required to take drug tests.  I joined the ACLU when George I criticized Governor Dukakis for being a "card-carrying member", effectively likening the defense of civil liberties to Communism. I asked myself, "If Michael Dukakis can be an ACLU member, why am I not one?" Then I joined.  02 January 2014 (22000 students in New York City are homeless)  22000 students in New York City are homeless.  Will Mayor de Blasio help them find shelter? There are places in New York City where tents could be set up.  02 January 2014 (Legal marijuana stores are opening in Colorado)  Legal marijuana stores are opening in Colorado.  02 January 2014 (Transporting oil by rail is very dangerous)  Transporting oil by rail is very dangerous, but pipelines are becoming less safe, too.  Why are pipelines less safe than previously? Maybe they are just getting old. Maybe the government doesn't require as much inspection and maintenance as before. Maybe the government has fewer inspectors, or doesn't dare fine companies enough to make them comply. It certainly isn't trying hard enough.  02 January 2014 (Global heating denialism)  Abbott is using his "business advisor" to spread global heating denialism.  Abbott warned Australia that he isn't the suppository of all wisdom, but who needs a suppository with shit like this?  02 January 2014 (Netanyahu's demand for recognizing Israel as a "Jewish state")  Ideas for compromise about Netanyahu's demand for recognizing Israel as "a Jewish state" rather than just a state.  02 January 2014 (The Israel double standard)  The Israel double standard: other countries get sanctions for violating human rights, but Israel only gets a boycott.  02 January 2014 (Palestinians in Jerusalem)  10,000 Palestinian children living with their parents in Jerusalem can't get Jerusalem residency cards, or health care , and after they reach 16 they won't be allowed to live with (or even visit) their mothers.  Required identity cards are an injustice in themselves, of course, even if not applied in this discriminatory fashion.  02 January 2014 (15 things everyone would know if there were a Liberal media)  Daily Kos: 15 things everyone would know if there were a Liberal media.  01 January 2014 (Congressional Republicans ask IRS to produce one-sided report)  Congressional Republicans ask the IRS to produce a one-sided report, creating an appearance of a scandalous political bias, which the same Republicans then attacked.  01 January 2014 (Companies cheat homeless people recruited to work on Fukushima cleanup)  Japanese companies recruit homeless people to work on the Fukushima cleanup, then cheat them of their wages.  I'm glad that there is work available for homeless people, but cheating them is despicable. (It's common practice for businesses to cheat workers.) And this work might be dangerous to them, and to others if not done right. It needs to be done by people who know what they are doing.  01 January 2014 (Services that claim to test your DNA)  Services that claim to test your DNA and predict risk of various diseases don't really know what they are doing.  01 January 2014 (Jobs for college graduates to be replaced by AIs)  Some researchers expect that 10 to 20 percent of jobs for college graduates will be replaced by AIs in the next two decades.  This is in addition to many other jobs that will be eliminated &mdash; drivers, for instance, and supermarket sales jobs.  We are already seeing the effects of this, in long-term unemployment of people who have given up looking for jobs. All economic growth goes to the rich few, so it creates few jobs. The jobs lost to computerization will not be replaced by other jobs.  If you are a young person now and you are not brilliant or aiming at a career such as medicine, I recommend that you not get yourself in debt to go to college. You'll never pay that debt off. Instead, organize for your state to adopt Oregon's plan for funding a college education. If it takes ten years to win, you can go to college then, and you'll still be better off.  Passing the entrance exam for a Japanese university is less challenging for an AI than you might suppose. Those exams focus on rote learning, so passing requires a lot of knowledge but no creativity. It does, however, require human-style common sense for the reading comprehension, and that is the central challenge in AI.  01 January 2014 (Oil extraction from Canadian tar sands spews out mercury)  Oil extraction from Canadian tar sands spews out mercury, which is toxic.  Burning coal also spews mercury.  Letting companies "regulate themselves" is a standard right-wing agenda. The conservative regime in the US is considering letting chicken factories inspect themselves.  01 January 2014 (NSA's methods of spying on computers include physical spy devices)  The NSA's methods of spying on computers include physical spy devices such as radio-transmitter USB plugs, as well as devices they insert into a computer while it is being shipped.  What this implies.  Greenwald and an ACLU lawyer comment on how Obama is the NSA's trojan horse in the Democratic Party.  We had a name, in the 1980s, for politicians with views like Obama's: "Republicans". I used to be a Democrat &hellip; until the Democratic party as a whole turned conservative and no longer deserved my support. However, we are now electing some Democrats worthy of the name, such as Elizabeth Warren.  01 January 2014 (Owners of factory face murder charges)  The owners of the factory in which fire killed 112 workers now face murder charges.  I don't think that the executives of western clothing lines deserve to be charged with murder. It is more effective to make them responsible for the working conditions of the factories that make their clothing &mdash; and prosecute every time they fail to check, not just on the rare occasions when that kills someone.  01 January 2014 (3 more Guantanamo prisoners released)  3 more prisoners in Guantanamo have been released.  The US has known for 10 years that there was never any reason to imprison them.  01 January 2014 (Obama keeps lying to whitewash the NSA)  Obama keeps lying to whitewash the NSA.  01 January 2014 (Oppression of humans by shoot-to-kill rangers in Tanzania)  Shoot-to-kill rangers protected elephants, but oppressed humans.  What can the replacement be?  01 January 2014 (Egypt applies US-style forfeiture)  Egypt is applying US-style forfeiture to 500 leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood.  01 January 2014 (Extreme weather disasters in the Caribbean)  Extreme weather disasters in the Caribbean.  01 January 2014 (Redistribution of US wealth in the past five years)  The Shocking Redistribution of [US] Wealth in the Past Five Years.  01 January 2014 (New model says 4C of global heating by 2100)  A new climate model says we are on track for 4C of global heating by 2100.  01 January 2014 (Israeli gov't backs plan to keep West Bank permanently under siege)  The Israeli government displayed its contempt for Kerry's "peace negotiations" by backing a plan to annex a large fraction of the West Bank in order to keep it permanently under siege.  Netanyahu does not care how this affects the "negotiations", since he has no intention of making a peace agreement. I think his goal is to show that he still has the US government cowed; that he can ridicule the US and the "negotiations" and Kerry won't dare make a peep.  01 January 2014 (NSA's catalog of attack software)  The NSA's catalog of attack software: they can attack BIOSes, routers, even the firmware of hard drives.  01 January 2014 (NSA's special cracking unit)  The NSA has a special unit to crack security of machines that are hard to crack.  It is legitimate to have a unit like this, but its operations must be very strictly controlled, and we cannot trust officials that lie to Congress to do that.  The comparison with "plumbers" is telling, since Nixon used the same metaphor to describe his team of burglars, whose best known crime was in the Watergate hotel.  01 January 2014 (States that vote right-wing tend to take from Federal gov't)  States that vote right-wing tend to take from the Federal government, while Democratic states contribute.  01 January 2014 (Another oil train collision)  Another oil train collided and started another big fire.  We were lucky this time &mdash; the collision took place in a deserted area and it seems nobody was directly hurt. Oil trains go through towns and cities, and we can't be lucky every time.  01 January 2014 (Urgent: Wait for Edward Snowden at the airport)  Everyone: On Jan 3, make a sign saying "Edward Snowden", go to an airport, and wait for him to arrive.  31 December 2013 (Thug infiltrators threatened nonviolent Occupy Austin protesters)  Thug infiltrators tried to get Occupy Austin protesters to commit violence, but the protesters firmly refused. So the infiltrators gave them "lockboxes" &mdash; basically tools to strap themselves together for a sit-in so that removing them would be more work &mdash; then accused them of a felony, "possessing a criminal instrument", even though legally lockboxes don't qualify.  Next time you think about how Putin threatens nonviolent protesters with years in prison, remember that the US does it too.  The charges about the lockboxes were eventually dropped.  It's not clear whether the court ultimately acknowledged that it is absurd to call lockboxes a "criminal instrument".  31 December 2013 (UK takes another step towards making NHS nonfunctional)  The UK government has taken another substantial step towards making the National Health Service nonfunctional.  If the Labour party still stood for the non-rich, this taste of what the rich do in power would give it every chance of winning again.  31 December 2013 (Refugees fleeing to Mexico due to gang wars in Central America)  Gang wars in Central America are sending large numbers of refugees fleeing to Mexico.  Ending the War on Drugs would cut off a lot of the money that fuels the gangs.  31 December 2013 (Stigmatization of those who are unusual)  The human tendency to stigmatize those who are unusual gets whipped up in times of hardship.  Plutocrats find it a useful way to distract people from them.  31 December 2013 (44 Iraqi Sunni MPs resign in protest)  44 Iraqi Sunni MPs resigned in protest of state attacks against Sunni nonviolent protesters and the home of an MP.  Iraq has been unable to establish a state that can hold the sects together peacefully. I think that can only lead to more war.  31 December 2013 (Fight against drug patents in India)  India continues to fight against drug patents that threaten to kill millions.  31 December 2013 (FAIR's year-end list of US media distortions)  FAIR's year-end list of 2013 US media distortions.  31 December 2013 (Lead in eggs of chickens grown in city gardens)  If you grow chickens in a city garden, watch out for lead in the eggs!  31 December 2013 (Tech companies that boast "disruption" as their goal)  Tech companies that boast "disruption" as their goal are on the way to being hated by the 80 or 90% of Americans who will be left with only precarious employment.  31 December 2013 (Using one criminal as the excuse to punish all poor families)  President Reagan's "welfare queen" was a real woman whose life was crime after crime against most everyone she came in contact with. Her frauds against the welfare system were illegal already.  She was sentenced to prison for some of these frauds, and it looks like she deserved it. However, Reagan and Clinton used her as the excuse to punish all poor families in America, and they did not deserve this punishment.  It is important to reduce the rate of births by teenagers, but instead of doing this the cruel Conservative way, which consists of pushing poor people's children into worse poverty, let's do it the kind Progressive way: offer taxpayer-funded reliable birth control to every teenager.  31 December 2013 (Benjamin Franklin set example of leaking)  Benjamin Franklin set an example of leaking, 240 years before Manning and Snowden.  31 December 2013 (South Dakota tax haven for the rich)  South Dakota is a tax haven for any rich person that sets up a trust there.  31 December 2013 (Thug sentenced to two years in prison for illegal anal searches)  Officer Vagnini, who committed illegal anal searches against a series of people, was sentenced to only two years in prison. That's not much of a sentence for a serial rapist. Meanwhile, the other thugs that supported his crime wave received very light sentences.  30 December 2013 (Federal judge rules that violation of 4th amendment is lawful)  A federal judge ruled that the NSA's collection of phone records is lawful.  This directly contradicts another judge who ruled it was an Orwellian violation of 4th amendment. Either or both could be overruled on appeal.  The reference to the September 2001 attacks is mistaken, because we know for a fact that phone surveillance would not have been necessary for preventing the attacks if the US government had been paying attention. The US government had various warnings, including the flight student that wasn't interested in learning to land the plane, but ignored them. Dubya had told the FBI to reduce the resources into counterterrorism.  It is also irrelevant as a reason. If the state were allowed to monitor everything and search everything, it could prevent many kinds of crimes, as well as many kinds of dissent and whistleblowing, but that doesn't invalidate the 4th amendment.  30 December 2013 (Cigarettes in plain paper packs encourage quitting)  Psychological evidence shows that plain paper packs, not covered by "cool" branding, make cigarettes less attractive and encourage quitting.  That is supported by a study in Australia which compared smokers that got plain packs with smokers using the same cigarette brands in attractive packs.  There is no direct evidence yet about whether it reduces cigarette consumption. That would take more time. However, it is unlikely to hurt.  30 December 2013 (The UK censorship filter)  The UK censorship filter blocks more than porn. It blocks access to sex education sites, even help-lines.  It also blocks many free software sites, and even amnesty.org.  These schemes always make mistakes, and this is proof that that continues to happen. But let's not be distracted by the mistakes. Even if they could fix all the mistakes, which they can't, that would not make censorship acceptable. Fixing 90% of the mistakes, which maybe they could do, would not make it acceptable either. Down with censorship and the tyrannical rulers that impose it!  30 December 2013 (Arrest of Al Jazeera correspondents in Egypt)  Al Jazeera correspondents in Egypt have been arrested for interviewing members of the Muslim Brotherhood.  When a government accuses someone of publishing "false news", or says it is illegal to interview someone because he's been declared a terrorist (or even convicted in a fair trial of a terrorist act), that's manifest tyranny.  The US-backed government of Yemen did something similar to Abdulelah Haidar Shaye, imprisoning him at Obama's request for interviewing people in al Qa'ida.  30 December 2013 (Resisting privatization of water systems)  Resisting and reversing the privatization of water systems.  30 December 2013 (TED)  TED is based on the assumption that all we need is a clever new idea.  30 December 2013 (SD cards have processors whose programs can be changed)  SD cards (and other memories) have processors whose programs can be changed.  If it is normal to change that software &mdash; for instance, if users are sometimes given upgrades &mdash; then it is an injustice that these programs are proprietary. However, even if it is not normal to change that software, this is a dangerous vulnerability to viruses, the NSA, etc.  30 December 2013 (Regulating prostitution to make prostitutes safer)  New Zealand offers an example of regulating prostitution that really does make prostitutes safer.  It seems to have worked out well there, based on anecdotes and official reports.  Meanwhile, the US keeps prostitution illegal and maintains a stigma against prostitutes, with predictable results.  29 December 2013 (Compensation for poor countries damaged by global heating)  As the damage of global heating on poor countries becomes increasingly large and irrefutable, the rich polluting countries will have to pay compensation.  29 December 2013 (Right wing gets Americans to curse gov't rather than recapture it)  Many Americans have been led to believe that the prime culprit of the financial crisis was the government, rather than the banksters.  The right wing strategy is, after each thing they do to hurt Americans, to get Americans to curse the government for it, rather than recapture the government and use it for democracy.  This article makes a common mistake in its rhetoric: it says that "we" have done some foolish thing, in a way that implies we have all participated in it. That's not only unfair, it is also defeatist.  29 December 2013 (The Dinka-Nuer conflict in South Sudan)  The background of the Dinka-Nuer conflict in South Sudan.  29 December 2013 (Obama keeps selling arms to Saudi Arabia)  Obama keeps selling arms to Saudi Arabia despite its repression of human rights activists.  29 December 2013 (The US drone program)  A drone combat analyst explains that the image is so fuzzy that they can't tell whether someone is armed.  29 December 2013 (Arrest of air passenger for carrying flash cards for learning Arabic)  A judge ruled that the FBI was allowed to arrest an air passenger for no reason other than carrying flash cards for learning Arabic.  Is studying Arabic more suspect than already knowing how to speak Arabic? If not, then how about arresting people only for knowing Arabic?  29 December 2013 (Egyptian thugs storm university)  Egyptian thugs stormed the country's main university, attacking students and burning a dormitory.  28 December 2013 (Ukraine's gov't cites the UK as an example of violating human rights)  Ukraine's government cites the UK as an example of violating human rights.  28 December 2013 (Chinese schools are designed for producing great test-takers)  Chinese schools are designed for producing great test-takers, which makes them look good when their students are judged by a standardized test, but lousy in other respects.  However, US "school reformers" seem bent on pushing US schools in that direction.  28 December 2013 (Iraq's Sunnis protesting for a year against Shi'ite-dominated Iraqi gov't)  Iraq's Sunnis have been protesting for a year against the Shi'ite-dominated Iraqi government. The state sent troops to arrest a protest leader, and his guards fought back.  I have no way of judging the claim that the protesters support al Qa'ida. It might be true. Al Qa'ida calls for wiping out the Shi'ites.  This unending sectarian war is Dubya's gift to Iraq. Ironically, Dubya found a way to wind it down: buying the support of the Sunni clans. But the money was cut off as the Bush forces left Iraq and the Shi'ites don't seem ready to employ it.  28 December 2013 (UK started charging non-citizens for births and antenatal care)  The UK has started charging non-citizens for births and antenatal care, so women who can't afford this give birth at home without aid.  The financial "savings" achieved this way will lead to bigger financial costs, as well as injuries and deaths. That's part of the goal: to accustom more people to poverty. Once this is the norm for immigrants, it will be applied to Britons.  28 December 2013 (Many internet sites are requiring commenters to identify themselves)  Many internet sites are requiring commenters to identify themselves.  I am happy to post comments under my name, but I can afford to because I am in a pretty safe position. I don't have to fear that I will be fired if my boss does not like what I say.  28 December 2013 (Turkish prosecutor says thugs interfered with the investigation)  Turkish prosecutor in charge of the corruption investigation says the thugs interfered with the investigation. Meanwhile, the ministry has removed him from the case.  28 December 2013 (If Snowden were tried in the US)  If Snowden were tried in the US, all evidence about the good he has done for the country, or intended to do, would be inadmissible.  28 December 2013 (Poor people in UK can no longer afford heating)  Poor people in the UK can no longer afford heating, so their walls are getting wet and moldy, which triggers asthma.  28 December 2013 (Almost 900 people died in US jails in 2011)  Almost 900 people died in US jails in 2011, often because the thugs in charge disregard their medical problems.  28 December 2013 (To exploit or be exploited)  Plutocracy leaves most Americans with two choices: to exploit or be exploited.  Even so, you can still campaign for progressives against the illegitimate plutocratic government.  28 December 2013 (Tracking of commercial e-book users)  Some of the things that e-book stores have learned by tracking the suckers that use commercial e-books.  Don't be a sucker &mdash; reject these malicious products. Insist on using only e-books that respect your freedom as much as ordinary printed books.  27 December 2013 (Persian exile accuses West of supporting Khomeini's return)  A Persian exile accuses the West of supporting Khomeini's return to Iran and his plan to establish a fundamentalist regime.  I don't know that this is true. I would like to see proof.  27 December 2013 (Yasser Arafat)  The French and Russian teams that examined Yasser Arafat's remains say he was not poisoned with polonium-210. These reports contradict the findings of the Swiss team.  The French team found polonium-210 and said it was of "natural origin", which does not make sense, as polonium is exceedingly rare and found only in uranium ore.  27 December 2013 (Ten states ban paid sick days)  Ten States Have Banned Cities And Counties From Passing Paid Sick Days.  27 December 2013 (Los Angeles thugs)  LA thugs' latest power trip is against pedestrians.  27 December 2013 (Global Heating) Global heating is causing scarcity  of water and food.  27 December 2013 (Nuclear Arsenal) Maintaining Nuclear Arsenal To Cost $355 Billion (over 10 years, but still it is a ridiculous waste).  27 December 2013 (Ukrainian journalist maimed)  A journalist in Ukraine was pulled out of her car and maimed by unknown men after accusing a minister of corruption.  That minister is probably in charge of the thugs, and people accuse him of sending thugs to carry out this attack.  26 December 2013 (Pharmaceutical Extortion: Pay Up, or Die)  Pharmaceutical Extortion: Pay Up, or Die.  The root of this injustice is patent law, combined with the failure of the US to do what other advanced governments do: directly negotiate the price of pharmaceuticals.  In addition, all countries must remove the funding of studies of drug effects from the hands of the drug companies, since they corrupt the results.  26 December 2013 (The fossil fuel agenda)  The fossil fuel agenda is anti-business (as well as anti-civilization and anti-your-survival).  I hope that this argument wins some support, but the fact that it even needs to be made demonstrates a fundamental flaw in our current political system: plutocracy, the political power of business.  It's due to plutocracy that the fossil fuel companies have the power to keep humanity stuck on the path to global heating disaster. Why do Republicans in Congress deny global heating and its effects? It's due to fossil fuel money.  That's not the only area in which plutocracy oppresses us. Plutocracy is why governments propose laws like SOPA. Plutocracy is why the US government proposes to let poultry producers inspect their own products. Plutocracy is why the US government doesn't label GMOs. Plutocracy is how the banksters abolished the Glass-Steagall Act and then fraudulently take many Americans' homes and get off scot-free because they are "too big to jail."  And they are planning treaties to give them increased power.  It makes sense to appeal to these illegitimate powers to see when their interests are threatened by something that threatens us too. But we must take care, when doing this, not to grant any legitimacy to their rule. We need to replace plutocracy with democracy.  26 December 2013 (De Blasio selects Goldman Sachs executive as deputy mayor)  Troubling Pattern as De Blasio Taps Goldman Sachs Exec.  26 December 2013 (Eviction of Haitians in shantytown with no help or place to go)  Haitians in a shantytown are being evicted with no help or place to go.  They moved to that shantytown after their homes were destroyed in the earthquake after which large amounts of "aid" from wealthy countries were offered but put into preparing sweatshops rather than helping homeless Haitians.  26 December 2013 (Swarthmore Hillel rejects ban on speakers that criticize Israeli policy)  The Swarthmore Hillel society has rejected the parent organization's ban on speakers that criticize Israeli policy.  This in response to Harvard Hillel's cancellation of a speech by a former Israeli parliamentarian who criticizes Israeli policy.  26 December 2013 (Israel arrests leader of nonviolent protests)  Israel arrested the leader of nonviolent protests in Kafr Qaddum.  26 December 2013 (How lead got put into gasoline)  How lead got put into gasoline: a series of corrupt influences led to nationwide suffering.  26 December 2013 (Egyptian gov't declares Muslim Brotherhood a "terrorist group")  The Egyptian government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a "terrorist group", an excuse to say every member is a criminal.  Declaring groups "terrorist" without a trial is a gross violation of human rights. The US must cease this practice to set an example of respect for human rights; if it does not, other countries such as Egypt will surely take inspiration from the US' bad example.  26 December 2013 (Prisoners in Bagram have no right to habeas corpus)  A US court ruled that prisoners in Bagram in Afghanistan have no right to habeas corpus.  It is legitimate to capture enemy soldiers and hold them as prisoners of war. (If this were not allowed, prisoners would instead be shot.) Being a prisoner of war is not punishment for a crime, and no trial is needed. Of course, prisoners of war do have rights, and torture violates them.  However, the 2010 decision, about people kidnaped in other countries where the US was not at war, and then transported to Afghanistan just to hold them in prison, was wrong. Those cases are exactly like Guantanamo.  25 December 2013 (Urgent: Oppose bill that sabotages diplomacy with Iran)  US citizens: Call on Senator Sherrod Brown not to support the bill to sabotage diplomacy with Iran.  25 December 2013 (Obama appears to be planning to sell out his country)  After pressure, Obama allowed congresscritters to look at the text &mdash; without staff to help them understand the implications &mdash; but they can't tell us what they saw.  The only plausible reason to negotiate a treaty like this is that Obama is planning to sell out his country, like Dubya before him.  25 December 2013 (Stories from Americans hit by cuts in food stamps)  Americans hit by cuts in food stamps tell their stories.  25 December 2013 (Snowden has no "insurance packet")  Snowden says that he did not set up an "insurance packet" for release if he is killed, since that might have tempted various entities to kill him so as to cause that data to be released.  25 December 2013 (Computer manufacturers keeping repair manuals secret)  Many computer manufacturers have adopted a new way of subjugating users: keeping the repair manuals secret.  Unfortunately, the iFixit manuals are not free. The article says they are, but it means they are gratis. I tried to convince Kyle Wiens to release them under a free license, but failed. I hope he will change his mind.  25 December 2013 (Turkish thugs torture man mistaken for a protester)  Hakan Yaman was tortured by Turkish thugs who mistook him for a protester. (Not that it would have been justified to torture a real protester.) They gouged out an eye and threw him in a fire: attempted premeditated murder.  The government is has been unable to find the thugs who were responsible. Perhaps it has not tried very hard.  This case is among the most extreme, among the general repression of the protesters.  25 December 2013 (Palestinians with cancer denied access to medical treatment)  The Israeli siege includes denying Palestinians with cancer access to medical treatment, like a cat toying with mice.  25 December 2013 (Israel and US insist on continuing occupation of 1/4 of West Bank)  The European Union is trying to pressure Israel and Palestine to make peace, but Israel and the US insist on a continuing occupation of 1/4 of the West Bank, which would give Israel control over Palestinian travel and commerce.  25 December 2013 (Israeli troops ransack family's house and steal 5 years of savings)  An everyday war crime in Palestine: Israeli troops ransacked a Palestinian family's house and stole 5 years of savings.  25 December 2013 (US Export-Import Bank to fund project likely to damage environment)  The US Export-Import Bank is planning to fund a project in Australia that is likely to damage the surrounding environment, but the environmental impact study ducked the question.  24 December 2013 (Urgent: Systematic anti-trafficking policies in Scotland)  Everyone: encourage the proposal for systematic anti-trafficking policies in Scotland.  24 December 2013 (CIA helping Colombian gov't kill and torture FARC members)  The CIA is helping the Colombian government kill and torture FARC members.  The FARC is a rebel group which has also financed itself through drug trafficking and kidnaping. However, the most vicious terrorist group in Colombia is the paramilitaries that are linked with the state.  24 December 2013 (Teenagers fleeing Central American to the US)  Teenagers are fleeing Central America to the US because they are threatened with conscription into criminal gangs.  The War on Drugs seems to be ultimately at fault.  24 December 2013 (Former BP geologist says Peak Oil reached)  A former BP geologist says that we have reached Peak Oil, and that the rate of oil extraction will decline from now on.  Whether this is a bad thing depends on how humanity reacts to it. The high price of oil reduces demand: Americans drive less, nowadays, than they did when oil was cheaper. The high price of oil encourages investment in other energy sources &mdash; some renewable (solar, wind, geothermal) and some polluting (coal, fracking, nuclear).  If only our governments pushed for renewable energy rather than polluting energy.  We could use a lot less energy for heating and for transport if we pushed harder to achieve that. Amory Lovins showed years ago that a small fraction of what we now use could do the job. And mass transit uses a lot less energy than travel by car.  The extent of economic inequality in the US is so great that our main need is not increased production of things, but rather a way for everyone to get a share. If the US produced only half as much, we would get along ok if the poor got a bigger share.  24 December 2013 (Violent Islamists in Egypt bomb municipal thug office)  Violent Islamists in Egypt carried out a car bombing against a municipal thug office. There have been a series of such attacks.  It is clear that they are inspired by the violent suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood.  24 December 2013 (Netanyahu admits he does not want peace with Palestine)  Extra, extra! Netanyahu admits he doesn't want peace with Palestine!  He did not say it in so many words, but that's the inescapable implication. For Israel to demand release of an American who spied for Israel &mdash; or any other unrelated concession &mdash; says, "Peace isn't something we seek, just something we might do for the US in exchange for something we want."  24 December 2013 (Israel kills children in Gaza in retaliation for shooting)  Palestinians shot an Israeli who was working on the fence around Gaza, so Israel retaliated with bombs, killing children in Gaza.  Although the Israeli who was shot was not a soldier, he was doing a job that is not entirely civilian in nature, like the Iranian nuclear scientists that Israel killed a few years ago. The Palestinian children, by contrast, were simply being children.  24 December 2013 (Millions of American families hungry during the holidays)  Millions of American families received a Christmas gift from Congress: hunger.  24 December 2013 (Changes proposed by Obama's NSA review panel far from sufficient)  Snowden says that Obama's NSA review panel proposed "cosmetic" changes.  I think they might be slightly more than cosmetic, but they are far from sufficient. In this interview, Snowden explains what he thinks is needed.  What I think is needed is to redesign digital systems so that they don't amass data about users in general.  24 December 2013 (Supporters of Israel's occupation pressuring US universities)  Supporters of Israel's occupation of Palestine are pressuring US universities to boycott the American Studies Association. Meanwhile, members of the association are receiving hate mail.  This demonstrates the courage required in the US today to oppose that pressure group.  I am sure the ASA will not yield to this pressure, but what happens to the ASA will influence others. Thus, it is important to urge universities not to cease their support for the ASA.  24 December 2013 (Pardoning Alan Turing alone is not enough)  Pardoning Alan Turing and him alone is not enough: 75,000 Britons were convicted of homosexuality, and they all deserve the same apology.  If the UK wants to deserve a pardon, it needs to go further.  24 December 2013 (Australia approves destruction of wildlife reserve)  Australia has approved a coal mine that will destroy a wildlife reserve, replacing it with "offsets" that are just an excuse to proceed.  24 December 2013 (Obama may be operating under fear of threats from CIA)  Obama may be operating under fear of threats from the CIA.  The appointment of Dulles to the Warren Commission is extremely suspect because there is no other plausible reason for it except to enable him to cover things up.  24 December 2013 (Miami and LA sue big banks for racism)  Miami and Los Angeles have sued big banks for racism in application of subprime mortgages.  24 December 2013 (Republican gov'ts in 23 states block extension of Medicaid)  Republican governments in 23 states have blocked Obama's extension of Medicaid, which will leave around 5 million Americans without health care.  24 December 2013 (Afghanistan imposing biometric ID cards)  Afghanistan is imposing biometric ID cards.  As a temporary measure for the war with the Taliban, they could be excuses. Such circumstances justify measures that normally must be condemned. But they will surely be meant as permanent.  24 December 2013 (Time to Make the Fed a Public Utility)  100 Years Is Enough: Time to Make the Fed a Public Utility.  24 December 2013 (Rosewood in Madagascar nearly wiped out by illegal logging)  Rosewood in Madagascar has been nearly wiped out by illegal logging, while the government hardly bothers to intervene.  24 December 2013 (Assad's air force is bombarding civilians with shrapnel bombs)  Assad's air force is bombarding civilians with shrapnel bombs.  24 December 2013 (Campaign for humane treatment of prisoners in Russia)  The two members of Pussy Riot just freed will launch a campaign for humane treatment of prisoners in Russia.  This is good, but as an American I wish they would extend their campaign to aid prisoners in the US.  They also called Putin's amnesty, which led to their release, a "PR move".  24 December 2013 (Absence in the Bay of Fundy of right whales)  The absence in the Bay of Fundy of right whales may be due to global heating.  24 December 2013 (Senator Warren's opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline)  Senator Warren's opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline shines a light on Clinton's support for it.  24 December 2013 (RSA Inc responded to disclosure of its secret contract with NSA)  RSA Inc responded to the disclosure of its secret contract with the NSA with a cunningly worded announcement that appears to say it wasn't true. However, a careful reading shows it doesn't really say that.  24 December 2013 (When cooking food in US prisons was privatized)  When cooking food in US prisons was privatized, Aramark started serving food that is spoiled or unfit for human consumption, prepared in unsanitary conditions.  The only way such a company can make a profit is by mistreating someone.  24 December 2013 (Long-Term unemployment is a disaster)  Unemployment is painful, but long-term unemployment is a disaster.  24 December 2013 ("Open carry" of guns is asking for trouble)  "Open carry" of guns is asking for trouble, because just seeing guns causes fear and encourage aggression.  24 December 2013 (Debt costs the Philippines far more than typhoon Haiyan)  Debt costs the Philippines far more than typhoon Haiyan. Many of these loans represent the corruption. The "aid" for rebuilding often consists of more loans.  The Philippines should decide that these loans were predatory and therefore don't have to be repaid. The predatory lenders should be taught a lesson by losing their money.  24 December 2013 (The record companies' manipulation)  While rich celebrity musicians spread a weak form of feminism, other musicians have rejected the record companies' manipulation.  24 December 2013 (Anti-Austerity movement at the European level)  Calling for an anti-austerity movement at the European level.  24 December 2013 (French companies fined for paying women less than men)  French companies are being fined for paying women less than men.  Hear, hear!  23 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on Chick-fil-A to stop harassing artist)  Everyone: call on Chick-fil-A to stop harassing the artist that makes "Eat more Kale" shirts.  23 December 2013 (Urgent: Eliminate NFL tax exemption)  Everyone: call for elimination of the National Football League's tax-exemption.  Here is the background.  23 December 2013 (New style of apology from politicians who get caught)  The new style of apology from a politician that gets caught.  23 December 2013 (Canned voice recordings used by telemarketers)  Many telemarketer calls use canned voice recordings, and a human selects which response to give next.  I don't see telemarketing as particularly bad, just wasteful and annoying. I have never bought anything from a telemarketer, and I don't let the call go on for more than a few seconds, because I don't want to spend my time on them.  It is useful to train yourself out of applying normal ideas of politeness &mdash; for instance, that it is rude to hang up on someone &mdash; to a commercially-motivated call from a stranger.  I think it might be good to legally require telemarketing calls to start by playing a recording that says, "Stay on the line if you wish to talk with a telemarketer."  23 December 2013 (Mariah Carey entertaining a dictator again)  Mariah Carey is entertaining a dictator again.  23 December 2013 (Protest leaders that brought down Mubarak sentenced to prison)  Leaders of the protests that brought down Mubarak have been sentenced to 3 years in prison.  23 December 2013 (Customer anonymity)  The Consumer Finance Protection Board receives anonimized credit card purchase data from a company; that company gets it with names, which might facilitate misuse of the data.  Of course, the underlying problem is that the banks and the stores get to identify their customers when they pay by credit card. Thus, it is better to use an ATM to withdraw money and pay cash.  23 December 2013 (FDA action on antibiotics on farms inadequate)  FDA action on antibiotics on farms is inadequate.  23 December 2013 (Authorities try to stop student from delivering speech)  A Florida student was denied his prize for a speech, when authorities discovered his speech was about injustice in the name of religion.  23 December 2013 (US pharmacists give teenagers false information)  US pharmacists frequently give teenagers false information telling them that they are not allowed to buy emergency contraception.  23 December 2013 (Treating drug problems instead of punishing them)  Obama's health care program could be an opportunity to move towards treating drug problems instead of punishing them.  23 December 2013 (Obama regime pretends what Snowden told us is still secret)  The Obama regime pretends that what Snowden told us is still secret, and had the chutzpah to tell a judge that there's no proof the NSA is spying on everyone.  23 December 2013 (Surveillance cameras with audio recording on buses &amp; trains)  Surveillance cameras which record audio are being put on buses &amp; trains.  The TSA is funding this.  Here are the specs on some bus camera and microphone systems.  There is no possible excuse for microphones in buses. The arguments in favor are arguments for listening to everyone everywhere.  It's not just the NSA. These systems must be removed and banned.  23 December 2013 (States with more guns have higher murder rates)  A study found that states with more guns have higher murder rates, and the two rates vary together over time.  23 December 2013 (Obama's review of the NSA insufficient)  Obama's review of the NSA called for substantial changes.  However, they involved limiting government access to dossiers, not limiting the accumulation of dossiers, and this can't be sufficient.  23 December 2013 (Chinese communist party desperately tries reform and censorship)  The Chinese communist party desperately tries reform and censorship.  23 December 2013 (Domestic violence in England)  A study in which researchers interviewed people at home found that the rate of domestic violence in England is substantially more than was known. Many are afraid to tell anyone what is happening to them.  23 December 2013 (Living conditions of migrant workers in Abu Dhabi)  Report on the living conditions of migrant workers in Abu Dhabi.  Some individual stories.  Allowing an employer to hold a worker's passport is the gateway to abuse.  22 December 2013 (Urgent Oppose bill to punish gays even worse in Uganda)  Everyone: call on Uganda's president to veto the bill to punish gays even worse.  More about this law.  22 December 2013 (Urgent: Forceful action against feeding antibiotics to farm animals)  US citizens: tell the FDA we need forceful action against feeding antibiotics to farm animals other than to treat infections.  22 December 2013 (Flaw in Obama's health care law)  One flaw in Obama's health care law is that, for many people in the lower middle class, it doesn't make health care affordable.  This is no surprise, however. The law was designed to offer medical coverage to many of the uninsured poor, while catering to medical insurance companies. To reduce costs for others would have required the public option and big savings would have required a single payer plan.  22 December 2013 (Catholic school students protest dismissal of teacher)  Catholic school students in Seattle went on strike to protest the dismissal of a teacher because he had entered a same-sex marriage.  22 December 2013 (Raw data from scientific research)  Scientific journals must start insisting that authors provide the raw data, so it does not get lost.  22 December 2013 (Obama commutes crack cocaine sentences)  8 Down, Thousands To Go After Obama Commutes 'Unfair' Crack Cocaine Sentences.  22 December 2013 (Self-censorship due to NSA surveillance)  Many writers self-censor for fear of NSA surveillance.  22 December 2013 (Ensuring that chemical products are not toxic)  Proper government regulation could ensure that chemical products are not toxic.  22 December 2013 (US govt aims to radically advance facial recognition software)  The US government is aiming to radically advance facial recognition software.  If that is used against journalists and protesters, it will be curtains for democracy.  22 December 2013 (Renault Zoe forces car owners to "rent" remote-controlled battery)  The Renault Zoe forces the owner to "rent" a battery which can be turned off remotely.  As usual, the EFF advocates a remedy which doesn't go far enough. It's not enough to make it legal for car owners to defeat these vicious schemes. The schemes themselves should be illegal, period.  22 December 2013 (The loophole used by NSA to search Americans' communications)  Explaining the loophole the NSA uses to search Americans' communications while "not targeting Americans".  The article advocates the USA FREEDOM Act, which would limit the government's right to access digital dossiers. This would be a step forward, but nowhere near enough.  22 December 2013 (Anti-democracy protesters in Thailand boycott election)  The anti-democracy protesters of Thailand's "Democratic Party" decided to boycott the coming election, which they know they would lose.  22 December 2013 (Five Ways to Curb Your Child's Materialism)  Five Ways to Curb Your Child's Materialism This Holiday Season.  22 December 2013 (US student activism)  US student activism against racism and various forms of oppression.  22 December 2013 (Morsi trial)  Morsi now faces absurd charges of conspiring with Hamas and Hezbollah.  The Muslim Brotherhood is a Sunni theocratist group. Hezbollah is a Shi'ite group, militant but more concerned with defending Shi'ites' political interests than with religion. The idea that they would work together is as ridiculous as the idea that Saddam Hussein and al Qa'ida would work together &mdash; but Dubya found it useful to claim they did.  As for the charges of escaping from prison, at that time state agents went around arresting (and sometimes killing) people for political reasons. Zero-tolerance for escapes, and immunity for the captors, is hardly justice.  22 December 2013 (Kansas restricts speech by professors in state universities)  Kansas says state universities can fire professors for saying anything the university administration says is "contrary to the best interest of the university".  22 December 2013 (Woman in Texas subjected to medical procedures without consent)  A woman is suing because thugs in Texas subjected her to medical procedures including X-rays, without her consent. Then the hospital tried to make her pay for $5000 for this.  22 December 2013 (Oakland installs surveillance system to suppress protests)  Oakland installed a combined surveillance system, supposedly to fight "crime", but its operators were only interested in suppressing protests.  The ACLU is making a mistake by using timid words like "troubling" to describe this. This surveillance is un-American tyranny, and any the community should demand shutting it down.  22 December 2013 (Thugs awarded for thuggish activity in the US)  Awards for the most thuggish thug activity in the US.  22 December 2013 (UK's internet censorship scheme blocks sex education sites)  The UK's internet censorship scheme blocks sex education sites and sites that help rape victims.  Maybe these are mistakes, but every such censorship scheme makes such mistakes.  22 December 2013 (Anti-pipeline protesters charged with "terrorist hoax")  Anti-pipeline protesters displayed a banner, and some glitter fell off it, so the thugs charged them with a "terrorist hoax".  TransCanada, the company that wants to build the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline, is working with local thug departments and encouraging them to accuse nonviolent protesters of "terrorism".  We need to pass a law making it a crime for officials to make absurd charges against anyone.  22 December 2013 (Shaker Aamer on book censorship in Guantanamo)  Shaker Aamer gently ridicules the inexplicable book censorship of the Guantanamo prison guards.  A recently freed ex-prisoner says the prisoners were subjected to "meticulous, daily torture".  21 December 2013 (NSA paid RSA Inc. to make the NSA's ineffective key generator the default option)  A Snowden document says that the NSA paid RSA Inc. to make the NSA's ineffective key generator the default option.  More information.  If the program is not free, its users are defenseless against malice at all sorts of levels.  21 December 2013 (What US TV said when the US bombed a wedding party in Yemen)  Imagine what TV would say if someone bombed a wedding party in the US; now contrast that with what US TV said when the US bombed a wedding party in Yemen.  A Murdoch paper made a joke out of it.  21 December 2013 (Israel puts African refugees in a sort of prison)  Uri Avnery: Israel puts African refugees in a sort of prison which it pretends is not a prison.  It reminds him of how other countries treated Jewish refugees trying to flee from Nazism.  In the long term, the way to end mass migration for economic motives is to end the wealth-concentrating policies that keep most people poor.  21 December 2013 (.9 billion to organizations campaigning to continue global heating)  Organizations campaigning to continue global heating received .9 billion dollars a year in funding over the past 8 years.  Not all of that money was used to promote global heating; it is not possible in some cases to separate out what was spent on that and what was spent on other right-wing causes.  21 December 2013 (Americans whose health insurance plans were canceled will not be fined if they don't get new plans)  Americans whose health insurance plans were recently canceled will not be fined if they don't get new plans.  Obama's health care plan is, overall, a step forward, and this flexibility is welcome. But it does cost some people substantial money because it was designed to cater to the insurance companies  and the drug companies.  21 December 2013 (US economy is not "back on track")  The US economy is not "back on track" to give most Americans a decent life.  21 December 2013 (NSA and GCHQ spied on Unicef and M&eacute;decins du Monde)  The NSA and GCHQ spied on Unicef and M&eacute;decins du Monde, in addition to European officials.  21 December 2013 (Oil and highways mean destroying the forest after poisoning the people)  In the Colombian Amazon, oil and highways mean destroying the forest after poisoning the people.  The Nukak people lived in the forest by themselves, until their forest was cut down for coca plantations.  21 December 2013 (UK judge quashed Libyan dissident Belhaj's lawsuit)  A UK judge quashed Libyan dissident Belhaj's lawsuit, saying that the he had a valid case against the UK for handing him to Gaddafi's men, but that this was unimportant compared with sucking up to the US.  21 December 2013 (A former prosecutor couldn't get NYC thugs to arrest him)  A former prosecutor found that he couldn't get NYC thugs to arrest him for minor crimes, apparently because he's white. They just ignored his crimes.  Once he finally got himself arrested, for spray-painting on city hall, the prosecutors demanded outrageous and unusual punishments, even violating standard penal policies, apparently out of pure spite.  21 December 2013 (Tax meat)  Tax meat to discourage its global heating contribution.  Most Americans would live longer if they ate less meat.  21 December 2013 (Urgent: Do not build a coal port near the Great Barrier Reef)  Everyone: call on Lend Lease not to build a coal port near the Great Barrier Reef.  21 December 2013 (Jesus & Mo t-shirts do not have to be censored)  The London School of Economics has concluded that Jesus & Mo t-shirts do not have to be censored.  UK law goes too far in prohibiting expressions of opinion. If it is even plausible that pictures of Mohammad are illegal on the grounds that someone might take offense, freedom of speech is too weak.  21 December 2013 (New York City residents are hurt by Obama's health care program)  New York City residents are paradoxically hurt by Obama's health care program because they have a much better program available from the city.  21 December 2013 (Some Republicans asked for investigating Clapper for lying to Congress)  Some Republicans in the House of Representatives asked for investigating Clapper for lying to Congress.  I support this call. He deserves to go to jail.  21 December 2013 (Democratic Senators looking for a way to block diplomacy with Iran)  Democratic Senators are again looking for a way to block diplomacy with Iran.  21 December 2013 (Uganda adopted law punishing homosexuality with life imprisonment)  Uganda has adopted a law punishing homosexuality with life imprisonment.  Like many other unjust laws and policies, this one is supposedly "to protect children".  21 December 2013 (Atrocious conditions refugees are subject to)  Doctors sent by Australia to treat the imprisoned refugees on Christmas Island describe the atrocious conditions the refugees are subject to.  21 December 2013 (West must not ignore message that its wars stir up hatred)  The West must not ignore the repeated messages that its wars stir up hatred.  There are two ways to consider terrorist attacks such as those in New York in 2001 and in London in 2005: as crimes or as war.  To consider them as crimes means responding by hunting and prosecuting the perpetrators &mdash; not by launching wars. If we view the issue in terms of crime, the attack on Rigby was a crime too and prosecuting its perpetrators was legitimate. However, invading Iraq was not legitimate and we have a duty to prosecute those responsible.  On the other hand, if we consider those terrorist attacks as war and say they justify war in response, the enemy can say the same. Viewed as war, the killing of Rigby was an attack by a guerrilla force on a military target. The US has committed plenty of war crimes, and so have the Taliban and its supporters, but attacking Rigby wasn't one.  We can't have it both ways.  21 December 2013 (South Sudan is being torn apart by tribalism)  South Sudan is being torn apart by tribalism.  21 December 2013 (Mother writes about joining anti-fracking protest)  A mother writes about joining an anti-fracking protest because of the threat to her children's lives from future global heating.  If you are a young person today, there is considerable danger you will be killed by global heating &mdash; not soon, of course, but when it reaches the point where millions are starving, and fighting over food, globalized supply chains could break down, which would make a lot of technology and industry stop working world-wide.  We can't predict what will happen, as there are too many imponderables. Maybe some lucky surprise will avert the disaster, but do you want to bet your life on that? If we are to avoid it, we have to curb the greenhouse gas emission now.  21 December 2013 (Belgium requires ISPs to find and censor Pirate Bay mirrors)  Belgium requires ISPs to actively seek out mirrors of the Pirate Bay and censor access to them.  In other words, it is copyright uber alles.  21 December 2013 (Iraqis believe gov't responsible for violence attributed to al Qa'ida)  Iraqis believe that their government, set up by the US, is responsible for a lot of the violence that the government attributes to al Qa'ida.  21 December 2013 (Internet giants' opposition to surveillance)  The Internet Giants Oppose Surveillance&mdash; But Only When the Government Does It.  21 December 2013 (FCC doesn't bother making TV stations say who pays for ads)  The FCC could make TV stations say who pays for the ads but it doesn't bother.  21 December 2013 (UK gov't kills all followup for Gibson report)  Although the UK government has effectively killed all followup for the Gibson report, the report is enough to prove plenty of wrongdoing.  21 December 2013 (20 years of NAFTA)  20 years of NAFTA shows the harm that "free trade" treaties do.  The plutocrats are not satisfied; they want even more.  21 December 2013 (The NDAA)  This year's NDAA makes progress on two issues: prosecution of rapists in the military, and releasing prisoners from Guantanamo.  Can anyone find out what has happened with the most un-American part of the NDAA, the provision that allows the military to imprison anyone without trial if the person is accused of being a "terrorist"?  21 December 2013 (Netanyahu's "security concerns" obsolete and irrelevant)  Uri Avnery: Netanyahu's "security concerns" about the Jordan valley are obsolete and militarily irrelevant; their only purpose is to provide an excuse not to make peace.  If Kerry could satisfy Netanyahu on this issue, Netanyahu would fall back on the next excuse.  21 December 2013 (Restrictions on prostitution ruled unconstitutional in Canada)  Canada's Supreme Court has ruled that restrictions on prostitution are unconstitutional.  21 December 2013 (Israeli soldiers demolish Palestinians shacks during blizzard)  In the midst of a blizzard, Israeli soldiers are demolishing the shacks and tents Palestinians live in.  21 December 2013 (Donkey carts used in Gaza due to lack of fuel)  In Gaza, donkey carts are used to pick up rubbish, because there is no fuel for garbage trucks, or even for pumping water.  21 December 2013 (Israeli soldiers shackle Palestinian children)  Israeli soldiers shackled Palestinian children aged 6 to 9 who were playing with burning tires and asbestos.  Burning tires makes fumes, and I suspect breathing them is not good for children. Asbestos is quite toxic. However, that was no reason to shackle the children.  21 December 2013 (No Australian coast guard vessel sent to monitor whaling fleet)  The Australian government has disregarded its previous commitment to send a coast guard vessel to monitor the Japanese whaling fleet.  21 December 2013 (The commercial version of Christmas)  Christian extremists say that secularists are fighting a "war on Christmas", but the real War on Christmas is the one waged by business.  Speaking as a secularist, I am not fighting a war on Christmas. I have no conflict with what Christians do for Christmas, as long as they don't try to get the government to promote their religion above my nonreligion.  What I strongly resent is the commercial version of Christmas, which  blares out at me in every store.  21 December 2013 (People who get trafficked into the UK get prosecuted rather than helped)  People who get trafficked into the UK and then forced into growing marijuana get prosecuted rather than helped.  This particular problem is ultimately the state's fault, since the right approach to growing marijuana is to legalize it. However, that would not eliminate the issue of trafficking; that needs to be addressed by itself.  21 December 2013 (Mikhail Khodorkovsky has been pardoned)  Mikhail Khodorkovsky, plutocrat turned political prisoner, has been pardoned.  21 December 2013 (Civil courts can handle captured terrorists)  The Warsame case shows that civil courts can handle captured terrorists.  The ACLU approves of his prosecution, but criticizes holding Warsame prisoner in a navy ship.  21 December 2013 (Most Americans say it was a mistake to invade Afghanistan)  A poll finds most Americans say it was a mistake to invade Afghanistan and want US troops removed faster.  I am not sure it was a mistake. The results were good in the beginning, and if Bush had not invaded Iraq, perhaps things would have turned out well in Afghanistan.  However, things are totally screwed now in Afghanistan and the US is not achieving much by keeping the fighting going.  21 December 2013 (Obama boasts about increasing extraction of fossil fuels)  Obama boasts about increasing extraction of fossil fuels.  21 December 2013 (Weak recommendations of Obama's review of NSA massive surveillance)  The EFF criticizes the weak recommendations of Obama's review of NSA massive surveillance.v  To make democracy safe, we must put an end to the massive accumulation of data about Americans.  21 December 2013 (The idea of childhood has been swept away by fear)  "Zero tolerance" means the idea of childhood has been swept away by fear.  The first step toward obsessive fear was when parents started thinking that children could never be left alone. I remember how happy I was, when I was 8 or so, during those periods when I was home and I could read without being annoyed by my mother.  Meanwhile, no one freaked out about the fact that I, and the other students in my school, walked to school and back on the sidewalks of Manhattan.  21 December 2013 (UK agents were directed to help cover up US kidnapings and torture)  The Gibson report says that UK agents were directed to help cover up US kidnapings and torture.  21 December 2013 (Islamists in Syria are practicing their usual cruelness)  The Islamists that have taken control of parts of Syria are practicing their usual cruelness, flogging and executing adults and teenagers after cursory "trials".  I don't see any feasible way to dislodge them.  21 December 2013 (Engineer at the Big Spill was convicted)  An engineer at the Big Spill was convicted of obstruction of justice for deleting messages in which the spill rate was estimated.  21 December 2013 (Urgent: Reject the proposed Monsanto GMO seed factory)  Everyone: urge Argentina to reject the proposed Monsanto GMO seed factory.  21 December 2013 (Urgent: Increase Social Security and rebuke Republican hostage-taking)  US citizens: call for increasing Social Security and rebuke Republican hostage-taking.  21 December 2013 (Urgent: Cancel the review of the Keystone XL pipeline by ERM)  US citizens: call on Kerry to cancel the review of the Keystone XL pipeline by ERM, which has been found in even more conflict of interest.  21 December 2013 (High speed trains in Europe are expensive)  High speed trains in Europe are so expensive that, for long distances, they push most travelers to flying.  I general prefer to travel by train if it is feasible, partly because I don't have to identify myself, and also partly because, with my luggage, "low-cost" airlines are not cheap.  21 December 2013 (The C+= language project)  The C+= language project, a funny parody of the form of speech of some feminists, is getting kicked off various web platforms in an act of political censorship.  Later I was told that BitBucket had deleted it too.  Equal rights and equal pay, regardless of gender, are causes I support. I've condemned patriarchy and proposed a way to make Spanish gender-neutral.  I also support satire, even satire of causes I support.  I will not support censorship.  21 December 2013 (Trashing human rights in Australia)  Trashing human rights is everyday practice in Australia.  21 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on bankers to give bonuses to people they made homeless)  Everyone: call on banksters to give their holiday bonuses to the people they made homeless.  21 December 2013 (The world may be hitting Peak Food)  The world may be hitting Peak Food.  The human race needs to hit Peak Population soon, or we're asking for trouble.  21 December 2013 (Why Taser Is Paying Millions in Secret 'Suspect Injury Or Death' Settlements)  Why Taser Is Paying Millions in Secret 'Suspect Injury Or Death' Settlements. When Does "Less Lethal" Actually Mean "Deadly"?  Being tased is surely less dangerous than being hit with a bullet. If we think of tasing as a substitute for shooting, tasing probably results in less harm. But if tasers encourage people to shoot, on the basis that they are safe, tasers could result in more harm.  21 December 2013 (Law to criminalize suggesting that public employees go on strike)  Alberta is considering a law to criminalize suggesting that public employees go on strike.  21 December 2013 (South Korea bans all publications from North Korea)  South Korea bans all publications from North Korea, and even access to a site that analyzes North Korea's internet presence. (See last paragraph.)  21 December 2013 (Bill that is supposed to regulate lobbying in the UK)  A bill that is supposed to regulate lobbying in the UK will tie up citizens' campaigns in red tape.  I suspect the problem is due to not distinguishing business funding from other funding.  21 December 2013 (Edward Felten analyzes strained language that Obama's NSA report uses)  Edward Felten analyzes the strained language that Obama's NSA report uses to give the impression that the NSA has not put back doors into software people use. If the statements are literally true, they are full of loopholes.  They might also be false. If the NSA officials will lie to Congress, why wouldn't they lie to us?  21 December 2013 (The FBI also snoops on Americans unjustly)  It's not just the NSA: the FBI also snoops on Americans unjustly.  20 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on Obama to grant Snowden immunity)  US citizens: call on Obama to grant Snowden immunity.  20 December 2013 (Volcker Rule Made Meaningless by Abundant Exemptions)  Volcker Rule Made Meaningless by Abundant Exemptions.  20 December 2013 (The political dominance of business in Asia)  Three different disasters in Asia come from the same cause: the political dominance of business.  To change this, we should abolish the institutions such as the WTO that cement their power.  20 December 2013 (UK gov't won't allow investigation of Alexander Litvinenko's death)  The coroner in charge of investigating the death of Alexander Litvinenko says that the government won't allow him to investigate properly whether Russian agents murdered Litvinenko.  If someone were accused of the murder, that person would deserve a fair trial, being considered innocent until proven guilty. However, for these political purposes, we can presume the Russian state is guilty.  20 December 2013 (Prostitutes in China sentenced to labor camps, used for profit)  In China, prostitutes are sentenced to labor camps that use them for profit.  20 December 2013 (US official says US officials lie all the time)  A US official in Vietnam told journalists not to believe anything US officials say, because they lie all the time.  20 December 2013 (Catholic hospitals' claim that they serve the poor)  Catholic hospitals in the US try to excuse their contempt for women's rights by claiming that they serve the poor. Not very true nowadays.  20 December 2013 (Maoist dissidents killing perpetrators of pogrom against Dalits)  The Indian state has not punished the perpetrators of a pogrom against Dalits, so the Maoist dissidents are killing them.  Buddhism in India, by Gail Omvedt, argues that Dalits are the descendants of India's Buddhists, from the time when the nobles suppressed Buddhism.  20 December 2013 (Aborted inquiry into UK rendition of Libyan dissidents)  An aborted inquiry into UK rendition of Libyan dissidents to Gaddafi's hands says there is a case to be investigated.  20 December 2013 (Glitter as Terrorism)  Glitter as Terrorism.  20 December 2013 (Italy to shut or block access to sites without trial)  Italy will shut or block access to sites without trial if they are accused of facilitating sharing.  20 December 2013 (The "unemployment rate")  Republicans' method for reducing the unemployment rate is to cut unemployment benefits. In North Carolina, this made 77,000 people give up looking for work, so they are not longer counted in the "unemployment rate".  It is a mistake to judge the success or failure of government policies by the official unemployment rate. The real measure of unemployment is number of people who are of working age but not working or in school, and not independently wealthy.  20 December 2013 (Israeli troops shoot Palestinian in the back)  Israeli troops shot a Palestinian in the back, but said he was shooting at them.  20 December 2013 (Cows in the US fed litter from chicken cages)  Cows in the US are fed litter from chicken cages, and that includes beef.  This creates a danger of spreading mad cow disease.  20 December 2013 (The Environmental Defenders Office in Australia)  One of the missions of the Environmental Defenders Office in Australia is to make governments implement legal requirements to protect endangered species.  Officials, perhaps in bed with mining or logging interests, seem to wish to let these species be wiped out.  20 December 2013 (China to require journalists to take ideology exam)  China will require journalists to take an ideology exam.  20 December 2013 (UK gov't gives up pursuing large companies for dodged taxes)  The UK government has given up on pursuing large companies for around 60 billion dollars in dodged taxes.  20 December 2013 ($600,000 fine for distributing movie through torrent site)  A Swedish man was fined $600,000 for distributing a movie through a torrent site.  The copyright industry wants to imprison people for this. It is part of the War on Sharing, which we must put an end to.  20 December 2013 (Most Americans want gov't to reduce economic inequality)  Most Americans want the government to reduce economic inequality.  Though the plutocrats have failed to convince most Americans, they still have other strategies to prevent Americans from exercising control over the state.  20 December 2013 (Spain's right-wing gov't plans to ban abortions)  Spain's right-wing government will vary its attacks on the non-rich to attack women instead, by banning abortion with very limited exceptions.  20 December 2013 (Senator Warren's push to increase Social Security)  Senator Warren's push to increase Social Security seems to have made it politically impossible to cut Social Security.  This was very important, but we also need to increase government revenue by increasing taxes on the rich and on businesses. Also, while we are in a recession, we need deficit spending.  19 December 2013 (TAFTA threatens to give businesses increased power)  TAFTA, the proposed business deregulation treaty for the US and Europe, threatens to give many businesses increased power. For instance, it could blow away the just-established Volcker Rule, ban labeling of GMOs, make medicines more expensive, and stop countries from protecting data from spying by other countries.  TAFTA stands for "Turn All Freedom To Ashes".  19 December 2013 (Morsi faces another prosecution)  Morsi faces another prosecution on improbable charges of a terrorist conspiracy including Iran.  19 December 2013 (Facebook studies text that its useds type in and then don't submit)  Facebook carefully studies all the text that its useds type in and then don't submit.  19 December 2013 (NSA's goal is to eliminate privacy, world wide)  Glenn Greenwald told the EU that the NSA's goal is to eliminate privacy, world wide.  19 December 2013 (Amnesty for some political prisoners)  Putin hopes that amnesty for some political prisoners will wipe away the shame of having imprisoned them (and others) in the first place.  19 December 2013 (On the Front Lines of Class War)  On the Front Lines of Class War: Why the Fight for a Livable Wage is Everyone's Fight.  19 December 2013 (US Budget Deal)  US Budget Deal: the Good, Bad And Stupid.  19 December 2013 (UK gov't has allowed vital industries to shrug off rule of law)  The UK government, through deregulation and privatization, has allowed vital industries including food and banking to shrug off rule of law.  19 December 2013 (The latest censorship proposal)  The latest censorship proposal: ban saying that someone is fat.  Once you accept in principle the idea of forbidding some sort of insult, there is no natural stopping point; any statement that might hurt someone's feelings is likely to be banned.  I do not feel offended when people call me "fat", if they do not mean it as an insult, since it is undeniably true. If someone does mean it as an insult, that indicates a mental confusion on that person's part. Being fat is not an ethical failing.  It is amazing that Ms Lawrence is so sensitive to insults to her appearance &mdash; as if Einstein felt crushed if anyone said he was stupid. This bespeaks an inner insecurity that disregards objective reality. That insecurity is her real problem, not the insults.  19 December 2013 (The Rightwing Attack on Our Solar Future)  Let the Sun Shine In: The Rightwing Attack on Our Solar Future.  It's perfectly logical: someone who wants to sell as much fossil fuel as possible, and cares nothing about the rest of the world, would try to discourage, even prohibit installation of solar generators.  19 December 2013 (Trapwire files for "suspicious events")  Trapwire files for "suspicious events" show both idiocy and unofficial racial profiling.  19 December 2013 (The Big Spill made dolphins sick)  The Big Spill made dolphins sick, some fatally.  19 December 2013 (UK gov't will smother the inquiry into rendition)  The UK government will smother the inquiry into rendition by handing it to a picked committee of Parliament instead of a judge.  19 December 2013 (Frackers need not inform the people who live above the wells)  The UK government apparently fears people's opposition to fracking, so it says frackers need not inform the people who live above the wells.  This way, if they get sick, it won't occur to them to suspect fracking is the cause.  19 December 2013 (Turkish thugs fired and rebuked)  Turkish thugs that dared to arrest well-connected people for corruption charges have been fired and rebuked by President Erdogan.  19 December 2013 (How can pressure be put on Putin, and other Russian anti-gay bigots)  How can pressure be put on Putin, and other Russian anti-gay bigots?  19 December 2013 (2012 Olympics did nothing to spur exercise in England)  Ultimately, the 2012 Olympics did nothing to spur exercise in England. Their legacy to England consists of repressive laws and benefits for the rich.  19 December 2013 (ACLU praises Edward Snowden)  The ACLU praises Edward Snowden as an American patriot, and refutes the state's attacks on him.  19 December 2013 (Australian gov't will help businesses get away with illegal pollution)  The Australian government will cease funding the offices that advise people on protecting themselves from polluting industries. This is to help businesses get away with illegal pollution.  19 December 2013 (Australia's Human Rights Commissioner proposes to abolish one kind of censorship)  Australia's Human Rights Commissioner proposes to abolish one kind of censorship, which penalizes some "offensive" views.  This right-wing politician appears to have little real love for human rights. Nonetheless, Australia should abolish this censorship if it has an opportunity.  19 December 2013 (UK gov't has rejected EU funds for food banks)  The UK government has rejected EU funds for food banks.  After working so hard to make Britons so poor they cannot afford food, why would the government let the EU help them escape? That would spoil everything!  19 December 2013 (Urgent: Diplomacy with Iran)  US citizens: phone your senators at 202-224-3121 and say, no new sanctions against Iran &mdash; give diplomacy a chance.  19 December 2013 (The US-Ecuador investment treaty)  The arrogant international "tribunal" set up by a US-Ecuador investment treaty has already twisted the law and the treaty to make excuses to declare Chevron the winner against Ecuadorians.  I wonder why Ecuador has not withdrawn from this treaty. Even if the treaty should not properly apply to this case at all, other cases will arise in the future. The treaty can do no good, only harm.  19 December 2013 (Australia to imprison refugees on accusation, without trial)  Australia plans to imprison refugees on accusation, without trial, by requiring them to sign a "code of conduct" in which they promise not to commit crimes.  This means that if they are accused of crimes, rather than trying them like anyone else, functionaries can decide they have "violated the code of conduct," cancel their visas, and imprison them right away.  Meanwhile, the government has changed another "code of conduct", for ministers, to allow them to own stock in businesses.  Since these ministers were chosen to serve the interest of business anyway, if they have another personal reason to do that it might change nothing.  19 December 2013 (The Nelson Mandela Barbie doll)  Greg Palast: the Nelson Mandela Barbie doll.  19 December 2013 (Palm scanners in schools)  Schools in Puyallup, WA, are installing palm scanners for students to identify themselves with.  I think palm scanners are much less bad than fingerprint scanners, because people don't leave palmprints on everything they touch. Perhaps the palm scanners are ok, if the state can't get any personal data from them.  19 December 2013 (US gov't to deploy laser scanning system to detect chemicals on people)  The US government plans to deploy a laser scanning system that can detect even tiny quantities of chemicals in people's clothing and people's bodies.  19 December 2013 (Publisher being tried under censorship laws in Turkey)  The publisher of a Turkish edition of a raunchy book by Apollinaire is being tried under censorship laws.  19 December 2013 (Alleged food fraud gang in France arrested)  An alleged food fraud gang in France has been arrested. They took the meat of horses that had been used in medical experiments and labeled it as beef.  19 December 2013 (Boycott of Israeli academic institutions)  The members of the American Studies Association have approved the boycott of Israeli academic institutions.  Palestinians call for this boycott because Israeli universities have direct connections with the occupation of Palestine.  19 December 2013 (Campaign to secure cheap anti-hepatitis pills)  A global campaign aims to secure cheap anti-hepatitis pills.  The obstacle is the WTO, which requires countries such as India to allow patents on drugs.  This murderous policy is one of many reasons that the WTO must be abolished.  19 December 2013 (Amazon's warehouse workers in Germany on strike)  Amazon's warehouse workers in Germany have gone on strike.  Bravo!  19 December 2013 (Voicing the People's Anger, Yemen Parliament Calls for Drone Ban)  Voicing the People's Anger, Yemen Parliament Calls for Drone Ban.  19 December 2013 (Zoning limits pushing poor people out of US cities)  Zoning limits are pushing poor people out of US cities to far-away places from which commuting is hard and expensive.  I've opposed housing density limits since I saw this happening in Cambridge Massachusetts.  19 December 2013 (Buses not funded enough, because rich people don't take buses)  Around the world, buses are not funded enough, because rich people don't take buses.  18 December 2013 (Guards make noise to keep Ramzi bin al-Shibh from sleeping)  Ramzi bin al-Shibh, on trial in Guantanamo, keeps trying to tell the judge that guards make noise to keep him from sleeping.  This is a military kangaroo court rather than a proper trial. Is that supposed to make sleep deprivation of the defendant ok?  18 December 2013 (Obama's record on global heating)  Obama's record on global heating: with few exceptions, he supports it.  18 December 2013 (The European Commission objects to UK plans to subsidize nuclear power)  The European Commission objects to UK plans to subsidize nuclear power plants.  18 December 2013 (America's Greediest)  America's Greediest: The 2013 Top Ten.  Many economists say that the inequality that results from this greed costs even the rich, because it reduces the total economy.  Not that it matters ethically. Hurting the poor couldn't be justified by enriching the rich.  18 December 2013 (211 Journalists in World's Jails)  211 Journalists in World's Jails in 2013. The worst country is Turkey.  18 December 2013 (2013 was filled with extreme weather events)  2013 was filled with extreme weather events.  18 December 2013 (Billionaire Polluters found a large new oil field)  Billionaire Polluters has found a large new oil field in the Gulf of Mexico.  Shall we celebrate?  18 December 2013 (Libyan dissident imprisoned without trial in the UK)  Libyan dissident Ziad Hashem was imprisoned without trial in the UK, apparently based on information that Libyan torturers extracted from Abd-el-Hakim Belhaj after the UK and US delivered him to them.  If extraditing Abd-el-Hakim Belhaj secretly without the usual hearings was "approved by ministers", it demonstrates that that is insufficient as a safeguard.  18 December 2013 (Los Angeles Airport shooter has been accused of "terrorism")  The Los Angeles Airport shooter has been accused of "terrorism".  This attack does seem to be premeditated murder, but I think it is stretching the term "terrorism" to apply it here. Stretching strong words such as "terrorism" is a form of inflation that devalues them.  18 December 2013 (Former headteacher convicted of sexual assault on 5 students, all before 1970)  A British former headteacher (school principal, in US terms) has been convicted of sexual assault on 5 students, all before 1970.  The victims must have resented this for decades, which pretty clearly implies they were unwilling at the time. Thus, I think those acts do deserve to be crimes.  18 December 2013 (Forms of repression used in Saudi Arabia)  Human Rights Watch reports various forms of repression used in Saudi Arabia.  18 December 2013 (Wildfire destroyed houses in Big Sur)  It's December, normally the cooler and wetter season, but a wildfire destroyed houses in Big Sur.  It isn't proven yet, but one must suspect that this reflects the effects of global heating, which is expected to alter the base conditions towards the hotter and drier.  18 December 2013 (Vocational school gave radio transmitter tags to students and staff)  A vocational school in the UK gave radio transmitter tags to its students and staff for several years without telling them.  I think it is misleading to call these "RFIDs" because what they do is very different. Their signals show exactly where the wearer is located.  18 December 2013 (Bill to ban harassment by people who claim supernatural power)  The Indian state of Maharashtra has passed a bill to ban harassment by people who claim supernatural power.  However, the bill is weak.  This is in response to the murder of a rationalist campaigner.  18 December 2013 (Bank Of America played tricks)  Bank of America played tricks to avoid modifying American homeowners' mortgages, so it could foreclose them instead.  18 December 2013 (US senate should release its report into Bush regime torture practices)  The US Senate should release its report into Bush regime torture practices.  18 December 2013 (Lawsuit against NSA bulk collection)  A lawsuit against NSA bulk collection of phone records has more or less won at the trial court level. The judge issued a preliminary injunction ordering the NSA to stop collecting this metadata.  However, it's not really in effect because it will be appealed. I expect this case to go to the Supreme Court before anything really happens.  18 December 2013 (Protester that kissed a thug's helmet has been charged)  An Italian protester that kissed a thug's helmet has been charged with "sexual violence" and insulting the thug.  The first charge is blatant distortion of the facts, but the second shows blatant disrespect for freedom of speech. Freedom of speech includes the freedom to insult anyone, especially including officials. A state that denies this right is clearly in the wrong.  18 December 2013 (Urgent: Forbid employers to look at job candidates' credit reports)  US citizens: support Senator Warren's bill to forbid employers to look at job candidates' credit reports.  18 December 2013 (Urgent: Don't go on vacation without extending unemployment benefits)  US citizens: Tell Congress, don't go on vacation without extending unemployment benefits.  18 December 2013 (FDA will move to ban anti-bacterial soaps)  The FDA will move to ban anti-bacterial soaps unless they demonstrate health benefits.  The bactericides can cause harm, and there is a possibility that the killing of bacteria may lead indirectly to the spread of asthma because people's immune systems don't get trained as they should be.  18 December 2013 (60 Minutes Is Now in the Spin Business)  60 Minutes Is Now in the Spin Business.  18 December 2013 (Urgent: Do not allow advertising in public schools)  Everyone: call on Philadelphia not to allow advertising in its public schools.  18 December 2013 (US border thugs interrogated two New York Times reporters)  US border thugs interrogated two New York Times reporters about their journalistic activities as they were returning to the US. Now the Committee for Public Safety (oops, Department of Homeland Security) says it has no record of this.  18 December 2013 (Indian diplomat in the US faces criminal charges)  An Indian diplomat in the US faces criminal charges for paying a domestic servant less than the minimum wage and lying about it in her visa application.  The servant is also Indian. Indians should cheer that the US is doing something to protect poor Indians from exploitation by the Indian elite. Reportedly it is a long time since an Indian diplomat was arrested. It has probably been an even longer time since Indian servants' wages were protected in this way.  The strip search seems excessive, however, for the nature of the accusation.  18 December 2013 (Senator Warren's bill)  Senator Warren's bill would stop employers from discriminating (in effect) against poor people.  This bill would be a change for the better, but we also need to make more jobs, which calls for increased government spending. I'm sure Senator Warren is in favor of that too.  18 December 2013 (Spineless in Bali: Fooled Again by the WTO)  Spineless in Bali: Fooled Again by the WTO.  18 December 2013 (50 sailors on US navy ship have got cancer)  50 sailors on a US navy ship that brought aid to the Fukushima area have got cancer, and are suing TEPCO.  The ship carries around 3000 sailors. For 50 of those healthy adults, mostly in their 20s, to get cancer in under 3 years is amazing.  The ship is named after President Reagan, and his name should not be mentioned without reminding people how he harmed the US. He gave arms to terrorists in Lebanon to ransom hostages, to get funds to illegally fund terrorists in Nicaragua. He also launched the campaign to impoverish most Americans, which continues to this day. His supporters called him the Great Communicator, but Great Swindler would fit better.  18 December 2013 (Neonicotinoid pesticides cause brain damage to mouse fetuses)  Neonicotinoid pesticides cause brain damage to mouse fetuses, so they may harm human fetuses too.  18 December 2013 (AT&amp;T's latest method in the War on Sharing)  AT&T's latest method in the War on Sharing is a new user-profiling scheme to identify sharers, whom they call "pirates."  Please don't call them "pirates" &mdash; that is propaganda for the enemy.  Falkvinge: Our Free Society Stands Or Falls With Our Defense Of Sharing Knowledge And Culture.  18 December 2013 (NSA whitewash on 60 Minutes)  The Sad Decline of '60 Minutes' Continues With This Week's NSA Whitewash.  18 December 2013 (Seven ripoffs)  Seven Ripoffs That Capitalists Would Like to Keep out of the Media.  18 December 2013 (JROTC)  JROTC uses lots of money to convince American teenagers to join the army. It's instead of teaching them American history.  17 December 2013 (Admiration of Nelson Mandela's life)  Nelson Mandela's funeral has finished, after serving to illustrate the political issues of today's South Africa and how the US helped the apartheid state to capture him.  I admire Mandela's fight for freedom, and his personal courage, as much as before, and I reject the idea that he'd have to be perfect to deserve our admiration.  However, I am disappointed with the fuss that people make about his death. Why fetishize a corpse that used to be the body of a great person? A dead body is not a person anymore. It's not Mandela's corpse that deserves our admiration, but rather his life.  17 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on Washington Post to acknowledge it is owned by owner of Amazon)  Everyone: call on the Washington Post to acknowledge it is owned by the owner of Amazon, which has a big contract with the CIA.  17 December 2013 (Single mother who depend on food stamps have been forgotten)  The American single mothers who depend on food stamps have been forgotten by the mainstream media.  17 December 2013 (Suing for the right to plant vegetables in your front yard)  Suing for the right to plant vegetables in your front yard.  17 December 2013 (Snowden asking for asylum in Brazil)  Snowden writes to the people of Brazil asking for asylum there.  17 December 2013 (Refuting NSA falsehoods)  Refuting the NSA falsehoods that CBS presented on 60 Minutes.  17 December 2013 (UK's system of Internet censorship)  The UK's system of Internet censorship has been inaugurated.  People who use the Internet via public access points, schools, and so on will have no way to turn the censorship off.  17 December 2013 (Imprisoned for having microscopic amounts of marijuana)  People passing through Dubai airport are imprisoned for having microscopic amounts of marijuana in their pockets or even on the soles of their shoes.  I wonder how they detect these microscopic bits of marijuana. Are they using the inspection laser system that the US has been developing?  Some years ago it was reported that most US bank notes had traces of cocaine. I wonder if they will start imprisoning people who have US money on them.  Don't be a fool &mdash; reject all flight transfers in Dubai. Don't even think of flying on Emirates.  17 December 2013 (Fracking appears to leak endocrine disruptors)  Fracking appears in many cases to leak endocrine disruptors into water supply.  17 December 2013 ('Radical' [CO2] Emissions Reductions)  Scientists Explore Paths to 'Radical' [CO2] Emissions Reductions.  More information.  I do not think we need to consider the digital ration cards for carbon emissions, because a tax on carbon emissions could achieve the same reductions without the oppressive surveillance.  17 December 2013 (Mother Teresa gave sick people no painkillers and little medical care)  Mother Teresa gave sick poor people no painkillers and little medical care, because she believed that their suffering was "beautiful". This cruel sadist raised hundreds of millions of dollars, but didn't spend it to help them.  The media campaign to promote her has fooled many Americans into thinking that she was a great example of charity and goodness.  17 December 2013 (Chile's new President)  Chile's new President Bachelet promises reforms to spread the wealth and make education more accessible.  17 December 2013 (European couple in Egypt was jailed for a month)  A European couple in Egypt was jailed for a month, accused of a crime they couldn't possibly have committed, apparently only to pretend to the Chinese embassy that a complaint had been dealt with.  If this is how the Egyptian state treats foreigners, I shudder at what it must do to Egyptians.  17 December 2013 (Advertising of prescription drugs in the US)  Advertising of prescription drugs in the US is leading to greater and often improper use of the drugs.  17 December 2013 (Boston Thug Department's automatic license plate recognizers)  The Boston Thug Department's automatic license plate recognizers collected millions of records about lawful vehicles, but they repeatedly ignored one that was stolen.  Which reminds us not to judge surveillance technology by the official purpose but rather by its side effects.  17 December 2013 (Some experts call on Japan to hand over handling of Fukushima)  Some nuclear power experts call on Japan to hand over the handling of the Fukushima nuclear plants to an international team.  The cleanup also needs to have plenty of funds. TEPCO is hiring the cheapest workers it can get.  It appears that substantial amounts of radioactive cesium are continuing to leak out of the damaged reactors.  17 December 2013 (Salt on roads in New York State)  Salt on roads in New York State is coming from oil and gas wells, and it tends to be more toxic than ordinary salt.  16 December 2013 (Amazon cut off access for Christmas)  Amazon "sold" someone Disney Christmas videos, but not physical copies; subsequently Amazon, at Disney's command, cut off access for Christmas.  This demonstrates why we should not trust remote hosting disservices. Insist on having your own copy which is yours.  16 December 2013 (USaid rejects all support to abortion in poor countries)  USaid rejects all support to abortion in poor countries, and fear of this leads many women's health clinics in poor countries to refuse to do abortions at all.  16 December 2013 (32 Privacy Destroying Technologies)  32 Privacy Destroying Technologies That Are Systematically Transforming America [and the world] Into A Giant Prison.  16 December 2013 (A Genentech scam)  A Genentech scam against Medicare: selling a very expensive drug Lucentis where cheap Avastin would work just as well.  The article extends too much sympathy to pharma companies. They have corrupted the medical system in many ways, rip off Americans so much, and lobby for deadly patents in countries with lots of poor people, so they don't deserve sympathy.  16 December 2013 (Fighting in Syria as proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran)  Viewing the fighting in Syria as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.  I don't think Saudi Arabia is likely to use its influence to hold back Islamist extremists, since it has spent years funding and supplying them. There have been reports about this all along, and the US government must have know about this. The US ignored the Saudi connection as al-Qa'ida, boosted by Saudi money, took over the Syrian resistance to Iran's friend. What kind of strategy was that?  16 December 2013 ("Affluenza")  "Affluenza" is a new excuse for letting wealthy people escape punishment for crimes such as vehicular homicide.  I doubt whether a 20-year prison sentence is the best way to teach a 16-year-old not to drive while drugged and drunk. However, I agree with the article that, whatever society's best response is, the culprits should not be allowed to pay their way to more favorable treatment.  16 December 2013 (The ANC abandoned its plans for socialism)  The ANC, on abolishing apartheid, abandoned its plans for socialism to share the wealth with the impoverished. Did Mandela have a choice?  I don't advocate a Communism that would abolish private property and business. However, the decision to have private business still leaves a wide range of possible societies. Cruel societies such as today's US and Mexico are one option, but today's Scandinavia is also an option. Some socialist elements can make society much better for the non-rich while most work continues to be done by private businesses.  16 December 2013 (Global heating will melt all ice in the Arctic Ocean every summer)  A US Navy study predicts that before 2019 global heating will melt all the ice in the Arctic Ocean every summer.  This will cause global heating to accelerate, since the water surface will absorb more light, which currently the ice reflects out to space.  16 December 2013 (Three Ways the Super-Rich Suck Wealth Out of the Rest of Us)  Three Ways the Super-Rich Suck Wealth Out of the Rest of Us.  16 December 2013 (When Obama threatened to attack Syria)  Seymour Hersh: When Obama threatened to attack Syria, the US government did not know whether Sarin was used by Assad's men or by al-Nusra the Islamist fanatics. And it still does not know.  The destruction of chemical weapons is a good outcome, and I continue to support it. Cherry-picking intelligence to support a military attack is the sort of thing Dubya did.  16 December 2013 (Dredging Australia's new coal port)  Dredging Australia's new coal port is likely to wipe out several protected, endangered species and poison part of the Great Barrier Reef.  Burning the coal will kill the whole thing.  16 December 2013 (Ukraine is split)  Ukraine is split between a European-leaning western part that was and a Russian-leaning eastern part.  The split mainly derives from the partition of Poland in the late 1700s, when the Russian empire took the eastern part and the Austrian empire took the western part. However, the eastern part was under Mongol rule for centuries before Poland took it.  16 December 2013 (Palm oil producers continue destroying Sumatran rainforest)  Palm oil producers continue destroying Sumatran rainforest. Few orangutans remain.  16 December 2013 (Giving legislators a raise)  Giving legislators a raise, in the European parliament, resulted in their being less committed to their work.  I don't think this one study can justify concluding that higher pay necessarily causes less dedication.  15 December 2013 (US budget deal is cruel to the poor)  The US budget deal is cruel to the poor, and panders to the rich and business.  It is a compromise between mainstream right-wing and extreme right-wing.  15 December 2013 (The practice of making computers to last a short time)  The practice of making computers to last a short time and be replaced tremendously increases the quantity of toxic e-waste.  This also increases the demand for certain minerals to the point that armies fight over mines in Africa.  Banning the shipment of e-waste to poor countries is proving ineffective. Requiring a 3-year warranty for every computer sold might do a better job. Many of the purchasers would demand warranty service, so the manufacturers would have to make their products cheaper to repair. In addition, a lot of the waste would end up in the hands of authorized service agents. Regulating its disposal by them would be easier.  15 December 2013 (The next threat from Facebook)  The next threat from Facebook: using AI to figure out more about you.  If you refuse to be one of Facebook's useds and tell the AI about yourself, it will do what it can with the data it gets from Facebook surveillance &mdash; plus what other people tell it about you.  15 December 2013 (Islamist fanatics in Syria)  The Islamist fanatics in Syria greatly outnumber the secular rebels and are better equipped. Thus, if Assad's regime is replaced, the replacement will be worse.  15 December 2013 (Trade treaties used to block anti-smoking measures)  Tobacco companies pay corrupt governments to use trade treaties to block anti-smoking measures.  These murderous treaties must be destroyed!  15 December 2013 (What the state could find out with location data)  What the state could find out with location data from tracking you and other people you know.  15 December 2013 (PBS Budget Debate)  PBS Budget Debate: Wall Street, the Right and the Further Right.  15 December 2013 (Karzai's conditions to allow some US troops to remain in Afghanistan)  Karzai's conditions to allow some US troops to remain in Afghanistan: end air attacks (including drones) and facilitate peace.  15 December 2013 (Freedom of political speech widely threatened across Europe)  Freedom of political speech is widely threatened across Europe.  For instance, Spain is now considering a law to make it a crime to "insult Spain".  This is not to mention the censorship of specific views in many countries.  15 December 2013 (US drone attack killed 15 people on the way to a wedding in Yemen)  A US drone attack killed 15 people on the way to a wedding in Yemen.  This is a consequence of using drones as death squads, in places that are not battlefields. A wedding party would not travel through a battlefield; people would recognize the danger and stay under cover.  15 December 2013 (Australia's gun regulations could be a model for the US)  Australia's gun regulations could be a model for the US.  15 December 2013 (The population of barn owls in UK is crashing)  The population of barn owls in the UK is crashing because of various human activities.  Use of rat poison is one of them. Another is global heating, which paradoxically makes Britain colder in the winter.  15 December 2013 (Gov't of Colombia makes sure right-wing gangs can get away with rape)  The government of Colombia makes sure right-wing gangs can get away with rape so as to keep foreign companies happy.  The oppressive treaty with the US is another plan to keep foreign companies happy.  15 December 2013 (Indonesian soldiers massacred Papuan independence protesters)  In 1998, Indonesian soldiers massacred Papuan independence protesters, then tortured, mutilated and killed many of those taken prisoner.  15 December 2013 (Urgent: Oppose attempts to weaken the Endangered Species Act)  US citizens: urge your senators to oppose attempts to weaken the Endangered Species Act.  15 December 2013 (Latest Israeli excuses to reject peace with Palestine)  Uri Avnery on the latest Israeli excuses to reject peace with Palestine.  15 December 2013 (Urgent: Cut subsidies to agribusiness, not food stamps)  US citizens: call your congresscritter to cut subsidies to agribusiness, not food stamps. Also send mail through this page.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  15 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on India to abolish the law against homosexuality)  Everyone: call on India to abolish the law against homosexuality.  15 December 2013 ("Terminator" seeds)  Brazil may allow use of "terminator" seeds (biological restrictions management or BRM).  15 December 2013 (Fracking Hell)  Fracking Hell: What It's Really Like to Live Next to a Shale Gas Well.  15 December 2013 (Mass graves of Albanian Kosovars)  Mass graves of Albanian Kosovars give the lie to claims that the Serbs did not commit atrocities there.  15 December 2013 (Global heating and human trafficking)  Global heating leads to extreme weather disasters, and those lead the victims to be trafficked.  15 December 2013 (Too Many Secrets)  Too Many Secrets: Fixing the Government's Broken System for Classifying Information.  15 December 2013 (Amnesty for Snowden)  Some NSA officials said they would consider amnesty for Snowden if he stops revealing secrets.  This seems to be pure PR. They know that Snowden is no longer revealing any US secrets. He no longer has any! Before going to Russia, he divested himself of all copies so the data would not fall into Russian hands. Journalists have the data now.  Thus, what the NSA officials really proposes is to make Snowden a hostage to make the journalists stop publishing.  15 December 2013 (ISPs in Venezuela ordered to censor access to sites that publish black market exchange rate)  ISPs in Venezuela have been ordered to censor access to sites that publish the black market exchange rate between dollars and bolivars.  This is stupid as well as wrong. However, when judging the policy, keep in mind that many countries have similar (and equally wrong) policies, including quite a few in Europe.  Price controls tend to cause shortages, so they are generally an unwise policy. But they are not unjust like censorship.  15 December 2013 (Schools put students' personal data at risk)  Schools put students' personal data at risk by entrusting them to companies.  No matter what these companies might put in their contracts, centralizing data from schools in one company inherently makes them more vulnerable. In addition, these technologies increase the amount of data collection about a student.  The student's data should be kept on a physical memory that is the student's property, on loan to the school. Teachers should be allowed to look at the data when there is a valid reason, and the physical memory should be wiped after the term, leaving nothing but the grades.  15 December 2013 (US schools routinely terrify and traumatize kids)  US schools routinely terrify and traumatize kids in the name of protecting them from terror and trauma.  If we banned large magazines and guns that repeat at a high rate, much of the problem will go away.  I fear that these lockdowns will teach many children to think in the direction of shooting a lot of people, in school or elsewhere. When that's what you know (or think you know), you will think of that.  15 December 2013 (Poor People Deserve Digital Privacy, Too)  Poor People Deserve Digital Privacy, Too.  15 December 2013 (Workers vulnerable to being replaced by machine)  Companies have pushed workers to act like machines, which makes them very vulnerable to being replaced by a machine.  I think there is some truth in this article. At the same time, the approach it recommends won't put millions of long-term-employed back to work. If society does not need these people to work, it must offer them good lives anyway.  It is incoherent to say "If you don't work, you don't eat" and "There is no work for you" at the same time.  15 December 2013 (A "small" nuclear war between India and Pakistan)  A "small" nuclear war between India and Pakistan would produce a small nuclear winter. The loss of food production could endanger 2 billion people.  15 December 2013 (The UK's cruel cuts)  The UK's cruel cuts force many poor Britons to live on 3 dollars a day for food.  It is no surprise that these policies have not helped people find work. That was never a real goal, just an excuse to hurt people.  The reason these people are unemployed is that there are no jobs for them, and that is due to the spending cuts.  15 December 2013 (Illegal gold mining is driving deforestation in Peru)  Illegal gold mining is driving deforestation in Peru.  I think such phenomena demonstrate the importance of sharply cutting the birth rate. People will find ways to get money through extraction, especially if they have little other opportunity.  15 December 2013 (Greenpeace will continue protests against Arctic oil drilling)  Greenpeace declares it will continue protests against Arctic oil drilling, even in Russia.  15 December 2013 (Urgent: Reinstate workers who were fired for complaining about illegal low wages)  In companies where Domino's Pizza operates: tell the company to reinstate the workers who were fired for complaining about illegal low wages. Note, this campaign was successful.  15 December 2013 (Urgent: Withdraw US troops from Afghanistan)  US citizens: sign this petition to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan.  15 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on Obama not to gag John Podesta)  US citizens: call on Obama not to gag his new advisor John Podesta regarding the Keystone XL Earth-roaster pipeline, especially given that corrupt interests are operating unimpeded.  15 December 2013 (How ALEC presented itself to companies)  Documents show that ALEC presented itself to companies as making their profits its primary goal.  14 December 2013 (Renewable energy in South Africa)  Renewable energy is growing rapidly in South Africa, but coal interests want to tie the country permanently to coal exports.  14 December 2013 (Australian gov't abolishing environmental protection)  The Australian government is abolishing environmental protection by handing approval power solely to individual states.  14 December 2013 (Tyrant of North Korea executed his uncle)  The tyrant of North Korea executed his uncle, calling him "despicable human scum". Well of course &mdash; he was an official in North Korea, so how could he not be despicable human scum?  14 December 2013 (Controversial Anti-Protest Law Challenged in Ugandan Court)  Controversial Anti-Protest Law Challenged in Ugandan Court.  14 December 2013 (500 prominent writers published manifesto for restoring privacy)  500 prominent writers have published a manifesto for restoring privacy by curbing digital surveillance.  I agree with their manifesto, because it doesn't insist narrowly that the solution consists of limiting state access to massive dossiers while continuing to accumulate them.  It took me a while to find a place to refer to it, because the reference I saw was to a page I could not even view, on change.org. When I tried to view that page, all I got was a brief message saying the site requires Javascript and cookies even to see a page.  In addition, they ask people to endorse the statement on change.org. I won't do that, or refer others to that, because of the requirement for nonfree Javascript software.  So I am stating my agreement here.  14 December 2013 (Urgent: Give asylum to Edward Snowden)  Everyone: Urge German PM Merkel to give asylum to Edward Snowden in exchange for his testimony.  14 December 2013 (Japanese continue protesting against the new state secrets law)  Japanese continue protesting against the new state secrets law, which over 80% condemn.  14 December 2013 (Indiscriminate use of some antibiotics in farm animals)  The FDA is looking at stopping the indiscriminate use of some antibiotics in farm animals.  14 December 2013 (Victoria will legalize sexting by teenagers)  Victoria (a state in Australia) will legalize sexting by teenagers but only in narrow age bands. This is a step forward but not enough. No one should be punished for sexting, and the recipient of the sext shouldn't be punished either.  The law will also ban sending nude photos of someone else without that person's consent. That part seems ok to me.  13 December 2013 (Israel abandoned the plan to force Negev Bedouin off their lands)  Israel has abandoned the plan to force Negev Bedouin off their lands and into artificial villages where they have no livelihood.  However, the victory won't necessarily last.  13 December 2013 (Urgent: Oppose "fast track" for TPP)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to oppose "fast track" for the TPP. Also send mail through this page.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  13 December 2013 (US gov't decided to keep hunger strikes in Guantanamo secret)  The US government has decided to keep hunger strikes in Guantanamo secret to avoid the odium they shed.  13 December 2013 (Plastic in the Pacific Ocean)  A researcher studying plastic in the Pacific Ocean found that plastic has a larger presence than living organisms.  It turns out to be difficult to count the plastic in the ocean, and difficult to filter it out without catching the plankton.  13 December 2013 (Unarmed man charged with shooting people)  An unarmed man who did nothing worse than walk into the street has been charged with shooting people &mdash; who in fact were shot by the thugs.  To hold the criminal responsible for the consequences of the crime is valid when the crime is comparably grave. For instance, Dubya and B'liar should be held responsible for all the killings in Iraq caused by their invasion, including the killings carried out by the Sunni and Shi'ite militias as well as by the Bush forces.  However, putting a hand in a pocket is hardly grave enough to justify blaming anyone for other people's shootings. In addition, it gives the shooters immunity, which encourages them to shoot again.  13 December 2013 (The Theater of Security Agency shows no sense of shame)  The Theater of Security Agency shows no sense of shame after confiscating a two-inch-long toy pistol that was to be put on a puppet.  The idea that there is a principle that requires harsh, strict and pointless application of rules is a collective folly known as "zero tolerance". "Zero tolerance" is the basis for the school-to-prison pipeline. We must condemn the general idea, every time it comes up, and not only its crazy excesses.  13 December 2013 (Former prime minister of Thailand has been charged with murder)  The former prime minister of Thailand has been charged with murder for ordering snipers to shoot protesters.  13 December 2013 (Coca Cola Company trying to teach US waiters)  Coca Cola Company is trying to teach US waiters to discourage people from drinking tap water.  I usually have only tap water in restaurants, except in Chinese restaurants where large pots of tea are usually provided.  See also the boycott of Coca Cola Company.  13 December 2013 (Israel, Palestine and Jordan desalination project)  Israel, Palestine and Jordan made an agreement on a joint desalination project and will divide up the water.  13 December 2013 (Heroic whistleblowers)  Heroic whistleblowers call on spy agency employees to become whistleblowers.  13 December 2013 (New Zealand border thugs)  New Zealand border thugs took all of Samual Blackman's computers and disk drives.  They kept him incommunicado, and demanded he give them his passwords.  Blackman suspected this was because he went to a meeting in London about massive surveillance. The thugs said it is for some kind of censorship. We should not assume they told the truth, but if they did, that is no better. Censorship is evil too.  13 December 2013 (Protesters that interfere with business)  Today's law in Australia (and the US) would have made it a crime to send funds to "terrorists" such as Nelson Mandela, and maybe even to teach anti-apartheid activists how to use a photocopier. But that's not enough for right-wing politicians, who want to imprison protesters that interfere with business.  I guess those right-wing politicians support Putin's plans to imprison Greenpeace protesters.  It is a fundamental injustice to allow functionaries to label a group as "terrorist" without putting the group on trial and convicting it of that crime.  13 December 2013 (The Volcker rule)  The Volcker rule is so complex, and has many exceptions; it might not do its job very well.  13 December 2013 (Imprisoned for having a pro-Morsi symbol)  An Egyptian teenager has been imprisoned for having a pro-Morsi symbol on a ruler and notebooks in school. Many others have been punished for displaying the banned symbol.  Even though I disagree very strongly with what the symbol stands for, I am against this censorship.  12 December 2013 (Urgent: Reject the Scrooge budget deal)  US citizens: Tell Congress to reject the Scrooge budget deal.  12 December 2013 (Urgent: Support diplomacy with Iran)  Citizens of Massachusetts: call on the Massachusetts senators to support diplomacy with Iran.  12 December 2013 (Australian gov't denies short-term visa for medical treatment)  The Australian government's malice against foreigners has reached the point of denying a short-term visa for medical treatment.  12 December 2013 (Australia imprisons boat people in Papua New Guinea)  Australia imprisons boat people in Papua New Guinea, where homosexuality is illegal, and the prisoners have been told that any homosexual acts will be reported to the local thugs.  12 December 2013 (AT&amp;T offers discount in exchange for snooping on users)  AT&T offers a discount on broadband in exchange for snooping on users' browsing.  Another way to put it is, even a shadow of privacy costs extra.  I think this demonstrates the fallacy trying to address the problem of surveillance by saying users "own" the personal data that companies want. Companies have so much clout that they can get people to "sell" nearly anything &mdash; especially with mass unemployment and falling wages making people desperate.  12 December 2013 (Cookie used by Google to track users also used by the NSA)  Google uses a third-party cookie to track users from one site to another. The NSA looks at the same cookie to do the same job.  It's wrong for the NSA to track people in general, and wrong for Google to do it. We need to change browsers so they do not cooperate with this. GNU IceCat blocks most third-party material in web pages.  As for the cooperation that the NSA gets from portable phone apps, you should accept nothing less from proprietary software.  12 December 2013 (Thug threatens to kill dogs when lawyer demands warrant)  When lawyer Eric Crinnian told thugs they couldn't search his home without a warrant, a thug threatened to exercise the warrant at night, breaking down his door and kill his dogs, gratuitously.  That shows thugs' attitude towards our rights. If these threats by thugs are not illegal, we need to make them illegal.  Furthermore, the thugs should be required to carry audio recorders at all times when on duty. If when accused they don't present recordings to show the accusation is false, courts should take the citizen's word over the thug's word.  12 December 2013 (Students protest against anti-protest violence by UK thugs)  Students held protests around the UK against anti-protest violence by the thugs.  12 December 2013 (Earths awesome rate of CO2 emission)  Earth's awesome rate of CO2 emission, and what it means.  12 December 2013 (Pollution from coal kills 250,000 in China per year)  Pollution from coal burnt in China kills 250,000 people each year.  12 December 2013 (Fraudulent food an organized crime practice in the UK)  Fraudulent food is a widespread organized crime practice in the UK.  I attribute it to the deregulation that makes it easy to change the supply chain frequently.  12 December 2013 (Shareholders sue Aetna)  Aetna shareholders have sued the company for misleading them about its political spending.  12 December 2013 (Apple censoring all bitcoin apps for iThings)  Apple appears to be censoring all bitcoin apps for iThings.  It should be illegal to make or distribute computers which are platforms for censorship.  12 December 2013 (UK thugs systematically cancel domain names)  The UK thugs systematically cancel domain names without trial by quietly intimidating domain name registrars.  They do this in the name of the bogus concept of "intellectual property", propaganda that conveys a misunderstanding of the various unrelated laws it is applied to.  12 December 2013 (Israeli thugs attacked protesters)  Israeli thugs attacked protesters against the plan to kick the Bedouin of the Negev out of their homes and force them into villages where they have no livelihood. The thugs attacked even children with violence.  12 December 2013 (China considering a ban on smoking anywhere in public)  China is considering a ban on smoking anywhere in public.  I am strongly in favor of discouraging smoking, but I don't see a justification for going so far.  12 December 2013 (Focusing on whether a few women have an equal chance to be executives)  Focusing on whether a few women have an equal chance to be executives and board members is a distraction from how most women (and men) are treated by society.  12 December 2013 (Doctor that helped the US find Osama bin Laden)  The Pakistani doctor that helped the US find Osama bin Laden faces repeated bogus accusations, and his defense lawyer has been driven into exile by death threats.  To use a vaccination program as a front for a manhunt was extremely harmful because it fed suspicion of vaccination programs. This has impeded the eradication of polio.  However, that doesn't make these bogus charges valid.  12 December 2013 (Islamist fanatics seized supplies)  Islamist fanatics in Syria seized supplies that the US had provided to non-Islamist rebels.  12 December 2013 (Is it lawful for the USPS to record the outside of all envelopes?)  Is it lawful for the USPS to record the outside of all envelopes?  12 December 2013 (Global heating will affect bats' ability to echolocate)  Global heating of even a few degrees will affect bats' ability to echolocate.  In the long term, many thousands of years, bats could evolve to cope with this. But the heating we are causing today is too fast for evolution to adapt to.  12 December 2013 (Ice loss on West Antarctica)  Ice loss on West Antarctica is causing Antarctica, the continent, to shift.  12 December 2013 (An alpine glacier warming and melting rapidly)  An alpine glacier that was stable for thousands of years is warming up and melting rapidly.  12 December 2013 (Repeatedly watching TV coverage of a bombing)  Repeatedly watching TV coverage of a bombing can cause more stress than witnessing the bombing.  I know someone in California who was so traumatized by watching coverage of the Sep 2001 attacks as to become afraid to go outside.  That morning I made an intentional decision not to watch the coverage. It would have been both boring and anxiety-producing; all in all, I preferred to work on an article talking about the danger of sacrificing our freedom for "security".  12 December 2013 (Saudi Arabia has expelled a million foreign workers)  Saudi Arabia has expelled a million foreign workers, treating them horribly.  To tighten rules for allowing foreign workers, and expel some, is not in itself wrong. To kill them, or even to physically abuse them, is not excused by the decision to expel them. Denying them the chance to sell their property is also wrong.  12 December 2013 (Thugs attacked protesters in Ukraine)  Thugs attacked protesters in Ukraine.  The proposed deal with the EU might have traps in it. However, being dominated by Russia is very bad, and rejecting that does not require submission to the EU's temptation.  12 December 2013 (Uruguay has legalized regulated sale of marijuana)  Uruguay has legalized regulated sale of marijuana, but the people may not support it.  Marijuana is not addictive like tobacco and alcohol; ceasing use of marijuana does not cause withdrawal symptoms.  12 December 2013 (Homosexuality is once again a crime in India)  Homosexuality is once again a crime in India.  11 December 2013 (Biometric data collection)  In the UK, children have the right to opt out of biometric data collection.  11 December 2013 (British man being prosecuted for sex with teenager)  A British man is being prosecuted for having sex with a teenager who said she was having voluntary sex with him and asked please don't prosecute him.  His defense, as reported here, would be vile if anyone were likely to believe it. Since no one could take it seriously, I can't condemn him for saying it, but I don't see what the point is.  Overall, this is another example of "protecting" "children" in a way that does nothing but harm to everyone involved. They will probably say that he "raped" her.  11 December 2013 (Brazil's President Kubitschek was murdered)  Brazil's President Kubitschek was murdered by the military dictatorship which pretended he had been killed in a car crash.  11 December 2013 (UK thugs persistently infiltrated and snooped on anti-apartheid campaigners)  UK thugs persistently infiltrated and snooped on anti-apartheid campaigners.  11 December 2013 (Geithner is now a bankster)  Former treasury secretary Geithner is now a bankster.  Previously he was the "banksters' man in Washington."  11 December 2013 (Australian gov't trying to intimidate public broadcasting organization)  The Australian government is trying to intimidate the Australian public broadcasting organization ABC so it won't publish news such as that Australia was spying on Indonesia.  The accusation of "cannibalizing local media" might be true, but if so, the solution is not what the right-wing government would want to do.  11 December 2013 (FBI has launched prosecutions of prison guards in LA)  The FBI has launched prosecutions of prison guards in LA.  I am glad to see the statement that they will prosecute even though these abuses have become institutional. If only they adopted the same policy towards banksters.  11 December 2013 (Urgent: Universal health care bill)  US citizens: urge Senator Rockefeller to co-sponsor Senator Sanders' universal health care bill.  11 December 2013 (Urgent: Renew credits for renewable energy)  US citizens: call on your senators to renew credits for renewable energy.  You might as well call on them at the same time to cut subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.  11 December 2013 (Obama pardons)  Obama pardons turkeys but hardly ever pardons human beings.  11 December 2013 ("Corporate social responsibility")  "Corporate social responsibility" practices can psychologically influence executives to adopt antisocial policies feeling that they already did their good deed for the year.  One study is not enough to prove this is true, but if it is, it suggests that we need to tax companies more to pay for social needs rather than inviting companies to make donations.  11 December 2013 (Chinese agents kidnaped human rights activist)  Chinese agents kidnaped human rights activist Wang Bingzhang from Vietnam, and imprisoned him for life after a secret trial. He has been in solitary confinement for a decade.  This is what the US calls "rendition".  11 December 2013 ("Away from the center" according to Washington Post)  The Washington Post warns that Senator Warren might pull the Democratic Party "away from the center" by championing progressive policies.  This is despite the fact that Americans generally agree with them.  This "center" is only a "center" in the sense of being located in between the two mainstream right-wing parties. It's used to suppress what most Americans want.  11 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on Suffolk University to reject funding from Koch brothers)  In the US: call on Suffolk University to reject politicized funding from the Koch brothers.  11 December 2013 (Urgent: Oppose any new sanctions on Iran)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and say you oppose any new sanctions on Iran now &mdash; give diplomacy a chance!  Then report your call.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  11 December 2013 (Euro crisis used as excuse to wipe out workers' rights)  European governments have used the euro crisis as an excuse to wipe out workers' rights and adopt US-style precarity.  It adds up to a campaign that attacks workers' rights in one country at a time.  11 December 2013 (Australia likely to need twice as many firefighters by 2030)  Australia is likely to need twice as many firefighters by 2030 due to effects of global heating.  11 December 2013 (US "zero tolerance")  US "zero tolerance" reaches new heights of insanity: a child is threatened with expulsion from school for miming the shooting of an imaginary arrow with an imaginary bow.  11 December 2013 (NSA snoops on users of online games)  The NSA snoops on chats between users of online games.  11 December 2013 (How schools teach gender stereotypes)  How schools teach gender stereotypes.  11 December 2013 (How unemployment benefits create jobs)  How unemployment benefits create jobs.  11 December 2013 (The Volcker rule)  Finally the US will adopt the Volcker rule to restrict banks' speculation.  I am worried that the complexity of the rule will make it hard to enforce. We will see.  As for the possibility that this will reduce banks' speculation, I hope so. Too large a fraction of the US GNP goes to banks.  11 December 2013 (Who will put the bell on the cat?)  Who will put the bell on the cat? You!  11 December 2013 (Canada wants to claim seabed at north pole)  Canada wants to claim the seabed at the north pole for the fossil fuels there.  Oil and natural gas from the north pole have no value because they will never be used. To extract even 30% of the known reserves will lead to global heating disaster. Before civilization gets to the point of extracting the expensive fossil fuels from the north pole, it will collapse.  However, Canada and companies can pretend these fuel reserves have value, thus adding to the carbon bubble.  11 December 2013 (Movement Rises to Kick 'Corporate Reform' Out of Public Schools)  Movement Rises to Kick 'Corporate Reform' Out of Public Schools.  09 December 2013 (AIG gets bail-out while Detroit and Chicago workers get pension cuts)  Why does bankrupt AIG get a bail-out while bankrupt Detroit and Chicago workers get pension cuts?  09 December 2013 (Thai gov't calls new elections)  The Thai government called new elections to cater to protesters' demands.  09 December 2013 (Edward Snowden wins Guardian's person of the year election)  Edward Snowden won the Guardian's person of the year election.  When I talk about surveillance in my speeches, I call for "three cheers for Edward Snowden." You might think this is superfluous because everyone knows that he deserves our admiration. Not so! US politicians (especially those that support massive surveillance) continue trying to demonize Snowden. We have to defeat them, and the way to do it is by showing our views.  09 December 2013 (The Over-Policing of America and Criminalizing Everyday Life)  The Over-Policing of America and Criminalizing Everyday Life.  09 December 2013 (Urgent: Transparency about gov't surveillance from Verizon and AT&amp;T)  In the US: call on Verizon and AT&amp;T to support transparency about government surveillance.  09 December 2013 (Urgent: Support diplomacy with Iran)  US citizens: Tell Congress to support diplomacy with Iran, not to sabotage it.  09 December 2013 (Senator Warren proposes ways to increase Social Security)  Senator Warren rejected the idea of formulating the issue of Social Security in terms of how much to cut, and proposed ways to fund increasing it.  Cutting social security is a right-wing idea that most Americans reject. Please don't grant it a sort of legitimacy by calling it the "center". It is only "central" between the two right-wing major parties.  09 December 2013 (The boycott of Israeli academic institutions)  The American Studies Association voted to join the boycott of Israeli academic institutions.  This follows a debate at a meeting in which over 80% of the speakers (randomly chosen from those who asked to speak) supported the boycott.  The full membership is now voting on the resolution.  09 December 2013 (Israel's obsolete "security concerns")  Uri Avnery: Kerry is making the mistake of taking Israel's obsolete "security concerns" seriously.  09 December 2013 (The K Street Perversion of Cost-Benefit Analysis)  The K Street Perversion of Cost-Benefit Analysis.  09 December 2013 (Amnesty International to sue UK about phone call snooping)  Amnesty International will sue the UK about probable phone call snooping.  The UK government has created excuses to ignore such cases by hearing the evidence secretly.  09 December 2013 ($8 trillion spent by US Pentagon to guard oil)  Solar Would Be Cheaper: US Pentagon Has Spent $8 Trillion to Guard Gulf Oil.  Without the large government subsidies for fossil fuel, solar would be cheaper anyway.  09 December 2013 (Life is more fun in a society with more equality)  Life is more fun in a society with more equality.  09 December 2013 (Japan Reacts to Fukushima Crisis By Banning Journalism)  Japan Reacts to Fukushima Crisis By Banning Journalism.  09 December 2013 (Merger between American Airlines and US Airways)  The US has given up resisting a merger between American Airlines and US Airways, which will mean even less competition.  09 December 2013 (European Parliament wants to talk with Snowden by video)  The European Parliament wants to talk with Snowden by video.  I am surprised that Snowden is willing to do this. A couple of months ago, he refused to speak remotely with the German Parliament; he insisted on getting a safe-conduct to go there.  09 December 2013 (Urgent: Take a clear stand against fast track for the TPP)  US citizens: Phone Nancy Pelosi's office to pressure her to take a clear stand against "fast track" for the TPP.  09 December 2013 (Radioactive material leaking from Fukushima meltdown will kill people)  The radioactive material leaking from the Fukushima meltdowns will kill people, including an estimated 800 eventual deaths (not soon) from eating contaminated fish.  This is 800 out of the millions who are likely to eat some of that fish.  800 deaths is a large number to result from a single accident. It is important to try to stop more radiative material from leaking into the ocean from Fukushima, since that as it continues leaking, it could kill more hundreds.  On the other hand, the danger to any individual from these leaks is minuscule; there is no point taking any trouble to make sure you never eat even a little of that fish.  09 December 2013 (Urgent: Ban menthol cigarettes)  US citizens: call on the FDA to ban menthol cigarettes. Menthol in cigarettes encourages people to start smoking.  09 December 2013 (Humanity is unprepared for possible abrupt climate impacts)  Humanity is unprepared for possible abrupt climate impacts.  08 December 2013 (Urgent: Oppose getting palm oil from deforestation)  In the US: call on the Consumer Goods Forum to require its members to stop getting palm oil from deforestation.  08 December 2013 (Urgent: Demand a hearing about Keystone XL pipeline)  US citizens: Phone Senator Warner's office to demand a hearing about the Keystone XL pipeline.  08 December 2013 (American Library Association denounces NSA surveillance)  The American Library Association has denounced NSA surveillance.  I think libraries should adopt a system that makes it difficult for the library to find out who has borrowed a book unless the book becomes overdue.  08 December 2013 (Mandela quotes)  12 Mandela Quotes That Won't Be In the Corporate Media Obituaries.  I think it is very important for outside observers to monitor elections in most countries, and perhaps the US needs them too.  08 December 2013 (Violent porn should not be censored)  We're supposed to be concerned about anonymous web sites because some of them distribute violent porn.  I don't want to watch violent porn, or violent non-porn, but neither should be censored.  However, if a business sells videos of real rapes or other real crimes and pays or rewards those who commit the crimes, the business participates in those crimes. That is valid grounds for prosecution.  I am surprised that the credit card payments can't be used to trace the business that runs the site.  08 December 2013 (Nelson Mandela's life falsified by mainstream media)  Mainstream media commemorations of Nelson Mandela's life often falsify him, pretending that he stood for nonviolent resistance.  Mandela was right: nonviolence is not the only ethical way to resist oppression. Those oppressed with violence are entitled to fight back with violence. Of course, the founding fathers of the United States said the same thing about resistance to British oppression.  Here Mandela explains the ANC's motives for adopting first sabotage, then guerrilla warfare.  Chief among them was that the state's crackdown on dissent had closed off the possibility of nonviolent resistance.  08 December 2013 (Shanghai raises threshold for alerts of bad air quality)  Shanghai's solution to frequent bad air quality is to >raise the threshold for alerts.  08 December 2013 (Large leak at uranium mine in Australia)  A large leak at a uranium mine in Australia has been contained &mdash; for now.  08 December 2013 (Error behind claim that male and female brains are wired differently)  The error behind claims that male brains and female brains are wired very differently.  08 December 2013 (Urgent: Extend unemployment insurance)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and say, "Don't play Scrooge &mdash; extend unemployment insurance." Also sign this petition.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  08 December 2013 (Urgent: Support cuts to military)  US citizens: state your support for cuts to the military and the people's budget.  08 December 2013 (Urgent: Let Congress decide on whether to keep troops in Afghanistan)  US citizens: insist that Congress have the chance to approve or reject any agreement to keep troops in Afghanistan.  08 December 2013 (The Great Corporate Tax Shift)  The Great Corporate Tax Shift.  08 December 2013 (Dangerous proposal against net neutrality in EU Parliament)  La Quadrature du Net: Net Neutrality: EU Parliament Must Amend Kroes' Dangerous Proposal.  08 December 2013 (UK trying to quietly bury most accusations of killing prisoners)  A UK soldier has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for killing a prisoner in Afghanistan.  However, the UK government is trying to quietly bury most accusations of killing prisoners.  08 December 2013 (Chicken sold in the EU with 30% added water)  Some chicken sold in the EU has 30% added water.  08 December 2013 (Barbie dolls)  Barbie dolls have changed: now all their outfits are hypersexy.  08 December 2013 (Newly passed bill discourages use of patents of questionable validity)  The House of Representatives passed a bill discouraging the use of patents whose validity is questionable, and some other abusive practices.  This bill would be a step forward, but it fails to address today's biggest patent aggressors, such as Apple.  The real solution to the problem of patents in the software field is to take software out of the scope of patents.  08 December 2013 (Right-wing political "think tanks")  How right-wing political "think-tanks" operate, perhaps mislead the IRS, and are tied to ALEC.  08 December 2013 (Abdulelah Haider Shaye receives Human Rights Defenders award)  Journalist Abdulelah Haidar Shaye, imprisoned in Yemen on request from Obama himself, was given the Alkarama Human Rights Defenders award.  08 December 2013 (Mainstream media downplays danger of global heating)  The mainstream media that supported Dubya's conquest of Iraq, treating weak evidence as sufficient, now downplays the danger of global heating, treating powerful evidence as dubious.  I suspect that both show oil money at work.  07 December 2013 (John F Kennedy Jr. killed by a bomb in his plane?)  This site alleges that John F Kennedy Jr. was killed by a bomb in his plane, which was followed by a US government coverup effort, and alleges this was done by Israeli secret agents because he was about to publish secrets of their involvement in the assassination of Israeli Premier Rabin.  This extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof, and this article isn't enough. So I am not convinced this claim is true. But I think it is not immediately dismissable. To verify the truth of the facts cited would be a lot of work. I don't have time to do that.  Thus I have decided to point readers at his report without saying I believe any of it.  07 December 2013 (Some pro-Morsi protesters were released with suspended sentences)  Some pro-Morsi protesters were released with suspended sentences, meaning that if they protest again they will automatically be imprisoned.  The UK uses a similar nasty trick, giving accused protesters bail with conditions banning them from coming anywhere near a protest.  07 December 2013 (Apple tracking)  Apple will invite fanboys to let it track them around the Apple Store.  07 December 2013 (Geoengineering could lead to war)  Geoengineering could lead to war between countries that have different needs for how to engineer the Earth's climate.  Any geoengineering method that aims to affect temperature directly will not do anything to stop ocean acidification due to dissolved CO2. This threatens to destroy all coral reefs, along with all the other species that depend on coral reefs. The result could easily be the loss of most of the sea food that a billion humans depend on.  In experiments, CO2 affected the behavior of some species of fish too -- they ceased to hide from predators. That could wipe them out.  07 December 2013 (Refuse to surrender to the privatization of the university)  Suspended student protest leaders in Sussex University say they refuse to surrender to the privatization of the university.  07 December 2013 (Thugs in London punched student protesters)  Thugs in London punched student protesters and pushed them to the ground.  One student leader said he thinks this was a planned tactic intended to pre-emptively intimidate other students who might potentially join protests. Instead it inspired a "cops off campus" protest.  07 December 2013 (Facebook is a tax dodger)  Facebook is a tax dodger.  Of course, it's not the only one, but that is no excuse.  07 December 2013 (A Move Towards Generalised Internet Surveillance in France?)  A Move Towards Generalised Internet Surveillance in France?  Many states are launching preemptive attacks to abolish privacy rights before people get motivated to defend them.  07 December 2013 (Wikileaks activist wanted not to go home)  Wikileaks activist Sarah Harrison has been warned not to go home to the UK because its laws can label any sort of protest as "terrorism".  07 December 2013 (ALEC says it is in favor of "local control")  ALEC says it is in favor of "local control", but many of its proposed state laws are designed to prohibit local regulation of business, even prohibit local municipal broadband.  07 December 2013 (Urgent: Support bills to reduce harsh minimum sentences)  US citizens: call on your senators to support bills to reduce harsh minimum sentences for nonviolent drug crimes, including for those already in prison.  07 December 2013 (Urgent: Present success stories of Obama's health care law)  US citizens: call on CBS to present the success stories of Obama's health care law.  07 December 2013 (Social movements criticize the WTO agreement)  Social movements criticize the WTO agreement.  07 December 2013 (Cuts in health care are subjecting old people in UK to pain and danger)  Conservatives' cuts in health care are subjecting old people in the UK to pain and danger by delaying needed operations.  07 December 2013 (Pakistani anti-drone protesters blocked US supplies to Afghanistan)  Pakistani anti-drone protesters have blocked US supplies to Afghanistan for 10 days. They say they will continue until the US stops the drone attacks.  As weapons of war, drones are not very different from bombers with human crews. Drones raise a special issue when they are used away from battlefields, in countries where the US says it is not fighting &mdash; Pakistan, for instance. In these cases, they more resemble death squads or terror campaigns than a war.  07 December 2013 (Senator Warren call for big banks to disclose contributions to "think tanks")  Senator Warren called for the big banks to disclose their contributions to "think tanks" (which in many cases are really right-wing pressure groups).  Suffolk University denounced a right-wing think tank that it hosts for a politically-minded campaign to undermine regional greenhouse gas reduction initiative.  07 December 2013 (Network of right-wing "think tanks")  A network of right-wing "think tanks" campaign for right-wing laws in many US states.  07 December 2013 (Urgent: Cut the military budget)  US citizens: phone your senators and urge them to cut the military budget. Also sign this petition. The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  07 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on Senator Warren to endorse deal with Iran)  Citizens of Massachusetts: call on Senator Warren to endorse the deal with Iran.  07 December 2013 (Another apology that deserves an apology)  Another apology that deserves an apology: Martin Bashir's apology for what he said about Sarah Palin.  Bashir said that if anyone deserved the punishments that slaves received, it would be Ms Palin. The use of "deserved" indicates a counterfactual: Bashir explicitly avoided saying that she, or anyone, deserves those punishments. He was criticized wrongly for a palinode that was entirely justified.  07 December 2013 (Urgent: Oppose bill to increase NSA massive surveillance)  US citizens: call on your senators to oppose Senator Feinstein's bill to increase NSA massive surveillance.  07 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on mining company not to sue Costa Rica in World Bank)  Everyone: call on a mining company not to sue Costa Rica in the World Bank.  07 December 2013 (Urgent: Stop funding ALEC)  US citizens: call on all companies to stop funding ALEC.  06 December 2013 (US gov't lies in court about use of no-fly list to block witness)  Rahinah Ibrahim's daughter, who is a US citizen, was supposed to go to the US and testify as a witness in Ms Ibrahim's lawsuit. The US government blocked her return by putting her on the no-fly list, then lied about it in court.  This article says that the list Rahinah is suing to be removed from is the no-fly list.  The government's lawyers are claiming that the government can exclude "secret" information from the case even if it has been published. We've seen this contempt for reality in the Obama regime's attitude towards secrets revealed by Wikileaks and Snowden.  Over and over we see that US government agents are willing to lie to achieve their missions. Some lie to Congress, while others lie in court. These lawyers should be disbarred, just as Clapper should be jailed for contempt of Congress.  06 December 2013 (Thanksgiving at Toys-R-Us)  Toys-R-Us tried to replace the idea of Thanksgiving with the idea of "I want more".  06 December 2013 (World Cup provides excuse to evict 19,000 poor families)  The World Cup has provided an excuse to evict 19,000 poor families in Rio de Janeiro and move them up to 25 miles away.  06 December 2013 (Bloggers arrested in Iran)  Five bloggers have been arrested in Iran for publishing criticism of the theocratic tyranny.  06 December 2013 (Brazil will attack protesters' legal rights)  Brazil will attack protesters' legal rights on behalf of the World Cup.  06 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on Google, Facebook and Yelp not to fund ALEC)  Everyone: Sign this petition calling on Google, Facebook and Yelp not to fund ALEC.  06 December 2013 (Isa Muaza won a new court heating)  Isa Muaza, who has been on hunger strike more than 100 days, won a new court hearing about whether he can stay in the UK.  06 December 2013 (Solitary confinement for advocating proper medical care)  Prisoner Carol Lester was put in solitary confinement for advocating proper medical care for other prisoners.  The privatized prison can't make a profit without squeezing someone, so it has a reason to isolate those who complain about the squeezing. But non-privatized prisons use solitary confinement eagerly too.  05 December 2013 (GMO corn and cancer)  After the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology published a paper reporting that GMO corn caused cancer in rats, it hired a new editor who used to work for Monsanto, and he retracted the paper.  The article links to change.org, which is unfortunate since you can't sign an article there except by running a nonfree program. The same with links to vimeo.  05 December 2013 (Egyptian military repression)  The Egyptian military government has shown clearly that repression isn't just for Islamists.  The proposed new constitution allows various sorts of repression.  05 December 2013 (Sussex University sparked strong student resistance)  Sussex University sparked strong student resistance by suspending 5 students, including some who participated in an occupation protest, and at least one who didn't participate.  Note the standard bullshit statement from the university administration saying that it has to do this to protect "students, staff and visitors" from disruption or (in their imagination only) worse.  This is part of a broader pattern of students' campaigning for decent treatment of workers, and increased repression by the state which advocates bad treatment of workers.  05 December 2013 (Biggest threat to Israel's security)  The former head of Israel's secret service said that the biggest threat to Israel's security is its refusal to make peace with Palestine.  05 December 2013 (Marijuana Legalization Plan)  Uruguayan President Asks for World to Support His Marijuana Legalization Plan.  States should withdraw from that 1961 UN treaty.  05 December 2013 (Methods that will enable blocking anything in the future)  The methods now being developed to obstruct access to "child" pornography will enable blocking anything in the future, such as perhaps the revelations of the next Snowden.  05 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on Obama to support reform of the ECPA)  US citizens: sign this petition calling on Obama to support reform of the ECPA to require the government to get a warrant to examine people's email.  This is a fairly small change: under current law, the warrant is needed for recent emails (those that arrived in the last 6 months), but not needed for emails that have remained for longer.  05 December 2013 (Urgent: Stop the wave of TV station mergers)  US citizens: call on the FCC to block the wave of TV station mergers.  05 December 2013 (Urgent: Publish names of Third Way's financial sponsors)  Everyone with a relation to the US: tell Third Way to publish the names of its financial sponsors, so we know the origin of its "advice" to Democrats not to be real Democrats like Elizabeth Warren.  05 December 2013 (Urgent: Tell companies not to join ALEC again)  Everyone: tell companies that quit ALEC not to join it again, not even under a different name.  05 December 2013 (Scandals revealed by ALEC leak)  Scandals revealed by the ALEC leak:   The organization's choice of issues to focus on is determined by how much business money various issues bring in.  It claims to have grown while in fact it has lost membership.  It is changing its legal status, with a new name, hoping to lure companies back and escape charges of violating tax laws.   05 December 2013 (NSA collects 5 billion cell phone locations per day)  The NSA collects 5 billion cell phone locations per day, from hundreds of millions of phones.  The NSA uses this to determine when people meet each other physically. Thus, if you are going to a meeting, take the batteries out of your phone well before you get to it, as a courtesy to those you will meet with.  Here are some significant conclusions.  We did not know that the NSA was tracking phones world-wide, but we have known all along that they were being tracked by phone companies, and the governments that control them, and often by Apple and Google too. That's already unacceptable.  I have never "connected to our modern communication system" because I refused to be tracked. I have refused for 15 years now. This does not require me to "live in a cave". In my travels, if I need to make a call in a train or on the street, I ask whoever is there to call for me.  05 December 2013 (Why We Need A State - FIX)  A horrible typo was fixed in Why We Need a State. It incorrectly said "the many non-poor" when it should have said "the many non-rich".  05 December 2013 (Ads tuned based on people's emotional state)  The next "advance" in exploiting people through their computers: ads tuned based on people's emotional state.  These ads are typically shown by software and services that are malicious in other ways &mdash; for example, a game server that monitors you might also show ads based on figuring out when you are vulnerable, or a car might monitor your emotional state using proprietary software you can't change.  05 December 2013 (Attempts to justify cultural practices with evolutionary stories)  Be skeptical of attempts to invent evolutionary stories to justify cultural practices such as sexism.  It is very difficult to tell whether a widespread human behavior pattern is genetically determined or not.  05 December 2013 (How the UK can win independence from the banksters)  The UK could win independence from the banksters simply by exiting the EU.  Then it would be able to tax businesses including Amazon that extract money from the UK.  05 December 2013 (Gas companies sue cities that have imposed bans on fracking)  Gas companies are suing cities that have imposed bans on fracking.  We need a national ban on fracking. Most known fossil fuel reserves need to be left in the ground, and the first to be left are those whose extraction might poison water supplies.  Riot thugs attacked anti-fracking protesters in Romania so that Chevron could start fracking, and kept journalists away so they could hide their dirty work.  05 December 2013 (Devastation of large animals in the Sahara)  Large animals in the Sahara has been devastated &mdash; many are extinct or remain in only a small part of their former range.  05 December 2013 (Commercial advertising in Philadelphia schools)  Philadelphia should reject commercial advertising in schools.  05 December 2013 (EU monitors wanted to report election rigging in Honduras)  A whistleblower in the EU team of election monitors in Honduras says most of the team wanted to report the election was rigged, but the team leaders insisted on approving it.  05 December 2013 (Detroit allowed to declare bankruptcy)  Detroit has been allowed to declare bankruptcy. This is likely to mean drastic pension cuts for present and former city workers.  05 December 2013 (Former Stanford student sues to get taken off "terrorist watch list")  Rahinah Ibrahim, formerly a student at Stanford, is suing to get taken off a US "terrorist watch list", or at least find out if she is really on it.  I can't tell whether the list in question is the "no-fly" list or some other list. Does anyone know?  05 December 2013 (Surveillance in subways and City Colleges of Chicago)  Chicago's subways make it very expensive not to be spied on, and the City Colleges of Chicago demand biometric ID from the staff.  I would be willing to use a biometric system to get my pay, if it tested some part of my body other than my finger tips.  05 December 2013 (Traceability requirements for meat in Europe)  The French government says that the EU, supported by the UK, are blocking stricter traceability requirements for meat.  05 December 2013 (Ethical questions for custodians of the natural world)  Ethical questions for custodians of the natural world.  I don't think that animals in general have a right to life &mdash; not even whales. I don't think, for instance, that we have a duty to stop orcas (one type of whale) from killing other whales as we would protect humans from being killed. I don't think we have a duty to stop chimps from killing other chimps.  But it is important to prevent the loss of species and ecosystems, because that is an irrecoverable loss.  04 December 2013 (Urgent: Oppose the TPP)  Everyone: sign this petition opposing the TPP.  04 December 2013 (Urgent: End the sequester)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to end the sequester which is killing more jobs every year.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  04 December 2013 (Urgent: Require public companies to disclose political spending)  US citizens: Once again, tell the SEC to move forward with requiring public companies to disclose political spending.  The SEC said it would do this, then quietly dropped it.  04 December 2013 (Noam Chomsky: America Hates Its Poor)  Noam Chomsky: America Hates Its Poor.  He explains how the "tea party" idea that "We want the government off our backs" is used to distract working-class Americans from organizing for Liberal (social-democratic) that they favor when asked.  04 December 2013 (Law to impose nasty copyright punishments in Canada)  Canada's legislature is quietly pushing a law to impose nasty copyright punishments.  Please don't follow this article by using the term "intellectual property" to formulate your thoughts or your words.  04 December 2013 (NSA gives staff "talking points" that praise the NSA)  The NSA gave its staff "talking points" to tell their families, praising the NSA and its massive surveillance. This article refutes them.  04 December 2013 (FCC chairman advocates selling privileges to certain web sites)  The new chairman of the FCC in his first speech endorsed network neutrality as a principle, then advocated selling privileges to certain web sites, although that directly conflicts with network neutrality.  04 December 2013 (Australian gov't stops giving visas to asylum seekers)  The government of Australia wants to give refugees arriving by boat temporary visas instead of permanent visas, but since the opposition blocked the law to make this change, the government has decided arbitrarily not to give visas to asylum seekers at all.  In effect, it is holding recognized refugees hostage to ram through that law.  04 December 2013 (Japanese politician equates protesters' shouts to terrorism)  An important Japanese politician, defending the proposed anti-whistleblower law, said protesters' shouts were in essence much like terrorism.  04 December 2013 (Scientists expect greater sea level rise than IPCC predicts)  A survey of climate scientists suggests most expect sea level rise to be more than the IPCC predicted.  How much sea level rises will depend on unknown aspects of global heating but also on how much greenhouse gas we emit.  04 December 2013 (Obama regime is "most hostile" to journalists in US history)  Former CNN correspondent Bob Franken says that the Obama regime is the "most hostile" to journalists in US history.  04 December 2013 (Prohibition of "child pornography")  Prohibition of "child pornography" led to charges against journalists that published a video of two students having sex in a classroom alongside an article  I wish I knew who made the video, who distributed it, and whether the students in it approved of doing so. Depending on those facts, someone might have done something wrong here, but probably not the news site.  04 December 2013 (2C of global heating)  A study projects that 2C of global heating in the short term would lead to considerably more later.  Thus, it is not an adequate target for curbing short-term heating &mdash; and yet it is almost unattainable.  04 December 2013 (Full-Time video surveillance of a home for a long period of time)  The EFF argues in court that full-time video surveillance of a home for a long period of time should require a warrant.  04 December 2013 (Israel's plan to imprison asylum seekers)  Amnesty International criticizes Israel's plan to imprison asylum seekers.  04 December 2013 (Catholic hospitals in the US endanger womens' lives)  Catholic hospitals in the US endanger womens' lives rather than abort pregnancies.  Even more absurdly (I won't say "worse", since it isn't actually worse), they do this if the fetus is doomed anyway.  Hospitals should be required to provide all services including abortion, and if the Catholic Church doesn't like that, it should sell the hospitals.  04 December 2013 (Leader of protesters in Thailand)  The leader of protesters in Thailand demanded that six TV channels cease broadcasting government statements and broadcast only his side.  This suggests that these "protesters" think they have a lot of power behind them. This is not a popular protest movement even if it looks like one.  04 December 2013 (Tortured by US agents while held in a secret prison)  The European Court of Human Rights is considering the case of two prisoners in Guantanamo who accuse they were tortured in Poland by US agents while held in a secret prison.  The US does not allow these prisoners to testify. It should try them or release them. Maybe they are guilty of crimes, but so is the US in torturing them.  04 December 2013 (French team says Arafat was not poisoned)  A French team says Arafat was not poisoned, disagreeing with the Swiss team that found radioactive Polonium that implied he was murdered.  This disagreement begs for further investigation to discover the reason for it.  04 December 2013 (Netanyahu pretends Israel is going to attack Iran)  Netanyahu pretends Israel is going to attack Iran, so as to keep his supporters in the US Congress activated to sabotage the US-Iran nuclear treaty.  04 December 2013 (Israeli troops attacked foreign journalists)  Israeli troops attacked foreign journalists, shooting at their heads with rubber-coated steel bullets, and shooting them in the back.  This is not the first time Israeli soldiers have shot to kill and then denied it.  04 December 2013 (Families have trouble getting fuel for cooking, and water)  In Gaza, families have trouble getting fuel for cooking, and water.  04 December 2013 (Israeli forces used bulldozers to destroy wells in Palestine)  Israeli forces used bulldozers to destroy wells in Palestine. They also bulldozed tents that Palestinians lived in.  This is part of a long-term campaign of ethnic cleansing to evict Palestinians from a large slice of Palestine near the border with Jordan.  04 December 2013 (Alec lost 40 corporate sponsors after the killing of Trayvon Martin)  Alec lost 40 corporate sponsors after the killing of Trayvon Martin, but it is furiously planning how to get them back into a new organization with a different name.  One sponsor it has not lost yet is Google. Please sign the petition calling on Google to stop supporting Alec.  04 December 2013 (Australia arrested former official who was going to be a witness at the Hague)  Australia arrested a former official who was going to be a witness at the Hague, and raided his lawyer's office for legal documents.  The case concerns Australian spying during negotiations with East Timor for a treaty over fossil fuels. The witness was going to prove that Australia bugged the Timorese negotiating team. Apparently the current Australian government is so subservient to fossil fuel interests that it will trash traditional civil liberties for them.  The court should regard the witness's claims as proven conclusively by his arrest. That will serve the cause of justice in this case. Repairing the damage to civil liberties in Australia will take rather more.  04 December 2013 (Mark Duggan was surrendering when a thug shot him)  A witness says Mark Duggan was surrendering, with his hands up and a phone in his hand, when a thug shot him.  04 December 2013 (Google funds many right-wing campaigns in the US)  Google funds many right-wing campaigns in the US, including ALEC and tea party nut Senator Cruz, and "tax reform" that would tax the rich less.  03 December 2013 (Failure of the Warsaw climate negotiations)  Intense business lobbying &mdash; for false solutions or just against real ones &mdash; helped make the Warsaw climate negotiations a failure.  It's too bad the report uses the nebulous term "intellectual property". I suppose the companies reported on used that term, because the confusion it spreads serves their purposes; those who oppose them would do well to pull that veil aside.  03 December 2013 (Cuts in food stamps put families in trouble)  With cuts in food stamps, many families are in trouble if children are dismissed from school before lunch.  03 December 2013 (What 4C of global heating will mean for Australia)  A book spells out what 4C of global heating will mean for Australia &mdash; what it is going to experience if it does not join in cutting emissions.  03 December 2013 (Mood sweater)  A new sweater changes color depending on the wearer's feelings.  Imagine wearing this sweater while playing poker.  Now imagine hacking one to show whatever color you tell it color to show, and wearing it while playing poker.  03 December 2013 (Denmark offers child care to all young children)  Denmark offers child care to all young children, and it isn't overprotective.  American children used to organize their own play, too. They didn't need help from adults.  03 December 2013 (Caste Hindus attack Dalits with impunity)  Repeatedly, caste Hindus that attack Dalits in Bihar, India, are given impunity.  03 December 2013 (Measuring success by material things)  A study reports people who measure success by material things fall into a "loneliness loop" and then have trouble coping with reverses.  03 December 2013 (Urgent: Tax benefit for renewable energy projects)  US citizens: support the bill to allow renewable energy projects a sort of tax benefit available to fossil fuel projects.  For more info.  We should withdraw this form of public assistance for fossil fuel projects, because they must be discouraged.  03 December 2013 (Aging US nuclear plants kept open by reducing safety standards)  As US nuclear plants age, and various parts rust or become brittle, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission keeps the plants open by reducing safety standards over and over.  03 December 2013 (US pressure for Japan to continue using nuclear plants)  Nikkei Shimbun reported that US pressure for Japan to continue using nuclear power plants came from Obama himself.  I don't think we need to worry about occasionally eating seafood caught near Fukushima. The level of radioactive material in it is small compared with the radiation we are normally exposed to.  03 December 2013 (US gov't persistently treats journalists as terrorists)  The US government has a persistent habit of treating journalists as terrorists, and refused to promise not to prosecute journalist for publishing interviews with terrorists.  03 December 2013 (Legislative proposals being considered by ALEC)  ALEC is considering proposals to attack the rights of workers, patients, customers and students, vis-a-vis employers and businesses.  03 December 2013 (Small pieces of plastic harming sea life)  Small pieces of plastic in the ocean are harming worms that are food for many other species.  Pieces 5mm in size shouldn't be called "microplastics". Perhaps some pieces are small enough to deserve that name.  Once the worms have a low level of toxins, the animals that eat the worms will accumulate higher levels, and the animals that eat those will get even higher levels. The same thing happens with mercury, which is why tuna have so much mercury that they are dangerous for humans to eat.  03 December 2013 (Australia's digital spying agency)  Australia's digital spying agency offered to share raw, complete data about Australians with the US. This practice may have been directly illegal.  The agency discussed including medical and legal information too; whether it went ahead and did so is not stated.  03 December 2013 (Bashar al-Assad is tied directly to war crimes)  UN investigators say Bashar al-Assad is tied directly to war crimes.  I hope there is an investigation of what led to the armed uprising which supplanted the initial nonviolent protest movement. Was it funded by Saudi Arabia?  03 December 2013 (How massive surveillance affects us all)  How massive surveillance affects us all.  03 December 2013 (The Corporate Bully)  The Corporate Bully Whose Front Groups, Willful Distortions and Hate-Mongering Has Poisoned U.S. Politics.  03 December 2013 (Most Americans today consider other people untrustworthy)  Most Americans today consider other people untrustworthy. This has major effects.  Americans' purchases of gifts for their kids are part of overconsumption that endangers the world they will live in.  03 December 2013 (10-year moratorium on fracking)  Massachusetts is considering a 10-year moratorium on fracking.  A permanent ban would be safer.  03 December 2013 (Writer barred from US because she had been hospitalized for depression)  A Canadian writer was barred from the US because she had been hospitalized for depression. She wonders how the US found out about this &mdash; whether the Canadian government illegally gave her records to the US.  It is absurd for the US to bar people for depression. It is not communicable.  02 December 2013 (Removing DRM boosts sales of copies of music)  Research confirms that removing DRM boosts sales of copies of music, except for the biggest sellers, which are not affected at all.  Please don't call sharing "piracy"; it is propaganda for our enemies. A US judge, presiding over a trial for copyright infringement, recognized that "piracy" and "theft" are smear-words.  02 December 2013 (Programs that recognize facial expression)  A new threat to your privacy: programs to recognize facial expression.  If the program that recognizes expressions does not record the video, that doesn't make it ok. Indeed, another program might run at the same time to do that.  02 December 2013 (Leading scientists call for protection of forests and climate)  41 Leading Scientists Call on EPA to Protect Our Forests And Climate.  02 December 2013 (Population of migrating monarch butterflies plummets)  The population of migrating monarch butterflies has plummeted from 60 million last year (already a record low) to a few million.  This is because US agriculture has dropped conservation as a priority and switched to new pesticides.  02 December 2013 (US to sell more advanced weapons to Saudi Arabia)  The US plans to sell more advanced weapons to Saudi Arabia while Saudi Arabia arms Islamist fanatics in Syria.  Saudi Arabia also organized the repression in Bahrain.  02 December 2013 (Christian extremism correlates with global heating denialism)  Christian extremism correlates with global heating denialism.  02 December 2013 (Certain pesticides affect multiple generations of progeny of rats)  Exposing rats to certain pesticides can cause damage to their descendants 3 generations later.  02 December 2013 (Glossary for NSA massive surveillance)  A glossary for NSA massive surveillance.  02 December 2013 (Canada approves producing GMO salmon eggs in quantity)  Canada approved producing GMO salmon eggs in quantity.  I don't think it is likely these salmon would hurt people that eat them. Their danger is to wild salmon.  Maybe these are safe for the environment if raised in Panama. But fish eggs and young fish can drift a long way in the ocean. They would be much safer if they were engineered to be sterile. When there's a small chance of a big and irreparable harm, we need multiple lines of defense, each of which ought to be sufficient by itself.  02 December 2013 (Israel's position on the US-Iran deal)  Uri Avnery, regarding Israel's position on the US-Iran deal: "The fools would have been amusing, if they had not been our fools."  01 December 2013 (Urgent: Call on Walmart to pay a decent wage)  Everyone: call on Walmart to pay a decent wage.  01 December 2013 (Urgent: Block proposed giant oil terminal in Washington state)  Everyone: call on the governor of Washington to block a proposed giant oil terminal.  Shipping the oil, by train and ship, would endanger the Columbia River and cities including Spokane and Vancouver. Burning the oil would endanger everyone in the world.  01 December 2013 (Autonomous killer robots)  Current US robotics research turns out to be just what's needed for autonomous killer robots.  01 December 2013 (China's "drug rehabilitation" forced labor camps)  China's "re-education" forced labor camps have been changed into "drug rehabilitation" forced labor camps.  Most US prisoners had the option of a trial, though most get pressured into a plea bargain so they didn't have a trial. And the US puts a larger percentage of its population in prison than China does.  01 December 2013 (100,000 pro-EU protesters mobilize in Ukraine)  Repression of pro-EU protesters in Ukraine mobilized 100,000 of them.  The background for the protests in Ukraine.  01 December 2013 (Accusation of election fraud in Honduras)  Xiomara Castro accused election fraud in Honduras, which seems plausible given that 30% of the registered voters were invalid and that the difference between her percentage and the establishment candidate's percentage was less than 30%.  What did the exit polls say?  01 December 2013 (France punishing clients of prostitutes)  France has copied Sweden's harmful policy of punishing the clients of prostitutes.  I am not surprised that this law repression prostitution, but that is no help to those who choose (or might have chosen) to become prostitutes. It could discourage human trafficking that forces people to become prostitutes, but there are other ways to do that: (1) interviewing possibly trafficked immigrants in private in their own languages as they enter the country, (2) giving them advice on how to get help if they find they have been enslaved, and (3) visiting them once or twice a year for a private conversation to ask and check whether they have been enslaved.  It appears that these methods have not been tried.  Helping those who wish to leave prostitution is a good thing, but doesn't excuse the rest.  01 December 2013 (Anti-gov't rallies fighting with gov't supporters in Thailand)  In Thailand, anti-government mass rallies have started fighting with mass groups of government supporters.  The anti-government crowds have seized various government buildings, one after another.  01 December 2013 (Concealing published information from US readers)  Pretending a Name Is Still Secret &mdash; in the Name of the Cult of Secrecy.  01 December 2013 (Giant conglomerate buys 40,000 houses across the US)  A giant conglomerate, Blackstone, has bought 40,000 houses across the US, using money obtained from a wacky new financial instrument.  The housing subsidiary, "Invitation Homes", bullies renters for "late fees" when it makes a mistake collecting their rents. Many companies do this nowadays. It should be a felony to ask for any sort of extra fee from someone who has a contract for service.  If the new financial instrument goes belly-up, the company could fail. That could knock 40,000 US families out of their rented homes all at once.  01 December 2013 (The US gov't has been robbed)  Government in the US hasn't gone broke by spending too much. Rather, it has been robbed &mdash; by business.  01 December 2013 (Citizens charged with "unlawful assembly" in Papua New Guinea)  Visiting activists from West Papua were not arrested at the independence rally in Papua New Guinea, but three citizens of Papua New Guinea were charged with "unlawful assembly".  Charging anyone with "unlawful assembly" is a crime by the state. Of course, it is possible for protesters to do things which are properly prohibited. But assembling, as such, must not be prohibited.  01 December 2013 (Latin American countries working to end War on Drugs)  Several Latin American countries are working to make the UN accept ending the War on Drugs.  01 December 2013 (Company sues for trademark infringement in search engine)  The cosmetics company Lush, which refuses to sell through Amazon, has sued Amazon for trademark infringement because searching for "lush" there finds other products.  I sympathize with Lush's motivation, but I think it is wrong on this case. "Lush" is an English word and everyone has the right to use it as such. If Amazon's search facility searches for any English word, it would be wrong to ban this one as an exception. However, I see no harm in requiring Amazon to present a clear statement that these products are not made by Lush, and that Lush does not sell through Amazon.  In directory.fsf.org, if you search for names of nonfree programs, we don't show them (they don't qualify to be listed); instead we show their free counterparts. It would be unfortunate if we were banned from doing this.  I think Lush is more entitled to prevail in regard to Amazon's adwords articles.  The use of the vague term "intellectual property" where "trademark" would have been clearer added avoidable confusion to the article. See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html for why that term spreads confusion.  See stallman.org/amazon.html for many other reasons to refuse to buy from Amazon. See stallman.org/ebooks.pdf for why the Kindle and Kindle ebooks are an attack on your freedom.  01 December 2013 (UK attempts to deport hunger striker)  The UK attempted to suddenly deport Ifa Muaza before he could fast to death, but Nigeria did not allow the plane to land, so it brought him back to the UK.  "You proved your toughness at the expense of your humanity" &mdash; well said.  01 December 2013 (Another form of antibiotic-resistant bacteria found in poultry)  Another form of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has been found on poultry.  Even though this strain is not very dangerous to humans, the next one might be. Have we got our eyes shut towards dangerous business practices?  01 December 2013 (Venezuelan president given powers to legislate by decree)  The Venezuelan congress voted President Maduro powers to legislate by decree on economic matters.  This is in accord with the constitution, but that doesn't mean it is a good idea. Price controls tend to cause shortages, and Venezuela already has shortages. I feel no sympathy for store owners that gouge, but preventing future gouging requires changing the system that generates the gouging.  The corruption accusations against Asambleadora Aranguren are not inherently implausible, but this still seems fishy. The alleged corruption took place before she ran for election as a supporter of Chavez. However, the accusations were made in September 2013, after she had switched parties, and when her vote became inconvenient.  It is proper to take action against corrupt legislators, but it should be done in an unbiased way, not selectively based on their politics.  01 December 2013 (British Red Cross launches food drive for hungry Britons)  The British Red Cross is launching a food drive for hungry Britons, for the first time since World War II.  1/4 of the population has had trouble getting enough food this year, due to the poverty that the government has inflicted.  01 December 2013 (Behavior pattern in Canadian women helps men dominate them)  A behavior pattern found in Canadian women helps men dominate them.  The article errs when claiming the experiment described is proof that this behavior pattern is "hard-wired". The experiment does not tell us whether it is neurological or cultural.  01 December 2013 (UK gov't offers to abolish taxes meant for energy efficiency)  The UK government asked UK energy companies to keep prices stable for a while (through the next election) in exchange for the abolition of taxes meant to pay for energy efficiency.  In other words, the ruling parties want to give the public a short-term pleasure (cheap energy for the moment) in order to avoid investing in the country's future.  01 December 2013 (US hospitals' new trick to charge medicare patients more)  US hospitals have a new trick to charge medicare patients a lot more: put them on "observation" when they ought to be admitted as inpatients.  01 December 2013 (Judges say Berlusconi paid witnesses to lie in court)  Judges say Berlusconi paid witnesses to lie in court.  01 December 2013 (US bomb kills civilians in Afghanistan)  A US bomb killed civilians in Afghanistan, and Karzai demands greater efforts to avoid such casualties.  Accidentally hitting civilians is an inevitable part of war: bombs do miss, even despite the best attempts to hit the target. Thus, this event is not a war crime.  I wish, however, that the US made the best possible efforts to avoid killing civilians and that it owned up to civilian casualties when they occur. It does not.  01 December 2013 (Criminal charges against UK protester who called MP a "coward")  A protester in the UK faced criminal charges for calling the MP behind the anti-squatting law a "coward".  The fact that such charges could even be brought demonstrates that the UK does not respect freedom of speech.  I don't know whether that MP is a coward, but it is clear that he is cruel and chooses to make the poor suffer. Which, in my book, is much worse than being a coward.  01 December 2013 (Dominican Republic receives gay US ambassador)  The US sent the Dominican Republic an ambassador who is gay and in a same-sex marriage.  Around 20 years ago the US sent a black ambassador to South Africa, which was surely intended as rebuke to racism. I don't know whether this choice was meant as a rebuke to bigotry; it might be he was promoted due to merit and given the next available country.  In either case, now that religious bigots are demanding that the US accede to their bigotry, it must not do so. Bigotry is not the sort of "local custom" that deserves respect.  01 December 2013 (Nonfree software in cars)  The battery for the Zoe electric car has to be rented, and when the rental contract runs out, the battery can be disabled by remote control.  Cars are full of nonfree software, and it is common for nonfree software to be malware.  01 December 2013 (Public Citizen to sue Kleargear for ruining customers' credit ratings)  Public Citizen will sue on behalf of the customers whose credit rating was ruined when Kleargear "fined" them for publishing a criticism.  01 December 2013 (LA plans to ban giving food to homeless people from a truck)  Los Angeles finds homeless people unsightly and plans to ban giving them food from a truck.  If it bothers you that there are homeless people in your neighborhood, remember that their lives are much more unpleasant and dangerous than yours. The reason they look unsightly is that they don't have much money and they have no place to keep clothing while not wearing it. If they defecate in the street, they surely feel rather uncomfortable doing so, but they have no practical choice.  The excuses that these anticompassionate people give are full of holes so obvious you have to shut your eyes to fail to see them. If the neighborhood homeowners are annoyed that the homeless people don't have a proper place to defecate, they should set up a toilet. If they are annoyed that the homeless people sleep in the bushes, they should set up a camping space.  01 December 2013 (Contracts to German universities aimed at US weapons development)  US research contracts to German universities seem to be aimed at weapons development.  01 December 2013 (Pollution in the Ganges)  The Ganges is so polluted now that nobody can drink from it.  01 December 2013 (NSA obtains embarrassing information to discredit or blackmail people)  The NSA obtained embarrassing information against "radicalizers" so as to discredit or blackmail them.  If these techniques are applied to foreign enemies of the American nation, I could not criticize it. But they can just as well be applied to Americans, and to democratic political activists of other countries, at which point the practice resembles J. Edgar Hoover's blackmail (which focused on US politicians).  01 December 2013 (40% decrease in moose population in New Hampshire in 5 years)  Global heating has caused a 40% decrease in the moose population in New Hampshire in just 5 years.  They are not endangered yet, but with 30 more years of increased heat, maybe they will be.  01 December 2013 (Proposed African "cybersecurity" treaty)  A proposed African "cybersecurity" treaty could turn into censorship.  01 December 2013 (Amazon warehouse conditions could make illness more likely)  A stress expert, looking at an undercover report about an Amazon warehouse, says these conditions make physical and mental illness more likely.  30 November 2013 (Persistent, repeated harassment by thugs)  Alex Saleh installed a video camera in his store to protect his customers and staff from persistent, repeated harassment by thugs.  One of Saleh's employees was arrested 62 times for "trespassing" in Saleh's store.  30 November 2013 (Caught on video tasing a handcuffed prisoner)  A thug in Pennsylvania was caught on video tasing a handcuffed prisoner and laughing about it.  30 November 2013 (Protesters oppose Japan's new secrecy bill)  Protesters oppose Japan's new secrecy bill.  30 November 2013 (Urgent: Tell Walmart to give workers a raise)  Everyone: tell Walmart to give workers a raise.  30 November 2013 (Chinese business power has prevailed over the UK government)  Chinese business power has prevailed over the UK government, which will shun the Dalai Lama.  Politicians that approach international relations prioritizing exports over all else are despicable.  30 November 2013 (Ukraine's thugs attacked protesters)  Ukraine's thugs attacked protesters who object to the president's decision to align with Russia rather than the EU.  The government of Ukraine appears to be repressive, but rejecting the "trade" treaty may be wise. I have no information about what it says, but quite likely it contains unjust requirements, since that's normal for "trade" treaties.  30 November 2013 (Independence activist threatened with arrest)  An independence activist from West Papua has been threatened with arrest in neighboring Papua New Guinea for planning a peaceful protest for independence.  30 November 2013 (Soldiers sent to fight wars, then return to become thugs)  Soldiers sent to fight wars, then return to become thugs, may contribute to violence at home.  30 November 2013 (High School Student Tasered in School by Cop Is in a Coma)  High School Student Tasered in School by Cop Is in a Coma, Mother Says.  30 November 2013 (Microsoft's competitive staff ranking)  After the Gates Foundation pushed Microsoft's competitive staff ranking system on US public schools, Microsoft has abandoned it, concluding it was harmful to rank the staff.  I don't think the US politicians who imposed this system will regret it. They don't want public schools to achieve anything; they just want to spend less on them and destroy teachers' unions.  30 November 2013 (Boeing machinists voted down a contract with give-backs)  Boeing machinists voted down a contract with give-backs.  30 November 2013 (Technological "progress")  Technological "progress" now means more cunning tracking of people's purchases so as to offer different prices to different people.  30 November 2013 (In Afghanistan, the killers of journalists enjoy impunity)  In Afghanistan, the killers of journalists enjoy impunity.  30 November 2013 (EU should not allow personal data to be sent to US companies)  The EU should not allow personal data to be sent to US companies unless they follow a data protection regime as in the EU.  30 November 2013 (Canadian opposition politicians outraged by spying)  Canadian opposition politicians are outraged that Canada's spy agency, legally barred from spying in Canada, did such spying by outsourcing it to the NSA.  30 November 2013 (Several Egyptian activists have been arrested)  Several prominent Egyptian secular freedom activists have been arrested.  US law requires cutting off aid to the Egyptian military, as was pointed out in August. Will Obama continue to deny that there has been a military coup?  30 November 2013 (Women attacked with acid)  Two British women who went to Zanzibar to teach English as volunteers were attacked with acid, apparently by a stranger.  Since it seems the attacker did not know them personally and did not rob them, only an ideological motive remains. I suspect it was motivated by hostility to foreigners, or to women not dressed as strict Muslims.  30 November 2013 (Britons protested law criminalizing squatting)  Britons protested at a right-wing MP's office against the law criminalizing squatting, while the UK's empty buildings could house the country's homeless.  I'm delighted that this time the thugs did not intervene, as they so often do, on the side of the wealthy and against the downtrodden.  This cruelty contributes to the fast-rising housing prices.  30 November 2013 (Strict rules against electioneering by tax-exempt organizations)  Obama has proposed strict rules against electioneering by tax-exempt organizations. This is good because it will hinder the rich and corporations from contributing lots of money secretly to campaigns.  30 November 2013 (Portugal descended to even greater austerity measures)  Portugal has descended to even greater austerity measures.  The euro imposes a vicious circle: its rules require budget cuts to reduce the deficit, but these shrink the economy so tax receipts fall, and the deficit continues despite them.  Portugal's austerity is killing people.  30 November 2013 (ACLU sued to demand information about CIA's torture practices)  The ACLU has sued to demand publication of information about the CIA's torture practices.  30 November 2013 (Muslims try to impose their religion on everyone else)  Once again, Muslims try to impose their religion on everyone else &mdash; this time in Nigeria.  30 November 2013 (Fertilizer runoff does great harm to coral)  An experiment shows that fertilizer runoff does great harm to coral, and that the coral can recover quickly if the fertilizer runoff stops.  30 November 2013 (Planning to "survive" by causing more global heating)  A port in Canada says it plans to "survive" by taking advantage of global heating to bring oil in by train for export, thus causing more global heating. How narrowminded. This attitude, "We are going to 'survive' (i.e., maintain our business) by killing people elsewhere", is why the world does nothing to escape disaster.  The trains will from time to time explode and kill people.  This is the sort of behavior that should lead the rest of the world to forcibly stop it.  30 November 2013 (Execution by stoning as a penalty for adultery)  Karzai says Afghanistan will not use execution by stoning as a penalty for adultery.  What will Afghanistan do to people who have sex outside marriage? Something else almost as nasty?  30 November 2013 (Businesses spying on activists)  Businesses spying on activists can buy the support of the FBI and CIA for their War on Democracy, which in many cases is part of their War on the Ecosphere.  30 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose "trade" treaties that give businesses more power)  US citizens: oppose "trade" treaties that give businesses more power.  30 November 2013 (A panel controlled by the lumber industry)  A panel to propose ways to protect the Australian endangered Leadbeater's possum is controlled by the lumber industry, and refuses to consider any serious plan to protect their habitat.  30 November 2013 (Attempt to sue Apple failed)  An attempt to sue Apple for designing the iThings so that apps could easily snoop on the user failed because the requirements for winning are so strict that it would be almost impossible to meet them.  What this shows is that the US lacks proper privacy law.  30 November 2013 (Arrested for posting a parody video)  People in Dubai have been arrested for posting a parody video and for posting a video of a man battering another on a bus.  This policy is one reason why I absolutely refuse to go to Dubai.  In the US, you might get arrested for making a video of an attack, if the attacker is a thug. And even in that case, you can probably prevail in court.  30 November 2013 (US military manipulates news coverage of wars)  The US military manipulates news coverage of wars, and turns movies into war propaganda, with devastating effects on politics.  30 November 2013 (Increased drought and fire in the western US)  Research suggests that deforestation in Amazonia will contribute cause increased drought and fire in the western US.  Global heating is making the western US dry out anyway, but since it also threatens to dry out Amazonia, this will mean even more aridity there.  30 November 2013 (FBI Antisec group)  Jeremy Hammond believes that the FBI was running the Antisec group to crack security of systems around the world for the FBI's sake.  30 November 2013 (Use of the DMCA for censorship)  WordPress joined two bloggers to sue over use of the DMCA for censorship.  29 November 2013 (Urgent: Endorse deal with Iran)  US citizens: call on Hillary Clinton to endorse the deal with Iran.  28 November 2013 (Possible prosecution of Julian Assange)  Regarding the possible prosecution of Julian Assange, the Obama regime is trying to have it both ways: on the one hand, spreading rumors that Assange is "unlikely" to be prosecuted; on the other, keeping the prosecution option open.  The nastiest part is when people condemn Assange for prudently refusing to bet the rest of his life on the truth these rumors.  28 November 2013 (UK Internet censorship will cover some political views)  UK Internet censorship will cover some political views.  I don't like those views much either, but freedom of speech means the freedom to say things that you and I and the UK government don't like.  I wonder how long it will take before the UK blocks access to stallman.org.  28 November 2013 (Alexis Tsipras will run for president of European Commission)  Alexis Tsipras, head of the anti-austerity Greek opposition, will run for president of the European Commission to galvanize opposition to austerity across Europe.  28 November 2013 ("Bedroom tax" is an excuse to squeeze the poor)  The UK's clever "bedroom tax" is supposed to make people move to smaller apartments, but no smaller apartments are available, so it really amounts to an excuse to squeeze the poor.  Someone has to suffer to enable banksters to take home more pay.  28 November 2013 (Journalist Kostas Vaxevanis acquitted)  Greek journalist Kostas Vaxevanis, prosecuted for publishing a list of suspected tax evaders, has been acquitted.  28 November 2013 (Requirement for ID to connect to the Internet)  A broad coalition opposes the requirement to demand ID from everyone that connects to the Internet in Ecuador.  The wording of the law would require you to record the ID and make a video even if you let someone use your network at home. I campaigned against this measure when I was in Ecuador in October.  But this is the first I heard that Peru had adopted this nasty law. I will have to think twice before going there again.  28 November 2013 (The absurdity of considering human rights for companies)  The Supreme Court plans to consider a case in which a company's owners claim that paying for health care that covers birth control violates their religious freedom.  I fear that this Supreme Court will rule for that company. It has granted companies absurd "human" rights on other questions.  28 November 2013 (Belgium on track to approve voluntary euthanasia with no age limit)  Belgium is on track to approve voluntary euthanasia with no age limit.  I am in favor of this. The safeguards must be quite careful so that children are not pressured into a decision they are not sure they want.  If we can allow minors the choice of dying, it is ridiculous to deny them the far less drastic choice of having sex. That too should be permitted, with suitable safeguards; for instance, that the minor would declare in advance an intention to start having sex.  28 November 2013 (Berlusconi ousted from Italian senate)  Berlusconi has been ousted from the Italian senate because of his criminal convictions.  28 November 2013 (EU demands that US stop spying massively)  The EU demands that the US stop spying massively if it wants US companies to hold data on business in Europe.  This not strong enough, however.  28 November 2013 (Problems of privately financed public parks)  On the problems of building public parks based on tax-deductible donations from the rich.  If we taxed them enough, we would not have this problem.  28 November 2013 (Pope Francis calls for action on income inequality)  Pope Francis condemned trickle-down economics and the greed of the plutocrats, and called for action on income inequality.  As a supporter of this cause for many years, I welcome this additional support.  28 November 2013 (79 Egyptian secular dissidents arrested)  79 Egyptian secular dissidents have been arrested under the new ban on protests.  Ever since the massacres of Morsi supporters protesting on the street, it has increasingly appeared that the military was taking Egypt towards another military dictatorship.  28 November 2013 (Polar bear populations in Canada falling)  Polar bear populations in Canada are falling due to the effects of global heating, but the minister in charge is a global heating denier.  28 November 2013 (The Real Fix for Obamacare's Flaws)  The Real Fix for Obamacare's Flaws: Medicare for All.  28 November 2013 (Urgent: A farm bill that protects wildlife)  US citizens: call your congresscritter to pass a farm bill that protects wildlife.  Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641, and 888-355-3588.  28 November 2013 (Urgent: Rebuke Kmart for ordering workers to work during Thanksgiving)  In the US (or any country where Kmart operates): rebuke Kmart for ordering workers to work during Thanksgiving.  28 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose approval of genetically modified apples)  US citizens: call on the USDA not to approve genetically modified apples.  28 November 2013 (Investigations into massacre repeatedly blocked by UK gov't)  The UK government has repeatedly blocked investigations into a massacre of Malay civilians by British soldiers.  28 November 2013 (Small businesses forced into bankruptcy by RBS bank)  It appears the RBS bank forced small businesses into bankruptcy to buy up their assets.  This is a natural result of the culture of competing to be less ethical than the other banks.  Larger banks are doing the same thing to states, most notably Greece but many others too.  28 November 2013 (Companies had special access to Warsaw global heating negotiations)  The Polish government gave 11 companies special access to the ineffective Warsaw global heating negotiations, including some that lobby furiously to keep burning fossil fuels.  The "ETS" is the emissions trading system, which was meant to pressure industry to reduce emissions, but has fallen flat on its face.  28 November 2013 (How the NSA Slipped its Leash)  PR Watch: Return to Nixonland: How the NSA Slipped its Leash.  28 November 2013 (Investigation into assassination of Alexander Litvinenko silenced)  The UK government has finally silenced the investigation into the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko.  28 November 2013 (Dictator of Angola regularly kills dissidents)  The dictator of Angola regularly has dissidents shot, or feeds them to crocodiles, but since he controls lots of oil, he buys international support.  28 November 2013 (Journalists attacked in Bangkok)  Anti-Shinawatra protesters in Bangkok have attacked journalists they consider unsympathetic to their cause.  These protesters do not represent the majority, but seem to be an influential minority.  28 November 2013 (Using Interpol's system to catch dissidents and refugees)  Interpol's system is used by repressive regimes to catch dissidents and refugees.  28 November 2013 (Selling the destruction of parts of nature)  Putting a financial value on parts of nature invites companies to pay that much to destroy them.  28 November 2013 (Drone Weapons)  The US, in pushing development drone weapons, is  failing to consider what will result when its enemies have drones too.  28 November 2013 (Help Real Children)  Rather than censorship,  the way to end abuse of real children is with social workers that help real children.  Since poverty often brings out the worst in people, ending austerity would help a lot too.  28 November 2013 (Rainforest in Sumatra)  A road planned to go through a rainforest in Sumatra, for coal export,  could wipe out many endangered species.  27 November 2013 (Urgent: Tell Google to stop supporting ALEC)  Everyone: tell Google to stop supporting ALEC.  ALEC is a right-wing scheme by which businesses twist state legislators to pass the bills those businesses want.  27 November 2013 (Urgent: Rebuke US Airways)  Everyone: rebuke US Airways for kicking a blind man and service dog off a flight.  If you've flown a while, you know that flight crew can act like little tyrants when they take it into their heads to push passengers around, and that when they say he was "disruptive", that is an exaggerated way to say "He talked back to us."  27 November 2013 (Ukraine's deal with the EU)  IMF harshness helped spike Ukraine's deal with the EU.  27 November 2013 (Corporate front groups)  How a Shadowy Network of Corporate Front Groups Distorts the Marketplace of Ideas.  27 November 2013 (An iPad on Every Desk: A Trojan Horse)  An iPad on Every Desk: A Trojan Horse, Teachers Say.  They don't realize this is true in the computing sense too.  27 November 2013 (Corporate espionage undermines democracy)  Ralph Nader: Corporate espionage undermines democracy.  27 November 2013 (Pressure in Wall Street to deceive customers)  A former Wall Street mathematician describes how his job was to invent complex financial instruments so as to dupe customers, and all managers participated in the pressure to be more deceptive than the competition.  27 November 2013 (Proposed cuts to US food assistance)  Proposed cuts to US food assistance will cancel out all voluntary food donations to the poor.  27 November 2013 (Anti-protest laws threaten democracy)  From Quebec to Spain, anti-protest laws are threatening true democracy.  The more government becomes a mechanism for control by the plutocrats, the less it can tolerate protest or democracy.  27 November 2013 (French couple's manifesto for legalization of choice to die)  A French couple, age 86, committed suicide together, leaving behind a manifesto for legalization of the choice to die.  27 November 2013 (Assad to negotiate with his Syrian enemies)  Assad and his Syrian enemies will have negotiations.  It will not be easy to find anything they can agree on. Meanwhile, the goal of the original protesters, a secular democracy, has been completely ruined by Assad and Saudi proxies.  27 November 2013 (Lavender crop in France wiped out)  Global heating has encouraged an insect pest to wipe out the lavender crop in France.  27 November 2013 (Pointless consumption)  The wealthier the country, the less its people care how they treat the natural world &mdash; perhaps because of the industry of pointless consumption.  27 November 2013 (Common Excuses for NSA Mass Surveillance)  Busting Eight Common Excuses for NSA Mass Surveillance.  When you decide to help fight against massive surveillance, remember that we need to go beyond limiting the state's access to the data companies collect. We need to reduce the accumulation of data about everyone.  27 November 2013 (Biofuels made from food crops)  Biofuels made from food crops are a "crime against humanity".  27 November 2013 (Thug proved to have lied)  A thug who is proved to have lied, claiming he heard Andrew Mitchell call another thug a "pleb", will face prosecution.  Thugs often lie to put someone in the wrong; they think they are privileged to do so. I am glad that they get prosecuted when they do this to a powerful politician. I wish they got prosecuted when they do this to other people.  27 November 2013 (Corporate lobbying sabotaged negotiations to curb global heating)  The world media don't mention the massive corporate lobbying effort that has sabotaged negotiations that were supposed to curb global heating.  27 November 2013 (US banks threaten to charge for savings accounts)  US banks threaten to charge for savings accounts because interest rates are so low.  Why are they so low? To promote "economic growth" of the sort that benefits companies but not workers. The effective way to promote true economic growth is with deficit spending, but Republicans have blocked this since 2010, so the Federal Reserve uses "quantitative easing" as a substitute that doesn't quite work.  27 November 2013 (Global heating refugee denied asylum)  Ioane Teitiota, from Kiribati, was denied asylum in New Zealand as a global heating refugee.  He asked for asylum because his home is certain to become uninhabitable due to rising sea level. The court denies the danger. It is clear that he is probably safe in Kiribati this year and next year. It is equally clear that they will be inundated.  Reportedly growth of coral is enlarging some of the islands at present. However, in a few decades the coral will be killed by ocean acidification, and the islands won't be able to grow after that.  Will people be accepted as climate refugees when inundation gets closer?  What about the millions who live at low elevations in Bangladesh?  27 November 2013 (Urgent: Reject the TPP)  Everyone: call on world leaders to reject the TPP.  27 November 2013 (Prisoners in Guantanamo)  Prisoners in Guantanamo can get out, if they have strong enough al Qa'ida ties, by turning informer. On the other hand, if you were captured for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you may never get out.  I have no objection to infiltrating al Qa'ida. Unlike the dissident movements that the thugs usually infiltrate, al Qa'ida supports neither human rights nor democracy. What does bother me is that this might be part of the motive for the oppressive practice of imprisoning people indefinitely without a trial.  27 November 2013 (NSA employs over 1000 crackers)  The NSA employs over 1000 crackers and has infected over 50,000 computer networks with malware to be activated later.  (Please don't use "hackers" to mean "people who break security".)  On Hacking  27 November 2013 (Poverty in the US)  Poverty in the US is not only painful, it is deadly.  26 November 2013 (Driver faces charges of driving car with secret compartment)  A driver in Ohio faces charges of driving a car which has a secret compartment in it. They simply assume his intent was to smuggle drugs.  26 November 2013 (UK gov't wiped out offshore windfarm project)  The UK government wiped out a large offshore windfarm project by talking about cancelling previously promised subsidies.  I don't think this is a stumble, and I don't think the UK government's ambitions run in the green direction at all. It has given plenty of signs that it is subservient to the fossil fuel companies. I think it did this to keep fossil fuel use high.  26 November 2013 (Each year more species are under threat)  Despite success of efforts to protect some endangered species, each year more species are under threat.  26 November 2013 (UK visa law)  UK visa law leads directly to slavery for immigrant domestic workers.  Why pass a law that is so obviously unjust? Who would ask for such a law? Evidently the people wealthy enough to employ live-in servants. In other words, plutocrats legalized domestic slavery in the UK.  26 November 2013 (Deaths from AIDS)  Deaths from AIDS have gone down, except in teenagers.  I have a hunch that prudish attitudes contribute to this.  26 November 2013 (Very urgent: Support Walmart workers protests' on Nov 29)  Everyone: support Walmart workers' protests on Nov 29, and pledge to boycott Walmart on Nov 29.  25 November 2013 (Urgent: Support the Affordable Care Act)  US citizens: sign this petition in support of the Affordable Care Act.  25 November 2013 (Urgent: Say no to trusting Transcanada to avoid oil spills)  US citizens: say no to trusting Transcanada to avoid oil spills on the Keystone XL pipeline notwithstanding its horrible maintenance record.  25 November 2013 (Urgent: Support diplomacy with Iran)  US citizens: support diplomacy with Iran.  25 November 2013 (NAFTA and US Farmers &mdash; 20 Years Later)  NAFTA and US Farmers &mdash; 20 Years Later.  25 November 2013 (New passport)  I just got a new passport. It came with a brochure whose front page says, "With Your U.S. Passport, the World Is Yours."  What a claim!  25 November 2013 (Nonviolent protesters face charges carrying a year in prison)  Nonviolent protesters against the JP Morgan Chase bank face charges in the US carrying a year in prison.  Their protest criticized the company for bankrolling massive environmental damage that is going to kill thousands, maybe millions of people. Of the forecast of a hundred million human casualties from global heating by 2030, to be followed by larger numbers afterward, surely JP Morgan Chase will be responsible for at least 1%.  We see increased repression of environmental protesters, in the US as in Russia. I predict it will increase steadily, because the fossil fuel companies will demand ever more repression to keep a lid on the people who see the current system is going to kill them.  25 November 2013 (High and stable carbon price needed to avert disaster)  A high and stable carbon price is needed to avert disaster.  I will go further and assert that this must be implemented via a carbon tax. A cap-and-trade system is easy to game.  25 November 2013 (Myths about retail jobs)  Correcting myths about retail jobs.  Now imagine what these people will do if they are replaced by automated sales machines. Beg on the street? That is why I refuse to use those machines, and call on other customers to refuse too.  Technology is not the main cause of increased poverty in the US. Mostly it is due to policies that favor the rich.  Nonetheless, eliminating millions of jobs through technology will add to the problem. The US does not need more efficiency, it needs to support everyone better.  25 November 2013 (Antibiotic-resistant bladder infections)  Antibiotic-resistant bladder infections are linked to bacteria found in chicken treated with antibiotics.  We must end the regular use of antibiotics in farm animals, and if the result is to make meat more expensive, we'll probably eat a more healthful diet.  25 November 2013 (How Economic Growth Has Become Anti-Life)  Vandada Shiva: How Economic Growth Has Become Anti-Life.  25 November 2013 (Nothing achieved at Warsaw climate summit)  The Warsaw climate summit achieved little except to decide to decide on something later. If indeed they do so.  25 November 2013 (Afghan gov't plans to bring back stoning and flogging)  The Afghan government plans to bring back stoning (a form of execution) and flogging as punishments for adultery.  I supported the intervention in Afghanistan to end the Taliban's oppression of women, but it has been creeping back for years, and accelerating recently.  25 November 2013 (Revenge porn)  A crusader writes about her experience fighting and defeating a revenge porn site.  Revenge porn achieves its intended effect because of a neurotic taboo against nudity. Why fire someone for making a nude photo that gets posted by someone else? Why fire someone for making a nude photo and intentionally posting it? Why fire someone for stripping in a bar, or in Central Park? It is all gratuitous cruelty, and that cruelty makes Moore's cruelty possible. In effect, his activities are part of the harm done by the taboo.  We could make it illegal to fire people such as Jill the teacher. That would be better than nothing. However, the real solution is not at the legal level. Rather, we need to get over the nudity taboo, so that nobody thinks of firing such people.  Facebook could do something good for society (for a change) if it required each of its users to post a nude selfie. After a few months of that, revenge porn would no longer succeed in bothering anyone. Victims would say, "Oh, you're going to post another nude photo of me? Please tell me the URL so I can link to it." The Hunter Moores of the world would have to search for some other way to harass people.  The wrong of the taboo does not excuse revenge porn &mdash; or any company that argues, "What we're doing is lawful, and you can't criticize us for anything that's lawful and profitable." Yes we can! That the nastiness is lawful is no excuse, ethically. In general, someone who exploits a flaw in a system to hurt people is responsible for his actions, and the system is also responsible if it could be better.  25 November 2013 (United Airlines wants confidentiality agreement after nearly killing passenger's dog)  United Airlines, after nearly killing a woman's dog, offered to pay the vet bill, but only if she signs a confidentiality agreement.  I flew on United a few days ago. Before the usual safety announcement there was an ad showing staff (or perhaps actors) talking about how good service was their priority. I didn't pay it much attention, but it occurred to me for a moment to think, "Don't tell us &mdash; show us!"  I think there should be a law invalidating any confidentiality commitment made to a business by a client.  25 November 2013 (New Pun)  New Pun - sushi.  25 November 2013 (Why We Need A State)  Why We Need A State  25 November 2013 (Urgent: Support a basic income for all citizens)  US citizens: support a basic income for all citizens.  25 November 2013 (Antibiotic-resistant bacteria in turkey meat)  Feeding antibiotics to turkeys has led to antibiotic-resistant bacteria in turkey meat.  25 November 2013 (Unfinished spy feature in LG Smart TV to be removed)  LG said its Smart TV was sending back filenames found on USB drives as part of an unfinished feature to search for other things "you might also like".  We are fortunate it was not finished, or they would have presented it as a reason not to remove the feature.  25 November 2013 (Egypt's military-controlled gov't bans protests)  Egypt's military-controlled government has banned protests (without special permission).  25 November 2013 (Poverty makes it hard to do things perceived to be easy)  A poor person in the US explains how poverty makes it hard and expensive to do things middle class people think ought to be easy and cheap.  25 November 2013 (Urgent efforts needed to protect Great Barrier Reef)  Urgent efforts are needed to protect the Great Barrier Reef.  Part of the urgent effort Australia must make is to extract less coal.  25 November 2013 (The carbon bubble)  Companies with valuations based on the carbon bubble must warn investors.  24 November 2013 (Anti-drone activists acquitted of charges)  Anti-drone activists who protested at Hancock Air Force Base were acquitted of charges after demonstrating they were actually helping the US to follow the constitution.  24 November 2013 (Interim agreement limiting Iran's uranium enrichment)  The US and Iran have made an interim agreement limiting Iran's uranium enrichment.  The deal calls for diluting Iran's 20%-enriched uranium, which would put any possible nuclear weapon further away.  Netanyahu hates this deal, for understandable reasons: it will deny him the chance to get the US and Iran into war, and he will no longer be able to cite Iran to distract attention from the occupation of Palestine.  24 November 2013 (Repression that theocratic Christians want to impose on homosexuals)  Uganda illustrates the repression that theocratic Christians want to impose on homosexuals everywhere, including in the US.  24 November 2013 (Iron age hill fort of Oswestry will be covered by new housing)  Thanks to the UK's deregulation of planning, the iron age hill fort of Oswestry will be covered by new housing.  24 November 2013 (UK took charity funds and spent it on Olympic Park)  The UK took money from funds for normally local charities and spent it on the Olympic Park. At the time, the government promised to make up the loss, but it seems to be breaking that promise.  The Olympic Games leave behind debt, surveillance and repression; if there is a proposal to hold them in your city, organize now to push them away.  24 November 2013 (South African thugs who massacred striking miners)  There is evidence that the South African thugs who massacred striking miners had met with the mine management and made a plan to break the strike. This was designed to promote an ANC-associated union and block the acceptance of an independent and more vigorous union.  I don't think the ANC has done anything good since Nelson Mandela ceased to be president.  24 November 2013 (Azerbaijan corrupts UK MPs)  An "independent" organization run by a relative of a minister of Azerbaijan corrupts UK MPs with expensive vacations and parties.  24 November 2013 (Floating windfarms)  Floating windfarms are cheaper and can be located further away from the shore.  24 November 2013 (Politico's "Playbook")  The sponsors of Politico's "Playbook" seem to get favorable "news" coverage there that agrees with their ads.  24 November 2013 (Sued for posting official German safety standards)  Carl Malamud is being sued for posting official German safety standards, which the state is charging substantial amounts to see.  24 November 2013 (Censorship at London School of Economics)  Two students at the London School of Economics sold atheist and secularist books while wearing Jesus and Mo shirts, and met with censorship from the university and the student union.  I think the article generalizes too far about leftist students; I am sure many of them are not inclined to support such censorship.  24 November 2013 (Registered voters in Kansas blocked from voting)  Many registered voters in Kansas have been blocked from voting in state elections.  24 November 2013 (40% of workers for US businesses get no sick days)  40% of workers for US businesses get no sick days and can be fired if they miss a day of work for getting sick.  Bills are being considered in 10 states to ban cities from taking steps to protect workers from this.  The US government is a government of occupation on behalf of the plutocrats.  24 November 2013 (China uses pandas as bargaining chips)  China lends pandas to countries as bargaining chips for dirty trade deals.  24 November 2013 (Obama has shut out almost all press photographers)  Obama has shut out press photographers almost 100%.  24 November 2013 (Syrian refugees subject to iris scanning biometric ID)  Aid for Syrian refugees is serving as a test platform for iris scanning biometric ID, which is almost compulsory for them.  24 November 2013 (Internet freedom in India under attack)  Internet freedom in India is under attack from all directions.  24 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose GMO salmon)  US citizens: tell the FDA not to approve GMO salmon.  These fish could cause harm to wild salmon.  24 November 2013 (NSA strategy to collect even more data about everyone)  With all the massive surveillance it does, the NSA was not satisfied. In 2012 it established a strategy to collect even more data about everyone.  24 November 2013 (Newly freed slaves get invited to more subtle form of submission)  Three women released from 30 years of slavery in a house in London were shown an iPad, inviting them to enter into a more subtle form of submission.  24 November 2013 (Greenpeace protester says prison won't make him regret protest)  Greenpeace protester Anthony Perrett says that if Russia imprisons him he will not regret his protest.  The activists freed on bail must be glad, but if they talk by Skype, another regime is surveilling them.  24 November 2013 (Residents of Lafourche vote to fund libraries instead of new jail)  The residents of Lafourche Parish voted to fund libraries rather than a new jail.  The ebooks they are talking about are, apparently, commercial. It is a shame that these libraries promote commercial ebooks. They should reject those on ethical grounds.  Lafourche county's existing jail would be perfectly adequate if they stop fighting the War on Drugs.  24 November 2013 (Hawaii legislator boasts of crushing the belongings of homeless people)  Hawaii legislator Tom Brower boasts of crushing the belongings of unsightly homeless people.  People who are hungry in the midst of plenty of food are morally entitled to steal food. And if Brower doesn't like their use of shopping baskets to carry around their few possessions, he should provide them with some other way to store those.  24 November 2013 (Toxic lakes of waste water from tar sands oil extraction)  Oil companies plan to create enormous toxic lakes full of waste water from tar sands oil extraction.  There is no way of knowing how far the toxins will spread. At low temperatures they may degrade especially slowly. (Toxic metals last forever, unless they happen to be radioactive.)  If the cost of proper disposal of these toxins were included in the cost of that oil, it would be so expensive that nobody would buy it today.  24 November 2013 (US Chamber of Commerce Attempting to Undermine Anti-Bribery Law)  U.S. Chamber of Commerce Attempting to Undermine Anti-Bribery Law, Public Citizen Report Shows.  24 November 2013 (Commercial use of face recognition)  Senator Franken asks for a federal investigation of commercial use of face recognition.  I think this is a positive step, but what we really need to investigate, and limit, is the use of face recognition by the government, and its ability to collect images to recognize.  24 November 2013 (House committee rejects greater accountability for drone attacks)  A House committee rejected a small step towards greater accountability for civilian casualties of drone attacks.  23 November 2013 (UK students from poor families will suffer from new budget cuts)  Half a million UK students from poor families will suffer from a new budget cut.  This and more austerity in the UK stem from subservience to businesses that want to extract money from the country and pay little tax.  Corporations claim US taxes are too high. Here's how that is a lie.  23 November 2013 (Boycott of the Olympic Games in Russia)  Nadia Tolokonnikova endorses the boycott of the Olympic Games in Russia.  23 November 2013 (Urgent: Protect some species of bats that face the danger of extinction)  US citizens: call on the Fish and Wildlife Service to protect some species of bats that face the danger of extinction from white-nose fungus.  23 November 2013 (Urgent: Accurate and non-prudish sex education)  Citizens of Massachusetts: call for accurate and non-prudish sex education.  23 November 2013 (Corporate Espionage and the Secret War Against Citizen Activism)  Corporate Espionage and the Secret War Against Citizen Activism.  Companies implicated include Walmart, Monsanto, Bank of America, Dow Chemical, Kraft, Coca-Cola, Chevron, Burger King, McDonald  23 November 2013 (Congressman votes for harsh punishments for drug users other than himself)  A Republican Congressman will be sentenced to probation for buying cocaine, which he called a "disease" in his own case, but he voted to impose drug tests on Americans that get food stamps and for punishing them harshly.  23 November 2013 (Thousands Protest in Japan against New State Secrets Bill)  Thousands Protest in Japan against New State Secrets Bill, which would punish whistleblowers severely.  There a world-wide wave of increasing government surveillance and secrecy power, as various governments preemptively attack human rights and democracy before the movement builds up to defend them.  23 November 2013 (FBI acts as buffer between Internet company staff and NSA)  The FBI acts as a buffer to keep Internet company staff unaware that they are working for the NSA.  23 November 2013 (EU proposes to ban sale of unregistered seed varieties)  The EU proposes to ban sale of unregistered seed varieties. Registration is so expensive that many varieties (especially for home gardeners) will disappear, along with the small seed companies that sell them.  23 November 2013 (Asylum seeker fasting to death in UK prison)  Isa Muazu is fasting to death in prison in the UK rather than return to Nigeria.  I don't know whether Muazu has a valid claim for asylum &mdash; in particular, this article does not show whether he has a real reason to fear being attacked by Boko Haram. However, a system that is rigged so that people with a valid claim can't prove it is prima facie unjust.  23 November 2013 (Supreme Court allows law designed to make abortion unavailable)  The Supreme Court allowed a Texas law to take effect, which imposes restrictions on abortion designed for no reason except to make it unavailable.  This is not a final decision about the law's constitutionality; that remains to be considered. But it seems to imply the court is considering declaring it constitutional.  In effect, the right-wing US Supreme Court has found a way to negate the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, by allowing states to ban it indirectly.  23 November 2013 (Automated virus synthesizer)  If you think 3D-printed guns are dangerous, consider an automated virus synthesizer.  23 November 2013 (Healthcare.gov contractor making lots of money from doing bad job)  The contractor responsible for the failing Healthcare.gov site is making lots of money from doing a bad job.  I suspect this is because the system was delivered to the US as nonfree software so that no other company could even try to fix it.  23 November 2013 (Tony Blair let NSA spy on millions of UK citizens)  Tony Blair let the American NSA Spy on Millions of Britons and Store their Private Data.  Here's more detail of what the UK allows the NSA to do to UK citizens.  23 November 2013 (Problems with breeder reactors)  CNN broadcast a misleading and one-sided pitch for breeder reactors. Here are the problems that it did not mention.  23 November 2013 (People killed for no apparent reason in Central African Republic)  A militia or militias have taken over the Central African Republic and kill helpless people for no obvious reason.  23 November 2013 (Google might be able to smash Chinese internet censorship)  Google might be able to smash Chinese internet censorship, if it dares try.  23 November 2013 (PM Cameron calls investment in renewable energy "green crap")  Prime Minister Cameron privately called investment in renewable energy "green crap".  23 November 2013 (Russia threatens economic warfare against Ukraine)  Russia threatened economic warfare against Ukraine to make Ukraine break off plans for a closer trade relationship with the EU.  Russia is not alone in this. The US uses threats of economic warfare to bully countries into imposing anti-sharing laws that repress their citizens.  23 November 2013 (Walmart workers to protest through "black Friday")  Walmart workers plan protests now through "black Friday", Nov 29.  23 November 2013 (Ironic history of decades of war in Afghanistan)  The ironic history of decades of war in Afghanistan.  How the inhabitants see the US today.  The latter article refers to the former for the claim that the Mujahedeen were ideologically united with the Communists by hatred for the US, but I can't see any sign of that in the former article.  23 November 2013 (Urgent: Change YouTube policies)  Everyone: call on Google to change YouTube policies to prevent people from sabotaging a channel via false complaints of copyright infringement.  23 November 2013 (Urgent: Regulation of fracking on public land)  US citizens: call on your senators to oppose Senator Hatch's bill that would ban regulation of fracking on public lands.  23 November 2013 (UN resolution affirming privacy rights)  The US, UK and Australia failed in the attempt to undermine and sabotage a UN resolution affirming privacy rights.  23 November 2013 (Detectives try to protect quarterback from charges of rape)  When a woman accused a Florida State University quarterback of rape, detectives tried to protect him and pressure her to drop the charges.  22 November 2013 (Urgent: Support Green Party's budget approach)  US citizens: support the Green Party's budget approach.  22 November 2013 (Decriminalizing file-sharing)  European Parliament Members Explore Decriminalizing File-Sharing.  22 November 2013 (Spain to impose heavy fines on protesters)  Spain's right-wing austerity government plans to impose heavy fines on protesters, without trial.  You can send your images of Spanish thugs to me; I will find a way to publish them.  22 November 2013 (The Insanity of Our Food Policy)  Joseph Stiglitz: The Insanity of Our Food Policy.  22 November 2013 (US Senate abolishes filibusters for presidential nominees)  The US Senate has abolished filibusters for presidential nominees.  This will put an end to one form of systematic Republican obstructionism: blocking all Democratic appointments, not bothering to judge them individually.  22 November 2013 (Corporate sponsorship of UN client negotiations)  The UN client negotiations now have corporate sponsors, in effect corrupting the negotiations directly in addition to the older indirect corruption through governments.  22 November 2013 (Irish women ask UN to denounce restrictive abortion law)  Irish women asked the UN to denounce Ireland's restrictive abortion law.  Nicaragua's is even worse.  22 November 2013 (UK thugs use blackmail and bribery to recruit informers)  UK thugs use blackmail and bribery to recruit informers in activist groups.  22 November 2013 (Kuwait: 5 Years for Tweet 'Insulting' Prophet)  Kuwait: 5 Years for Tweet 'Insulting' Prophet.  21 November 2013 (India's greatest hero of freedom and justice)  India's greatest hero of freedom and justice, Dr. Ambedkar, tends to be ignored by upper-caste Hindus.  21 November 2013 (Norwegian ministers say NSA lied to them)  Norwegian ministers say the NSA falsely told them it wasn't doing massive surveillance of activities of Norwegians.  21 November 2013 (Sweden to give thugs unlimited power to tap phone and email)  Sweden plans to give thugs and various agencies unlimited and unchecked power to tap any and all phone calls and emails.  21 November 2013 (Fossil fuel divestment campaigns at US colleges and universities)  Campaigns to divest from fossil fuels are moving at 400 US colleges and universities.  21 November 2013 (Canada's Refusal to Protect Polar Bears Scrutinised)  Canada's Refusal to Protect Polar Bears Scrutinised.  It is a rational policy in a way. If you are determined to run our whole planet off the climate cliff, and destroy most of the existing species before human civilization ceases to be capable of causing more heating, why spend any money on a doomed attempt to protect one of them?  21 November 2013 (Men can reject the social pressure to be "masculine")  Men can reject the social pressure to be "masculine", meaning tough with themselves and cruel to women.  21 November 2013 (Greenpeace and other organizations warn governments to expect rebellion)  Greenpeace and other organizations warn governments to expect rebellion around the world if they do not curb global heating.  They and other organizations held a walkout protest at the climate talks because of the visible lack of ambition to avoid disaster.  It is still possible to avoid 2C of global heating, but it will require denying the plutocrats the increased riches they want.  But we have to start right away &mdash; which Australia, Canada and the US will not allow.  21 November 2013 (GCHQ is in trouble)  GCHQ is in trouble for helping the NSA spy on Britons.  21 November 2013 (Urgent: Free Yorm Bopha)  Everyone: call on Cambodia to free housing activist Yorm Bopha.  21 November 2013 (Urgent: Pledge to boycott GAP, Old Navy and Banana Republic)  Everyone: Pledge to boycott GAP, Old Navy and Banana Republic until they sign the agreement to enforce fair labor standards in Bangladesh.  21 November 2013 (Urgent: Support the Women's Health Protection Act)  US citizens: call your congresscritter to support the Women's Health Protection Act. Also sign this petition.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  21 November 2013 (Urgent: Support Elizabeth Warren's pledge to expand Social Security)  US citizens: support Elizabeth Warren's pledge to expand Social Security.  21 November 2013 (132 poor countries walk out of global heating conference in Warsaw)  132 poor countries have walked out of the global heating conference in Warsaw because the richer countries refused to discuss compensation.  The poor countries want compensation for the tremendous cost of weather disasters caused by rich countries' CO2 emissions, such as 5 billion dollars to rebuild in the Philippines after just one superstorm.  A billion Africans face dangers such as hunger and flooding, and likely resulting war.  With rich countries cutting their CO2 commitments, it looks like the talks are failing entirely and we are on a track towards almost 4C of heating.  It has been clear for several years that the rich countries' governments, in thrall to fossil fuel companies, are determined to continue making this problem worse. Negotiating with them is useless, and serves as cover for making things worse, much like the useless "peace process" between Israel and Palestine.  Overt rupture might be good since it would show the world that we are heading for disaster.  21 November 2013 (Why massive surveillance developed in the US)  Massive surveillance developed in the US because a pliant court operated in secret.  21 November 2013 (Students don't want to pay to study neoclassical economics)  Students don't want to pay to study neoclassical economics, especially now that it has catastrophically failed.  Neoclassical economics is a pseudoscience cult that gives academic respectability to Reagan's bogus trickle-down economics. How did university departments end up hiring mostly cultists? Influence of the rich, that trickle-down was meant to serve, must have played some role. I think it would be interesting to investigate how this occurred.  21 November 2013 (Skype allowed to send data from Europe to the US)  Making a monkey out of European data protection law, Luxembourg ruled that Skype is allowed to send data to the US and the NSA.  21 November 2013 (Anti-Net neutrality proposal in the hands of EU Parliament)  Will the EU Parliament Enable Discrimination Online or Uncompromising Net Neutrality?  21 November 2013 (Obama says one thing, does the opposite)  Obama says he's for legalizing unlocking of cell phones, but he's pushing for the TPP to insist on banning it.  21 November 2013 (Senators join lawsuit against massive surveillance)  Senators joined a lawsuit, claiming there is no evidence that massive metadata surveillance is "useful".  We should not base our argument on the claim that this can never do even the tiniest "good". It's hard to keep batting exactly zero forever even if you're totally inept, so maybe someday this surveillance will turn out to be helpful for something positive. If that happens, that won't be enough to justify it.  21 November 2013 (The forces pushing for bankruptcy in Detroit)  A report accuses the forces pushing for bankruptcy in Detroit have greatly exaggerated the city's debt.  I suspect some persons or businesses hope to make a lot of money from this bankruptcy. Who are they?  21 November 2013 (Putting an end to trafficking and forced labor)  Trafficking and forced labor follow patterns which could be followed to put an end to the practice.  I suspect that the reason the UK does not trace these patterns and put an end to the practice is a lack of will. For instance, the major supermarket chains pressure farm to cut prices, and the supermarkets will be happy if farms do that by means of forced, trafficked workers &mdash; as long as the supermarkets are not punished for it.  If supermarkets were fined 100 times the retain value of any products they sell that are found to have been made with forced labor, they would put an end to the practice for sure.  21 November 2013 (Right-wing think tanks receive $80 million from mysterious sources)  A network of 64 right-wing think tanks received over $80 million in money of mysterious origin.  More information.  21 November 2013 (Foreign exchange trading needs to be taxed for stability)  Most foreign exchange trading is speculation; for stability, we need to tax these trades.  20 November 2013 (90 companies are responsible for most of global heating)  90 companies are responsible for most of global heating.  20 November 2013 (Costs that fossil fuel and global heating will impose)  Many businesses are recognizing the costs that fossil fuel and global heating will impose on them.  Investors are also pressuring fossil fuel companies to report on how their profits would be affected if we cut emissions drastically by 2050. I think the fossil fuel companies have already investigated this and that their behavior &mdash; making governments cancel or sabotage policies meant to reduce emissions &mdash; is their response.  20 November 2013 (International Violence Against Women Act)  The US should pass the International Violence Against Women Act.  20 November 2013 (Poor people in UK suffering from increasing indebtedness)  Poor people in the UK are suffering from increasing indebtedness, which is also true in the US.  20 November 2013 (The next excuse for snooping on everything)  The next excuse for snooping on everything on the Internet will be "child" pornography.  The term "child abuse images" is deceptive: I think in practice it includes teenagers labeled as "children", and stretches the word "abuse" too. However, some of these images will show real abuse of real children.  The government should focus on protecting the children themselves, not on censoring (and surveilling) all communication.  20 November 2013 (Urgent: Remove Koch brother from WGBH board)  In the US: call on WGBH to remove the Koch brother from its board.  20 November 2013 (Urgent: End austerity and close tax loopholes in the US)  US citizens: phone Congress on Dec 12 to end austerity and close tax loopholes.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  20 November 2013 (Urgent: Call on JP Morgan to pay its penalty)  US citizens: call on JP Morgan to pay its penalty and not shift it onto taxpayers.  20 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose "fast-track authority" for the TPP)  US citizens: sign this petition against "fast-track authority" for the TPP.  I've recommended several actions against the TPP; please do them all. This is so bad that it's worth a few minutes of your time.  20 November 2013 (Urgent: Remove lead from aviation fuel)  US citizens: call on the EPA to remove lead from aviation fuel.  20 November 2013 (Efforts to protect journalism in Iceland rendered ineffective)  Iceland's initiative to protect journalism may be rendered ineffective by massive surveillance that scares off sources.  20 November 2013 (NSA provided information to other agencies)  The NSA defied the FISA court by providing information to other agencies.  20 November 2013 (Kenyan anti-terror thugs)  The Kenyan anti-terror thugs are accused of killing and disappearing people.  20 November 2013 (Estimated cost of rebuilding the Philippines)  New estimate for rebuilding the Philippines: 5 billion dollars.  20 November 2013 (Socialism in the US)  In the US, "Socialism" is no longer tarred with the association of Communism.  Nowadays, it's the US government that's spying on everyone, even worse than the Soviet government did.  19 November 2013 (Rich fossil-burning countries ought to pay for costs of weather disasters)  Rich fossil-burning countries ought to pay for the costs of the weather disasters they impose on poor countries.  19 November 2013 (Summary of why TPP is harmful)  A clear summary of why the TPP is harmful and unjust.  Most Americans will lose economically, as well as losing freedom, since these exploitation treaties transfer wealth from workers to business owners.  19 November 2013 (The two central ideals of Gettysburg Address under threat)  The two central ideals of the Gettysburg Address are under threat today.  19 November 2013 (Some LG "smart" TVs send surveillance data to the manufacturer)  Some LG "smart" TVs send surveillance data to the manufacturer.  A friend commented:  Note the article makes a mistake: that the destination page returns a 404 error means nothing. First of all, it's extremely easy to fake an error code (I know that in PHP it's just one line of code!). Second, even if it's indeed missing, all the data is still going to the server logs anyway, and it wouldn't be hard to retrieve it from there (in fact, using this would make the load on the server much smaller as no script ever gets executed).   19 November 2013 (Labeling tar sands oil as highly polluting would "stigmatize" Canada)  Canada's "natural resources" minister charged that labeling tar sands oil as highly polluting would "stigmatize" Canada.  Ready, aim, stigmatize!  Something that stigmatizes Canada even worse is its policy of encouraging other countries to help fry our planet.  19 November 2013 (Oil spill inevitable if Russia drills in Arctic waters)  Oil spill expert Simon Boxall says a devastating oil spill is inevitable if Russia drills in Arctic waters.  19 November 2013 (Urgent: End filibusters on judicial nominees)  US citizens: call on your senators to end filibusters on judicial nominees.  19 November 2013 (Urgent: Defend Obama's health care reform)  US citizens: Call on Congress to defend Obama's health care reform.  What we really need is a national health service, but the right-wing demand to undo what Obama did would make things worse.  19 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose bills that pander to fossil fuels)  US citizens: phone your Congresscritter to oppose bills that pander to fossil fuels. Also send email through this page.   The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  19 November 2013 (Urgent: Releasing prisoners from Guantanamo or trying them in civil court)  US citizens: call on your senators to support Senator Levin's bill to facilitate releasing prisoners from Guantanamo or trying them in civil court.  19 November 2013 (Walmart is soliciting food donations for its employees)  A Walmart is soliciting food donations for its employees, because they can't afford a Thanksgiving meal on low Walmart wages.  19 November 2013 (Haitians protested demanding the resignation of the president)  Thousands of Haitians protested demanding the resignation of the president, who was more or less imposed by the US.  19 November 2013 (EPA reducing amount of corn-based ethanol to use in US cars)  The EPA is reducing the amount of corn-based ethanol to use in US cars, but it should reduce this to zero.  19 November 2013 (The Gates Foundation talks about giving everyone in the world a toilet)  The Gates Foundation talks about giving everyone in the world a toilet to use, but its solutions are ridiculously expensive.  19 November 2013 (Sentenced to prison for tweeting about trial of dissidents)  Waleed Al-Shehhi was sentenced to prison in the UAE for tweeting about the trial of Islamist dissidents.  19 November 2013 (Proposing state laws to turn off cooperation with NSA massive surveillance)  Proposing state laws to turn off cooperation with NSA massive surveillance.  If this effort is serious, it should start by deactivating the "fusion centers" by which state and local thug departments share information with the FBI about "terrorist suspects" such as Occupy protests.  19 November 2013 (Drones, tanks, and grenade launchers)  Drones, tanks, and grenade launchers: Coming soon to a [thug] department near you.  19 November 2013 (Thugs outraged that city plans to put GPS in their cars)  Boston thugs are outraged that the city plans to put GPS trackers in their official cars.  These cars belong to the city, and their used for official work, so personal privacy is not involved here. Anyway, thugs while on duty are not entitled to the same privacy rights as an ordinary citizen.  19 November 2013 (Supreme Court rejected challenge to legality of massive NSA surveillance)  The Supreme Court rejected EPIC's challenge to the legality of massive NSA surveillance of American's phone calls.  19 November 2013 (Abusing copyright powers must be punished)  Abusing copyright powers must be punished at least as hard as infringing copyright.  19 November 2013 (US blogger imprisoned for disobeying prior censorship order)  A US blogger has been imprisoned for disobeying an unconstitutional prior censorship order.  19 November 2013 (Interview with organizers of anti-Assad militia in Syria)  Interview with the organizers of an anti-Assad militia in Syria.  19 November 2013 (Change in the sea)  How humans are changing the sea &mdash; disastrously.  19 November 2013 (Pope Francis)  When Pope Francis looks good, it is in contrast to the Church's record of bad, bad, bad.  19 November 2013 (UK universities working with thugs to repress student protest)  UK universities are working with thugs to repress student protest at the root.  I think Michael Chessum made a mistake accepting release on the condition that he not engage in protest in or near his university (let alone others). That neutralizes him semipermanently.  I would urge him to tell the court that he rejects the conditions and will go to jail and be a political prisoner rather than legitimize this repression.  19 November 2013 (UN climate chief says most coal reserves must be left in ground)  The UN climate chief told the World Coal Association that most coal reserves must be left in the ground.  Bravo! But unless our governments stand behind this, coal will kill us.  19 November 2013 (The NSA's Global Threat to Free Speech)  The NSA's Global Threat to Free Speech.  19 November 2013 (International agencies demand more austerity in Greece)  International agencies are demanding even more austerity in Greece, despite the objection that this might cause a revolution.  19 November 2013 (US gov't owes Shaker Aamer apology and compensation)  Shaker Aamer was interviewed on 60 Minutes, and demanded to be freed.  Aamer and the others like him conclusively refute the claim that "If you're not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to fear from the US government." The US government owes them an apology and compensation, but most of all it must make sure not to repeat the offense with anyone else.  David Hicks deserves an apology for the torture and unfair trial that the US gave him.  19 November 2013 (Urgent: Pressure Russia to free the Greenpeace 30)  Everyone: Call on Shell to pressure Russia (actually Gazprom) to free the Greenpeace 30.  19 November 2013 ("Healthy aging" is an oxymoron)  "Healthy aging" is an oxymoron. Aging is nothing other than the tendency for bodies to become less healthy.  19 November 2013 (Economic growth without growth in CO2 emissions)  Economic growth does not require growth in CO2 emissions. US per-capita economic production has doubled since 1970 but per-capita CO2 emissions have gone down (though not enough).  The politicians who say this is impossible may be under the influence of the fossil fuel companies.  19 November 2013 (David Hicks deserves an apology)  David Hicks deserves an apology for the torture and unfair trial that the US gave him.  19 November 2013 (Dead hand of dictator Pinochet blocks legal reforms in Chile)  The dead hand of dictator Pinochet, in the form of screwy election rules, continues to block important legal reforms in Chile.  Since Pinochet's rule was not legitimate in the first place, one could argue for following the previous constitution.  19 November 2013 (Companies selling sophisticated surveillance equipment)  Companies are selling sophisticated surveillance equipment, even able to tap fibre cables.  19 November 2013 (One thug's unreconciled testimony against a man shot dead)  No one can reconcile one thug's testimony, that Mark Duggan had a gun in his hand when he was shot dead, with other thugs' report that they found that gun 20 feet away, wrapped in a sock, on the other side of a wall.  It seems that Duggan could not while dying have thrown the gun over the wall, but above all, he could not have put a sock over it at that time.  I suggest that Duggan had no gun, that the one thug is mistaken in saying he saw one, and that another thug placed the gun to be found.  19 November 2013 (Funds to help poor countries survive global heating almost exhausted)  The funds provided to help poor countries survive global heating are almost exhausted and little more is being given.  19 November 2013 (Mainstream media's "experts" in the field of climate science)  Mainstream media can't find real climate scientists to deny global heating, so they present "experts" with no scientific experience in that field.  19 November 2013 (Death toll from Typhoon Haiyan)  The death toll from Typhoon Haiyan is at least 3,900, and the repair will cost half a billion dollars (or more).  18 November 2013 (Urgent: Stand behind Yeb Sa&ntilde;o)  US citizens: stand behind Yeb Sa&ntilde;o, Philippines negotiator at the climate summit.  18 November 2013 (Urgent: Allow states to require labels on GMOs)  US citizens: call on Senator Warren to withdraw support from the FDA's plan that would ban states from requiring labels on GMOs.  18 November 2013 (Large number of Taliban reportedly killed by Afghan army)  The Afghan army has reportedly killed a lot of Taliban, but (as usual) that has little effect on how the war is going.  18 November 2013 (UK tracks diplomats through 350 hotels)  The UK tracks diplomats through 350 important hotels around the world, so as to spy on them.  18 November 2013 (Abuse of migrant workers in Qatar)  A Nepali worker in Qatar describes the abusive treatment by employers.  Amnesty International says these abuses amount to forced labor.  18 November 2013 (The trees uprooted by Typhoon Haiyan)  The trees uprooted by Typhoon Haiyan may never be replaced if more big storms keep coming through. If so, they will give global heating a permanent boost.  18 November 2013 (UK gov't wants power to cancel citizenship)  The UK government wants the power to cancel citizenship, leaving people stateless and exiled.  18 November 2013 (Gov't of Ireland proposes high fees for freedom of information requests)  The government of Ireland proposes to make freedom of information requests so expensive that hardly anyone would dare make them.  18 November 2013 (Regulate automobile insurance the way California does)  All states should regulate automobile insurance the way California does.  In addition, they should ban insurance companies from collecting from drivers any information about the car's location over time, or that would enable deducing the car's location.  18 November 2013 (Christians teach lies about sex in US public schools)  Christians teach lies about sex in US public schools.  18 November 2013 (Geithner will receive his reward)  Geithner will now receive his reward for years of loyal service to Wall Street as Secretary of the Treasury.  18 November 2013 (How Our Public Schools Became a "Communist Threat")  How Our Public Schools Became a "Communist Threat".  Why Taxpayers Shouldn't Fund Private Schools.  Note how these two forms of plutocratic pressure line up ironically.  18 November 2013 (Anti-Drone Movement Speaks)  Anti-Drone Movement Speaks: 'End the Secrecy, No to Kill List'.  18 November 2013 (Thugs spying on protesters offer excuse that they are "anarchists")  In North Carolina, the thugs spying on protesters offer the excuse that they are "anarchists".  Remember when it was "terrorists"?  18 November 2013 (Obama jails another whistleblower)  Obama has jailed another whistleblower.  This one was found by massively searching journalists' phone records.  18 November 2013 (Jeremy Hammond and the Need to "Promote Respect for the Rule of Law")  Jeremy Hammond and the Need to "Promote Respect for the Rule of Law".  I wish they did not equate "hacking" with "breaking security".  On Hacking  18 November 2013 (Long prison sentences for throwing pies at an official)  Spanish protesters are threatened with long prison sentences for throwing pies at an official.  This reflects the general attitude of the right-wing party that rules Spain, which seeks to abolish democratic rights in practice even though not in theory.  18 November 2013 (Body scanner in new Xbox)  The new Xbox has a body scanner that can make a very sharp image of your body under your clothing.  When you enter someone's home, ask if there is an Xbox present and, if so, insist on seeing it unplugged.  18 November 2013 (Nader calls on Washington Post to maintain editorial independence from owner)  Ralph Nader calls on the Washington Post to set up a structure to maintain editorial independence from its owner, also the owner of Amazon.  Amazon mistreats nearly everyone involved with books, including its customers.  18 November 2013 (Company makes customers promise never to publicly criticize it)  A nefarious company, Kleargear, makes customers promise never to publicly criticize the company, and "fines" them if they do. The "fine" is probably not legally enforceable, but poor people lack the resources to fight back.  One solution: someone else who has never done business with Kleargear can post the condemnation.  If the TPP passes, foreign companies would be able to sue the US government if it enforces the first amendment against such behavior.  18 November 2013 (Regulations don't destroy jobs)  Businesses have a history of forecasting that regulations will destroy lots of jobs&hellip;but, in the end, that never seems to happen.  What does destroy jobs? Austerity. Prioritizing efficiency over jobs.  18 November 2013 (Election in the Maldives)  The Maldives held a democratic election. The right-wing islamist won.  We will see how human right are treated subsequently.  18 November 2013 (Greek group claims responsibility for killing Golden Dawn supporters)  A Greek group, never before heard of, claimed responsibility for killing Golden Dawn supporters as retaliation for a Golden Dawn's supporter's murder of a left-wing rapper.  18 November 2013 (Priority of the Australian gov't and fossil fuel industry)  The highest priority policy goal of the Australian government is the fossil fuel industry's priority, which is to ensure humanity uses the maximum amount of fossil fuel in the shortest possible time.  18 November 2013 (Prisoners with cancer in Arizona denied medical care)  Prisoners with cancer in Arizona are denied medical care and told to pray instead.  That's religion for you.  18 November 2013 (Will the FBI be investigated?)  Jeremy Hammond says that the FBI directed him (via its tool, Sabu) to crack web sites in Brazil, Iran and Turkey, and the FBI then took advantage of this.  Will the FBI be investigated?  18 November 2013 (Urgent: Expand Social Security)  US citizens: tell Congress to expand Social Security.  18 November 2013 (Urgent: Expand Medicare to all Americans)  US citizens: Tell Congress to respect the progress in the Affordable Care Act, and vote on expanding Medicare to all Americans.  18 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose Feinstein's fake fix for gov't surveillance)  US citizens: phone your senators to oppose Feinstein's fake fix for government surveillance.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  18 November 2013 (Woman in Texas "colonias" cant get health care)  The women in Texas "colonias" near the Mexican border can't travel far enough to get an abortion, or a cancer test, or any other health care. Even when they can afford the treatment, they are afraid of being deported while traveling for care, even if they are legal US residents.  18 November 2013 (TPP a way for the US to reassert its role as world bully)  Richard Falkvinge says the TPP is the United States' way to reassert its role as a world bully.  18 November 2013 (Republicans blame Obama for insurance companies' actions)  Republicans are blaming Obama for the medical plans that insurance companies choose to cancel, and the ones they created just recently knowing they couldn't continue.  Setting aside those, which are the insurance companies' fault, Obama's health care claim (that people can keep their old insurance plans) is true.  18 November 2013 (China's detention system)  China: Abolition of Labour Camps Must Lead to Wider Detention Reform.  18 November 2013 (MPAA's theater security)  Alongside the TSA security theater, we suffer from the MPAA's theater security.  18 November 2013 (The USA FREEDOM Act does not go far enough)  The EFF supports the USA FREEDOM Act as a first step, saying it does not go far enough.  The EFF says that additional measures are needed to limit the government's access to data in private hands, and I agree about those points. However, that too fails to go far enough, because it does not limit the government's own direct collection of data about people (for instance, with license plate recognizers, surveillance cameras, and microphones in places such as buses and lampposts) or business collection of data about people. Once data is collected, it will be misused. We therefore must strictly limit the systematic collection of data about people.  18 November 2013 (UK's Iraq war inquiry)  Both the US and the UK governments are trying to spike the UK's Iraq war inquiry.  17 November 2013 (Urgent: Call on the Supreme Court to apply ethical standards to itself)  US citizens: call on the Supreme Court to apply to itself the ethical standards for all other federal judges.  17 November 2013 (Urgent: Petition against the Trans Pacific Partnership)  Everyone: sign this petition against the Trans Pacific Partnership.  17 November 2013 (Urgent: Block the attempt to ban abortions after 20 weeks)  US citizens: call on the Senate to block the attempt to ban abortions after 20 weeks.  Such late abortions are only done when something goes gravely wrong.  17 November 2013 (Urgent: Support Philippines Climate Commissioner Yeb Sa&ntilde;o)  Everyone: stand in support of Philippines Climate Commissioner Yeb Sa&ntilde;o, demanding strong action to curb global heating.  17 November 2013 (Cameron calls for inquiry into Sri Lanka's human rights abuses)  Cameron, embarrassed about having attended the Commonwealth summit in Sri Lanka, now calls for an international inquiry into Sri Lanka's human rights abuses.  17 November 2013 (UK lawyers plan to go on strike)  UK lawyers plan to go on strike against plans to cut payments to defense lawyers.  17 November 2013 (Anonymous activists accessing US gov't computers)  Anonymous activists have been accessing US government computers, putting the shoe on the other foot. Strangely, the US government doesn't like being treated the way it treats us.  It would in general be wrong to take money from individuals' bank accounts; I hope these crackers are honest enough not to do that.  17 November 2013 (UK journalist in Sri Lanka blocked from observing Tamil areas)  A UK journalist in Sri Lanka reports that the government sent crowds to block him from travelling to the north to observe the conditions in the Tamil areas.  17 November 2013 (The Assassination of Yasser Arafat)  Uri Avnery says it must be Ariel Sharon who ordered the assassination of Yasser Arafat.  17 November 2013 (Jeremy Hammond receives 10-year prison sentence)  Jeremy Hammond received a 10-year prison sentence, which he calls a political act.  He said that the suggestions for which sites to target came from the FBI tool, Sabu.  I do wish he would not use the word "hacking" to refer to security breaking. That confuses the public about the activities of hackers like me, which don't involve security breaking.  17 November 2013 (Unarmed protesters shot and killed by Libyan militia)  A Libyan militia shot and killed unarmed protesters calling on the militia to disband.  17 November 2013 (Eternal Austerity Makes Complete Sense &mdash; If You're Rich)  Eternal Austerity Makes Complete Sense &mdash; If You're Rich.  17 November 2013 (CIA collecting financial records of nearly all Americans)  The CIA is collecting the financial records of nearly all Americans.  17 November 2013 (Right-wing extremist parties gaining strength in parts of Europe)  Right-wing extremist parties are gaining strength in many parts of Europe.  These parties are willing to fight hard against the immigrants that they blame for the spread of poverty, while parties on the left are generally timid about confronting the plutocrats that are really to blame. People who are willing to fight, and don't have a firm grip on who the enemy is, may choose the right wing parties just to see a real fight against someone.  17 November 2013 (Commonwealth Foundation's charity events in Sri Lanka)  Sri Lanka's government tried to take control of the Commonwealth Foundation's charity events.  17 November 2013 (UK rapporteur accuses UK political leaders of verging on tyranny)  The UN rapporteur on freedom of expression accused UK political leaders of verging on tyranny by calling the Guardian's journalism a crime.  16 November 2013 (Urgent: Call for reform of the ECPA)  US citizens: call for reform of the ECPA.  15 November 2013 (Urgent: Petition against TPP)  US citizens: Sign this petition against the TPP.  15 November 2013 (Urgent: Tell Nestle to stop drying up part of Pakistan)  Everyone: tell Nestle to stop drying up part of Pakistan for bottled water.  15 November 2013 (Urgent: Tell ex-senator to stop representing Monsanto)  US citizens: tell ex-senator Blanche Lincoln to stop representing Monsanto.  15 November 2013 (Japan abandons plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions)  Japan has effectively abandoned its plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  15 November 2013 (People who look for food to survive after a disaster)  The presumption that people looking for food to survive after a disaster are "looters" regularly provides an excuse to repress them.  15 November 2013 (Thugs seek informers in dissident groups on UK college campuses)  The search for informers in dissident groups on UK college campuses is part of a broader pattern of repression.  15 November 2013 (US judge rebukes gov't for not prosecuting banksters)  A US judge rebuked the US government for not prosecuting any banksters for their frauds.  15 November 2013 (Acceleration of deforestation in Brazil)  Deforestation in Brazil sped up greatly in the past year, partly due to a change in forestry law that people campaigned to stop.  15 November 2013 (Op-eds for austerity written by right-wing students)  The plutocrats of Fix the Debt wrote op-eds for austerity and got right-wing students to submit the text as their own writing.  15 November 2013 (Clearcutting threatens rare possum in Australia)  A rare possum in Australia is threatened by clearcutting.  14 November 2013 (Chapter from TPP leaked)  A chapter of the TPP has been leaked, covering a wide range of topic including copyrights, patents, ISP censorship, and international tribunals that don't care about human rights.  Not surprisingly, the US government takes the harshest position towards people (including Americans). However, there is no possible good to be achieved by such a treaty; all it can do is harm.  This would attack our freedom in many unrelated ways, but the most basic attack, which paves the way for the others, lies in lumping together so many unrelated laws and issues and calling them "intellectual property" as if they had some coherent relationship. That term spreads confusion, and if we repeat it when criticizing the details of the chapter, we're undermining our own side.  The TPP's an attack on public health.  13 US cities held protests against the TPP.  14 November 2013 (FBI wants to shut down FOIA requests)  A technique helps people get more information from FOIA requests to the FBI, so the FBI wants to shut down all FOIA requests for 7 years.  The FBI says that these requests threaten national security. I think the FBI threatens national security and doesn't want us to find out about it.  14 November 2013 (Campaign for more gun control blocked)  The campaign for more gun control in the US has been blocked.  There are good reasons to condemn the US government &mdash; for catering to the rich and failing to help the poor, for instance &mdash; and right-wingers are surprisingly good at twisting this anger to their own uses. Owning a gun won't protect you when you can't afford medical care, when you can't get a job, when a bank commits fraud to take your house, when the government forces you to have a baby, or when the government signs a free exploitation treaty that gives foreign corporations privileges over you. The way to protect yourself from that is to vote for progressives.  14 November 2013 (UK Conservative Party deletes old speeches from web site)  The UK Conservative Party deleted lots of old speeches from its web site, and set up a robots.txt file to tell the Internet Archive to stop distributing its copies.  A friend at the archive told me they removed the robots.txt file subsequently, apparently in response to public criticism.  UK conservatives advocate permanent austerity, permanent suffering for most of the country.  14 November 2013 (UK opposes investigation into flaws put into our computer systems)  The UK opposes a European investigation into the flaws deliberately put into our computer systems.  14 November 2013 (Sabotaging negotiations aimed at preventing global heating)  Australia seems to be planning to sabotage negotiations aimed at preventing global heating.  Alas, so is the US (in a subtler way).  14 November 2013 (A god's sadism)  Devout Muslims want their brain-damaged father, who has more or less ceased to be conscious, kept alive with heroic measures so he can suffer.  They say that suffering brings him "closer to god". I guess that god is a sadist &mdash; which would fit the amount of suffering in the world.  14 November 2013 (Corporate America's New Scam)  Corporate America's New Scam: Industry P.R. Firm Poses as Think Tank!  14 November 2013 (US is bullying UK to conceal Dubya's discussions with B'liar)  The US is bullying the UK to conceal Dubya's discussions with B'liar, which would indicate how much B'liar shared responsibility for the invasion and occupation of Iraq.  14 November 2013 (Watch the World's Forests Disappear on Google Earth)  Watch the World's Forests Disappear on Google Earth.  If you are thinking of trying to use Google Earth yourself, be sure to disable Javascript first, or install LibreJS. If a site doesn't work with LibreJS enabled, you should not use it.  14 November 2013 (Urgent: Support the Drone Strike Transparency bill)  US citizens: support the Drone Strike Transparency bill.  14 November 2013 (EFF and other opponents of TPP challenge NSA)  The EFF and other opponents of the TPP challenged the NSA to affirm it is not spying on their work.  14 November 2013 (How the NSA has converted the Internet)  How the NSA has converted the Internet into a device for injecting malware.  14 November 2013 (New street lights have audio recording, video cameras, and cell phone tracking)  New street lights have audio recording, video cameras, and cell phone tracking. Because they connect to the Internet, they are unacceptable surveillance.  Worse, the proliferation of sensors threatens a regime of 100% enforcement of lots of petty rules, that would leave people feeling they are ruled by robots.  14 November 2013 (Trademark Law)  Trademark Law Does Not Require Companies To Tirelessly Censor the Internet.  14 November 2013 (Chris Christie condemns methods, then uses the same ones)  US citizens: Chris Christie condemned the previous governor's methods for balancing the budget, then used the same ones.  He has not done a good job economically in New Jersey.  One point in that article is questionable. Is it good for a state to have a "business-friendly" tax policy? Often it is bad.  14 November 2013 (Urgent: Block fracking on public lands)  US citizens: call on Obama to block fracking on public lands.  14 November 2013 (Court rules Google Books is fair use)  A court ruled that Google Books is fair use.  Google tried first to get special permission by making a settlement with a few large publishers. Many authors, including me, objected to this deal, and the court rejected the settlement. Thus, Google was forced to argue that this is fair use, which means we are all free to do this.  14 November 2013 (UK thug filmed trying to recruit activist)  A UK thug was filmed trying to recruit an activist in at Cambridge to report on students for dissident behavior.  This shows the real reason they want to spy on everyone. The "terrorists" they want to catch are the dissidents, often labeled as "terrorists" by the enemies of democracy.  14 November 2013 (US gov't keeps track of who purchases books about lying and polygraphs)  The US government keeps track of who purchases books about lying and polygraphs.  14 November 2013 (US wants the TPP to require ISPs to monitor and punish customers)  The US wants the TPP to require ISPs to monitor and punish their customers, and narrow down fair use.  Even one of these would be a disaster, so we must defeat the TPP.  More nasty stuff: requiring patents on medical treatments, raising prices of medicines (this will kill people!),   Watch out! That article is steeped in enemy propaganda terms such as "intellectual property" and "protection". Using these terms helps the enemy.  The article also assumes that the unjust requirements of the WTO will be maintained. Thus, it disregards one big injustice in the TPP: making future copyright reform impossible.  14 November 2013 (Urgent: Defend regulation of fracking on gov't land)  US citizens: tell your congresscritter to oppose the bill to end regulation of fracking on government land.  14 November 2013 (UK gov't condemns escape of prisoner after helping to torture him)  The UK government condemns Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed's escape, but the UK kidnaped him after helping to torture him, and then denied him justice. Why shouldn't he escape?  He might have despicable Islamist views that don't respect other people's human rights. But that is no excuse for torturing him, kidnaping him, or suppressing his lawsuit for torture.  When a government is accused of crimes, and the same government obstructs justice, that is grounds to declare it guilty as charged.  14 November 2013 (Canada against reduction of greenhouse gas emissions)  Canada encourages other countries not to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  This shows that Canada's government has the explicit goal of frying our planet. Canada already has a clear policy of trying to increase its own fossil fuel exports, but this goes even further.  Countries greatly threatened by global heating, such as Bangladesh and Spain, should regard Canada's conduct as an act of war. It can kill millions of people.  14 November 2013 (Crime gangs worried about interference from Pope)  Crime gangs are worried that Pope Francis will interfere with their corruption of the Vatican Bank.  14 November 2013 (Life without parole in the US for nonviolent offenses)  More Than 3,200 Serving Life Without Parole [in the US] for Nonviolent Offenses, Finds ACLU.  14 November 2013 (Qatar blocks football player from leaving country)  A football player who sued his team in Qatar for not paying his salary has been blocked from leaving Qatar by denying him an exit visa.  It is a fundamental injustice to require people to get an exit visa to leave a country. The Soviet Union did this. But what else would you expect from a country that works foreigners to death?  I think you'd have to be a fool to go to Qatar.  14 November 2013 (New method of freeing Americans from debt)  Occupy has found a new method of freeing Americans from debt.  Since bankruptcy is available to clear most kinds of debt, but not student loans, I wonder if it might be a good idea to apply this specifically at student loans.  14 November 2013 (Guant&aacute;namo 12 Years On)  Guant&aacute;namo 12 Years On: How the Media [Are] Missing the Point.  14 November 2013 (Protections for cod in the North Sea)  Protections for cod in the North Sea are starting to raise the population, so we need to keep them in place until the numbers get high enough.  Protecting fish stocks generally entails overcoming the short-termism of the fishermen.  14 November 2013 (Violence between Israelis and Palestinians)  Violence between Israelis and Palestinians is increasing.  As usual, most of the victims are Palestinians. The article doesn't say, but I suspect that the Palestinian perpetrators are punished but the Israelis are not.  14 November 2013 (Palestinians attacking Israeli soldiers with knives)  Palestinians are attacking Israeli soldiers with knives, apparently retaliating for increased violence by Israelis against civilians.  14 November 2013 (Morsi refuses to cooperate with trial proceedings)  Morsi called the head of the military government a "traitor" and refuses to cooperate with the trial proceedings.  Relatives of the people whose murder Morsi's accused of inciting placed the charges before the coup. I won't say that Morsi can't be guilty of this; I don't know the facts. If he is guilty, that justifies some sort of prosecution, but doesn't justify a military coup.  14 November 2013 (23 petty crimes that have landed people in prison for life)  23 Petty Crimes That Have Landed People in Prison for Life Without Parole.  14 November 2013 (Campaign to ban autonomous killer robots)  Support the campaign to ban autonomous killer robots.  13 November 2013 (Costa Rica's public banks)  Costa Rica's public banks have shielded that country from the worst damage, even through US economic warfare that subjugated the economy in every other aspect.  By the way, the world urgently needs some countries to default on their debt, so as to teach predatory lenders a lesson. At present they have every reason to suppose they can profit heavily by leading a country into international debt.  13 November 2013 (De facto segregation has returned to US schools)  De facto segregation has returned to US schools. Where in the 1950s it was segregation between schools in the same school district, now it is segregation between school districts.  This seems to be a consequence of de facto segregation in housing.  When combined with the practice of funding education mostly from local property taxes, the result is that the schools where poor children go are badly funded.  Real-Life Hunger Is No Game.  13 November 2013 (ALEC's latest nasty proposal)  ALEC's latest nasty proposal: an agency to streamline privatization of any government services, including any and all roads.  This would naturally lead to a new form of massive surveillance of drivers.  13 November 2013 (Child care costs more than college)  In most US states, child care costs more than college.  This may have contributed to the big increase in discouraged workers, as parents find that the costs of going to work leave them with no gain from working.  If it were feasible for these people to work, that would not create jobs for them. Rather, they would appear in the unemployment rate, and thus make the harm done by anti-employment anti-poor policies harder to disguise.  Growing up in poverty can permanently stunt a person, so the US policies that augment child poverty are causing irreparable damage.  13 November 2013 (US school "reform")  US school "reform" turns weak evidence into "proof" that their methods work.  13 November 2013 (Palestinian journalist was secretly arrested)  Palestinian journalist Mohammed Abu Khdeir was secretly arrested when returning from Egypt. In Israel it is forbidden to report the arrest.  13 November 2013 (Israel plans to demolish 2000 housing units)  To force 15,000 Palestinians out of the territory Israel has annexed to Jerusalem, Israel plans to demolish 2000 housing units. Some of them are slated to become parks.  13 November 2013 (Israeli army ordered Palestinians to uproot their olive trees)  The Israeli army ordered Palestinians to uproot their olive trees because an Israeli colony is being built nearby on their land.  The government says the colony is illegal, but it nonetheless receives government support. The state is trying to have it both ways.  The attacks against Palestinian agriculture proceed constantly, with the tacit support of the Israeli army and state. They get so little attention that Palestinians despair of reporting them.  13 November 2013 (Armed Israeli colonists attacked Palestinian farms)  Armed Israeli colonists attacked a Palestinian villages farms, and Nadel Shafiq Taher Shatiya photographed them. When soldiers came, they took his cameras and gave them to the colonists, who later returned them broken.  The army generally does not dare confront the violent colonists.  13 November 2013 (Israeli troops shot and killed Ahmad Tazaz'ah)  An unofficial investigation found that Israeli troops shot and killed Ahmad Tazaz'ah while he was doing nothing in particular, in violation of their rules of engagement.  13 November 2013 (People afraid to phone for help, fearing NSA surveillance)  22 organizations report that people are now afraid to phone them for help, fearing NSA surveillance.  These organizations are now suing the government.  13 November 2013 (The New York Times endorsed Trans Pacific Partnership)  The New York Times endorsed the Trans Pacific Partnership sight unseen. How's that for bowing to the plutocrats?  13 November 2013 (Inside Chinese Labor Camp)  Inside The Chinese Labor Camp That Made Halloween Decorations Sold At Kmart.  KMart says it has different suppliers now, so if any of the present suppliers are using political prisoners as workers, KMart can remain ignorant. That's how flexibility of the supply chain makes room for sweatshops, factory fires and slave labor.  It should be KMart's legal responsibility to know these things, to ensure that it isn't using prison labor.  13 November 2013 (Employees of G4S accused of forging papers)  Employees of G4S, one of the main privatizers of government services in the UK, have been accused of forging papers to thwart someone's case for asylum.  In South Africa, G4S operates a prison and has been accused of giving prisoners electric shocks and forced injections.  13 November 2013 (Reporter Francesca Borri)  Reporter Francesca Borri: In Aleppo I only survive by looking Syrian.  13 November 2013 (Iraqi women had more rights under Saddam)  Iraqi women had far more rights under Saddam Hussein than they do now.  13 November 2013 (Afghanistan is growing a record opium crop)  Afghanistan is growing a record opium crop.  13 November 2013 (Urgent: Call on US border patrol to limit use of deadly force)  US citizens: call on the US border patrol to limit its use of deadly force &mdash; use it only when necessary.  This doesn't mean they can't defend themselves. It means they shouldn't shoot someone in the head &mdash; and 8 more times, once he is flat on the ground &mdash; for throwing rocks.  13 November 2013 (Urgent: Call on Obama to meet with striking Walmart workers)  Everyone: call on Obama to meet with Walmart workers that are on strike.  13 November 2013 (Urgent: Protest in Paris against TAFTA, Nov 24)  In Paris: protest Nov 24 against the proposed free exploitation treaty, TAFTA.  13 November 2013 (UK gov't wants more surveillance power)  The UK government wants even more surveillance power, showing contempt for freedom.  13 November 2013 (Democrats condemn Clinton as a servant of Wall Street)  Many Democrats, revitalized in demanding progressive policies, condemn Clinton as a servant of Wall Street.  13 November 2013 (Elizabeth Warren rebukes federal regulators and Congress)  Elizabeth Warren rebuked federal regulators and Congress for allowing banks to remain "too big to fail".  13 November 2013 (Self-censorship of American writers due to NSA surveillance)  American writers say they self-censor because of NSA surveillance.  13 November 2013 (NY Times duped by NSA excuses)  The New York Times tries unremittingly to believe NSA excuses.  13 November 2013 (UK spies use man-in-the-middle network switch to insert malware)  UK spies used a man-in-the-middle network switch to create fake LinkedIn profile pages as as to insert malware into the computers of employees of Belgacom, a Belgian mobile phone company.  This is how the GCHQ spies described their "vision" in 2011: "Any mobile device, anywhere, anytime!" Mobile phones made today all have a universal back door: if you carry one, you're a sucker.  13 November 2013 (Areas near Fukushima uninhabitable for many years)  Some areas near Fukushima will be considered uninhabitable for many years.  13 November 2013 (Israeli soldiers occupy Palestinian homes)  Israeli soldiers occupy Palestinian homes as "training".  13 November 2013 (Global campaign to give women access to contraceptives)  The global campaign to give women access to contraceptives proceeds despite opposition from prudish religion.  13 November 2013 (Cosmic ray theory bites the dust)  The global heating denialists' cosmic ray theory bites the dust.  I'm sure they will find another straw to grasp at &mdash; there are so many candidates, and the pay is so good.  13 November 2013 (Rising theft of food from stores in the UK)  Theft of food from stores in the UK is rising due to increased poverty. It is noteworthy that a substantial fraction is stolen by staff. Perhaps these stores should pay their staff better.  I don't think there is anything wrong in stealing food if you're in a place where there is sufficient nutritious food but you can't afford it. However, that argument doesn't apply to stealing luxurious food.  13 November 2013 (New Leak Reveals Spy Agencies Tapped Int'l Oil Group)  Oil Espionage: New Leak Reveals Spy Agencies Tapped Int'l Oil Group.  How does this relate to stopping terrorism, which is the supposed excuse for NSA general surveillance? Well, Saudi Arabia is a member of OPEC, and most of the Sep 2001 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia. Is that the excuse?  12 November 2013 (Poor people prevented from getting medical care in the US)  How GOP Governors Are Preventing Millions Of Low-Income Diabetic Americans From Getting Medical Care.  The Republicans in Georgia, by refusing to extend Medicaid to poor people, are also cutting off funding for hospitals that do treat the poor.  12 November 2013 (US stops claiming that massive phone tracking is "indispensable")  As the US argues in court for tracking everyone's phone calls, it seems to have quietly retracted the claim that this is "indispensable" for finding terrorists.  This is significant because that claim was the reason the FISA court approved this tracking.  12 November 2013 (Texans fear old oil pipeline will leak again)  Texans fear an old oil pipeline will leak again and pollute their reservoir.  12 November 2013 (Americans without jobs)  5 million Americans have given up on finding a job since the crisis 6 years ago.  Those who still have jobs are worse off: the median wage has declined 4%.  12 November 2013 (Death of cyclists due to collisions with cars)  US thugs, courts and jurors accept the death of cyclists due to collisions with cars as normal.  Punishing the few drivers that hit a cyclist while following usual driving practices will not change the usual driving practices. It will strike jurors as unfair to punish someone for doing what "everybody does".  To change these practices requires adopting clear rules that will make cyclists safer, then punishing violations of these rules whether or not a cyclist was hit.  12 November 2013 (World's ten worst toxic sites)  The world's ten worst toxic sites.  None of them is in a wealthy country. Wealthy countries have for some decades offloaded their pollution onto poor countries.  12 November 2013 (How the Koch Brothers Organized the Federal Shutdown)  How the Koch Brothers Organized the Federal Shutdown.  12 November 2013 (Heat waves could kill 2000 people a year in Eastern US by 2060)  Heat waves could kill 2000 people a year in the Eastern US by 2060.  If global heating leads to a collapse of today's technological systems and air conditioning ceases to be available, that might go up to 20,000 a year, or more.  12 November 2013 (US funds unneeded weapons but cuts programs to help the poor)  The US plutocracy funds weapons even if they fail in tests, but calls successful programs to help the poor "failures" in order to cut them.  12 November 2013 (Software that tries to diagnose person's state of health from voice)  Software is being developed to try to diagnose a person's state of health from voice.  Will there also be software to change your voice to hide these problems?  12 November 2013 (Denying Palestinian prisoners proper medical treatment)  Palestinians accuse Israel of denying Palestinian prisoners proper medical treatment for diseases such as cancer.  12 November 2013 (Tax subsidies for fossil fuel)  The Democrats' list of tax loopholes to be closed inexplicably omits the tax subsidies for fossil fuel.  12 November 2013 (Climate-Friendly farming)  We must promote climate-friendly farming before it's too late.  12 November 2013 (Al Qa'ida recruiting suicide bombers in Turkey)  Al Qa'ida is recruiting suicide bombers in Turkey, and parents are afraid their sons will be recruited and die.  People say the government turns a blind eye to it.  One of the "new atheists" wrote that moderate religion contributes to the crimes of extreme religion by protecting it from criticism. This seems to be a good example of it. Any form of Islam makes a person vulnerable to infection by the jihadi mind-virus.  12 November 2013 (The pleasure of alcohol without some of the damage)  A designer drug could give the pleasure of alcohol without some of the damage.  This new drug might be less addictive than alcohol, but that's not automatic. Addiction results from the body's physiological adaptation to the effects of the drug. Whichever receptors respond to the new drug as they do to alcohol, they would tend to adapt and produce addiction. Meanwhile, whichever body systems are not affected by the new drug would not develop addiction; that might reduce the total addictive effect, but how much that occurs would have to be seen.  12 November 2013 (Philippine gov't planning how it will cope when global heating gets worse)  The Philippine government is planning how it will cope when global heating gets even worse.  But since that will become impossible in a few decades, it is also pushing for strong action to curb global heating.  12 November 2013 (Negotiations with Iran seem to have failed)  The negotiations with Iran seem to have failed over a rather small disagreement, which gives hope that further discussions could bridge the gap.  12 November 2013 (Can we stop using disposable plastic cutlery)  Can we stop using disposable plastic cutlery by bringing our own?  It will be hard for travelers to do this unless they can bring their cutlery onto an airplane. Given that there is no real danger in this, the TSA ought to permit it.  12 November 2013 (Genetically engineered yeast)  Genetically engineered yeast have been designed to produce medicines, flavorings and other useful things.  Although "in principle" the substances that are made ought to be safe, that can have exceptions &mdash; and each case is a different issue.  12 November 2013 (Sweden is closing prisons)  Sweden is closing prisons because of increased emphasis on rehabilitation and a relaxation in the War on Drugs.  If the US tries to do this, the owners of private prisons will sue.  12 November 2013 (Sri Lanka urged UK not to regulate press)  Newspapers in Sri Lanka urged the UK not to proceed with a royal charter to regulate the press, lest states like Sri Lanka cite it as a precedent.  12 November 2013 (Urgent: Independent courts for accusations of rape in the US military)  US citizens: call on your senators to vote for independent courts for accusations of rape and sexual harassment in the US military.  12 November 2013 (Price controls in Venezuela)  President Maduro has sent state agents to enforce low prices in some stores in Venezuela.  In general, price controls cause shortages and are not a good idea. However, if applied only to certain stores which were given permission to buy dollaws at the low "official" exchange rate, they can be seen as a condition of getting that permission, and they should not cause shortages.  Venezuela has had shortages of certain products. No one I met there could tell me why, but it did not seem to be due to price controls.  12 November 2013 (US to ceremonially destroy stockpile of seized ivory)  The US will ceremonially destroy its stockpile of seized ivory, as part of a campaign to end legal sales of ivory.  12 November 2013 (Sri Lanka arrests Australian senator and New Zealand MP)  An Australian senator and a New Zealand MP went to Sri Lanka on a fact-finding mission to judge whether their countries should attend the Commonwealth Summit. Sri Lanka made the answer quite clear by arresting them.  This ham-fisted attempt at repression would be funny, if it were not for the seriousness of the repression when it is aimed at Sri Lankan dissidents and journalists.  12 November 2013 (Poor South Africans organize for housing rights)  The poorest South Africans organize for housing rights, against the corruption of the state, and despite repression that goes as far as murder.  11 November 2013 (Urgent: Respect for the rights of prisoners who report prison abuses)  US citizens: sign this petition to respect the rights of prisoners who report on prison abuses.  11 November 2013 (Seven Things Veterans Need More Than a Holiday)  Seven Things Veterans Need More Than a Holiday.  The US attracts youths into the army by telling them they will "serve their country". As we know, that's only occasionally what US soldiers are used for. If we spread the word about what they are really likely to do, it might do some good.  11 November 2013 (Bloomberg News censors stories about China)  Bloomberg News censors stories about China.  11 November 2013 (Mixing liquids to make explosive TATP in a plane impossible)  The liquid bomb terrorists were originally accused of planning to mix liquids to make the explosive TATP in a plane, but that would be impossible.  However, later it came out that their plan was somewhat different, and not impossible, merely very difficult.  11 November 2013 (Ban on practice of discarding "by-catch" not enough)  Banning the practice of discarding "by-catch" (fish that the fishermen did not aim to catch) is not enough to enable overfished stocks to recover.  The only way to protect fish stocks is to defeat the political power of the fishermen, who are generally short-termist.  11 November 2013 (Australia's record-setting high temperatures)  Australia keeps setting high temperature records, but the government, totally subservient to coal interests, says it will reduce plans for CO2 emissions cuts.  These long-term targets sound impressive until they are cancelled without having been achieved. The way to get real results is with a carbon tax.  11 November 2013 (UK gov't invites gas company employee to write energy policy)  The business-ridden UK government invited a gas company employee to write its energy policy.  Note how the ministry claims that conflicts of interest are a minor matter compared with the "knowledge" that business employees have. I'm sure they know plenty about what policies will serve their employers, but knowledge can't compensate for bad goals.  11 November 2013 (Typhoon Haiyan kills over 10,000 people)  Typhoon Haiyan killed over 10,000 people, perhaps much more.  Many of the dead were drowned because the storm drove a 6-meter wall of water onto the land.  The rise in sea level, for which global heating is directly responsible, surely increased the height of the storm surge and therefore increased the death toll. Global heating also played a role in making the storm so strong, which also increased it.  One study forecast that global heating would kill a hundred million people by 2030.  11 November 2013 (Right-wing myths taught in UK economics classes)  Economics classes in the UK continue teaching right-wing myths that the 2008 crash demonstrated were false.  Of course, this was not the first sign that they were false.  I think that an investigation of why these falsehoods are taught would come across the influence of plutocrats' money.  11 November 2013 (France blocks first-stage nuclear deal with Iran)  It seems Israel has convinced France to block a first-stage nuclear deal with Iran.  11 November 2013 (Urgent: Tell Warren Buffet to stop threatening rail workers)  Everyone: tell Warren Buffett to stop threatening rail workers that want to unionize.  11 November 2013 (Urgent: Raise minimum wage to $10)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to support raising the minimum wage to $10. Also sign this petition.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  11 November 2013 (Urgent: Allow free election in Honduras)  US citizens: call on your senators to call for the US to allow a free election in Honduras.  11 November 2013 (Reasons to stop the Trans Pacific Partnership)  Friends of the Earth lists many reasons to stop the Trans Pacific Partnership. This is in addition to the probable injustice against people who share.  11 November 2013 (Is Earth Fucked?)  Geophysicist Brad Werner says "Earth is Fucked" if we continue under plutocracy. We can save the biosphere from global heating disaster, but to do so, we must break out of plutocracy's rules.  11 November 2013 (Reinstatement of Texas law to make abortion unfeasible)  A right-wing US appeals court temporarily reinstated the Texas law to make abortion unfeasible. Some women have been unable to get an abortion as a result. The abortion clinics have appealed directly to the Supreme Court to try to reverse this.  11 November 2013 (Ladar Levison threatened with prosecution for closing Lavabit)  Ladar Levison has been threatened with prosecution for closing Lavabit rather than deceiving all its customers.  11 November 2013 (Working Americans going hungry)  Why Does Congress Think It's OK for Working Americans to Go Hungry?  11 November 2013 (Malala Yousafzai's memoir banned)  Organizations of private schools in Pakistan have banned Malala Yousafzai's memoir from school libraries. The book is not in accord with their religious views, and dissent is not supposed to be allowed.  This sort of disrespect for basic human rights is typical of Islamic countries.  11 November 2013 (Judgment against Chile in Inter-American court)  Leopoldo Garc&iacute;a Lucero, tortured by Pinochet's men after the US-supported coup in Chile, received a judgment against Chile in the Inter-American court.  Nothing can heal the wounds he received, but he is glad to have gained a precedent in the fight against torture and tyranny.  11 November 2013 (Right-wing Democrats)  Hillary Clinton's official actions have served the plutocrats, not the people.  I'm fed up with right-wing Democrats like Clinton, Clinton and Obama. It takes lunatic Republicans to make them look good, but that's not good enough to get my vote.  11 November 2013 (Natural capital)  Will valuing "natural capital" lead businesses to preserve it?  If corporations were inclined to manage their resources for long-term capital value, they might do this to natural systems based on their natural capital. However, corporations today typically don't look beyond the stock price 6 months from now. they are more likely to loot natural systems than manage them.  11 November 2013 (BIOS-level virus that spreads via firmware of USB sticks)  A BIOS-level virus that spreads by infecting the firmware of USB sticks.  11 November 2013 (Coca Cola says it will stop buying sugar from grabbed land)  Coca Cola Company said it would stop buying sugar grown on land that has been taken away from people.  I am not sure whether this applies to the companies that bottle Coca Cola in countries other than the US.  10 November 2013 (Caribbean islands demand compensation for the slave trade)  Caribbean islands demand compensation for the slave trade from the European countries that ran it.  The book Inequality by Design, by Fischer et al, explains how discrimination against a minority group has a pernicious effect that continues to affect their descendants. The descendants of the slaves are still suffering today from the crime committed against them.  The country that most deserves such compensation is Haiti. Haiti was made to pay a lot of money for its independence, which is why Haiti is so poor and indebted. Haitians deserve to get all that money back.  10 November 2013 (Convincing people to support action to curb global heating)  Suggested arguments for convincing people to support action to curb global heating.  10 November 2013 (Local thugs joining in massive surveillance)  Local thugs in the US are joining in massive surveillance.  10 November 2013 (Power Plants and Other Vital Systems Are Totally Exposed on the Internet)  Power Plants and Other Vital Systems Are Totally Exposed on the Internet.  10 November 2013 (Polio spreading to Middle East from Pakistan)  Polio is spreading to the Middle East from Pakistan, where religious lunatics kill vaccination teams.  10 November 2013 (People get fired for using legalized pot)  Even in states which have legalized pot, people get fired for using it.  One disadvantage of the US is that companies can fire employees for almost anything, with a few special exceptions.  10 November 2013 (U.S. Manufacturing Only Has Jobs for the Skilled Few)  U.S. Manufacturing Only Has Jobs for the Skilled Few.  Self-driving cars cut put 2 or 3 million Americans out of work, if we allow them to. Why not ban them?  10 November 2013 (UK gov't cruel treatment to children of illegal immigrants)  The UK government is dishing out cruel treatment to children of illegal immigrants, as a scheme to discourage immigration.  10 November 2013 (Urgent: Don't let JP Morgan get a tax deduction for its penalty)  US citizens: phone Attorney General Holder and say, don't let JP Morgan get a tax deduction for its penalty.  10 November 2013 (Urgent: What has become of political prisoner Nadya Tolokonnikova)  Everyone: demand that Russia say what has become of political prisoner Nadya Tolokonnikova.  10 November 2013 (Urgent: Mike Bishop's case against the Keystone XL)  US citizens: tell Obama to drop his opposition to Mike Bishop's case against the Keystone XL planet roaster pipeline.  10 November 2013 (Voters prove vulnerable to manipulation)  American voters prove vulnerable to manipulation when companies launder money to pay for political advertisements.  Voters approved many other progressive ballot initiatives.  Americans need to learn that expensive political ads represent their enemy.  10 November 2013 (Urgent: Strong limits on CO2 emissions from new power plants)  US citizens: tell the EPA you want strong limits on CO2 emissions from new power plants.  10 November 2013 (A chance to comment on the dangers of TAFTA)  The US government gave civil society organizations a chance to comment on the dangers of TAFTA, if they can afford to fly to Brussels on one week's notice.  TAFTA stands for "Turn All Freedom To Ashes", and if you are not in favor of that goal, they don't want to hear from you.  10 November 2013 (Urgent: Commit not to buy sugar from land-grabbers)  Everyone: call on Pepsico to follow Coca Cola Company and commit not to buy sugar from land-grabbers.  10 November 2013 (Biomass as an energy source)  Biomass as an energy source is renewable in principle, but if that means burning wood, it could also mean deforestation.  10 November 2013 (IPCC chairman on planet)  IPCC chairman: Are we prepared to "pass on a lousy, spoilt and defiled planet"?  10 November 2013 (Urgent: Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act)  US citizens: support the Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act.  10 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose coal export terminal in Washington State)  US citizens: oppose a proposed coal export terminal in Washington State.  10 November 2013 (Urgent: Employment Non-Discrimination Act)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which the Senate just passed. Also send a message through this page.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  10 November 2013 (Unjust trade trade treaty between US and Europe thwarted)  The scandal about NSA spying in Europe has temporarily thwarted plans for a new, unjust trade treaty between the US and Europe, TTIP.  This proposed treaty is also called TAFTA, or "Turn All Freedom to Ashes", and it is likely to be similar to the TPP. Any "trade" treaty that the US government proposes nowadays is likely to be an instrument to give business more power and undermine democracy.  10 November 2013 (Coal industry forum in Poland)  While Poland hosts negotiations to consider perhaps saving the Earth's biosphere, it also contemptuously holds a coal industry forum.  10 November 2013 (David Eckert's forced colonoscopy)  More on David Eckert's forced colonoscopy.  I think it is abuse of language and common sense to stretch the word "rape" to include a forced medical procedure. Rape is not the only sort of wrong; if we want to criticize something, we don't need to scrape up an excuse to call it "rape".  10 November 2013 (Walmart workers protest)  Walmart workers held the largest protest ever.  I nearly always avoid Walmart.  10 November 2013 (Colon searches in Deming)  Eckert wasn't the only person in Deming whose colon was searched for drugs based on no evidence.  10 November 2013 (Possibility of nuclear agreement with Iran)  Might Netanyahu launch an attack on Iran to sabotage the possibility of a nuclear agreement?  10 November 2013 (Food industry wants to ban states from requiring GMO labeling)  The food industry wants the US government to ban states from requiring labeling of GMOs.  10 November 2013 (Tony B'liar's advice on "good governance")  Tony B'liar's advice on "good governance" has not led Kazakhstan to respect human rights any better. It has got worse since he started.  The argument that Kazakhstan is "an important country" is a red herring.  10 November 2013 (Sheik declared "terrorist" without trial)  Sheik Yassin Kadi was declared a "terrorist" by the US and then by the UN, without a trial, based on accusations kept secret from him.  This is the natural result of the laws that ban organizations by declaring them "terrorist", without a trial. Such laws are inherently unjust and all of them must be repealed.  10 November 2013 (Countries learning to reject unjust trade treaties)  Several governments are learning to reject unjust trade treaties.  Too bad the US is not one of them.  10 November 2013 (Pollution from jewellery and other chemical processing)  Argentina, Indonesia and Nigeria among World's Top 10 Most Polluted Places Due to Jewellery And Other Chemical Processing.  09 November 2013 (Urgent: No shipping of toxic fracking waste on rivers)  US citizens: tell the Coast Guard not to allow toxic fracking waste to be shipped on rivers. A barge accident could pollute water supplies.  09 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose bill that weakens the EPA)  US citizens: call on your congresscritter and senators to oppose a bill to deny the EPA the power to regulate carbon pollution from power plants.  09 November 2013 (Urgent: Honest judgment of Keystone XL by the EPA)  US citizens: call on the EPA to judge the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline honestly and not join the State Department's greenwash.  09 November 2013 (Urgent: Enforcement of law to protect marine mammals)  US citizens: call for enforcement of the law to protect marine mammals from fishing.  09 November 2013 (IPCC report links climate change to anticipated global food scarcity)  Leaked IPCC Report Links Climate Change to (coming) Global Food Scarcity. The problem is already affecting food production in the US.  09 November 2013 (Judges demands ICRC reports on conditions at Guantanamo prison)  Judge Demands US Gov't Hand Over Secret Docs Detailing Gitmo Torture.  I understand the ICRC's reason for not publishing its reports on how states treat prisoners. I'm not convinced that the ICRC's reputation for confidentiality will be significantly impugned if a state publishes the report that the IRCR made about that state.  09 November 2013 (UK to quash torture case with new court procedure)  The UK intends to quash a torture case using a new secret court procedure, in which the state can present evidence to the judge while concealing it from the torture victims and their lawyers.  The government's witnesses, testifying in secret, could lie like a Clapper, confident that no one will have the chance to investigate to find facts to put up against their testimony.  09 November 2013 (MPs squander opportunity to question UK surveillance organizations)  MPs ordered the heads of UK surveillance organizations to testify in Parliament, and squandered the opportunity by giving them easy questions.  The spymasters told us nothing, just repeated their usual bogus arguments in favor of spying on everyone.  09 November 2013 (Saudi Arabia funds new group of Islamist Sunni rebels in Syria)  Saudi Arabia is funding a new group of Islamist Sunni rebels in Syria, this time excluding al Qa'ida.  This exclusion of al Qa'ida removes one reason why the US would oppose it, but they would seek to oppress Shi'ite, Christian and secular Syrians with a tyranny comparable to that of Saudi Arabia.  09 November 2013 (Proposed coal mine in Borneo)  A proposed giant coal mine in Borneo could cause deforestation locally, wiping out orangutans (and many other species), but the revenge on the rest of the world will take the form of global heating and ocean acidification.  09 November 2013 (War on Drugs)  We need to end the War on Drugs, and not just for marijuana.  09 November 2013 (Horoscopes)  What horoscopes would look like if astrology were really valid.  09 November 2013 (Mayor de Blasio must deal with effects of global heating on NYC)  Bill de Blasio, New York's first day-mayor (*) in several decades, will have to deal with protecting New York City from the effects of global heating, as well as the problem of housing used by rich people for vacations. As global heating accelerates, some areas will have to be abandoned. * Giuliani and Bloomberg were night-mayors.   09 November 2013 (How NSA instructs its speakers to defend massive surveillance)  The NSA instructed its speakers to defend massive surveillance with a vague reference to the September 2001 attacks. In effect, an allusion to the idea that we're supposed to believe their spying on all of us protected us from something more dangerous than a nondemocratic government.  09 November 2013 (Other NSA staff inspired by Snowden)  The Government Accountability Project says that other NSA staff are revealing information, inspired by Snowden.  09 November 2013 (Hidden mental scars from solitary confinement)  Solitary confinement produces hidden mental scars, and in New York State prisoners are put in solitary confinement for ridiculous arbitrary reasons.  09 November 2013 (Five reasons to ban depleted uranium from weapons and armor)  Five reasons to ban depleted uranium from weapons and armor.  If the US were ever invaded, we could not dare use tanks with depleted uranium armor, or fire the DU shells &mdash; it would be less damaging to surrender.  09 November 2013 (Deforestation in Sumatra)  What's the right strategy to end deforestation in Sumatra?  09 November 2013 (Strongest hurricane ever recorded over land)  The Philippines was just struck by the strongest hurricane ever recorded over land.  Global heating causes increasingly strong storms  and rising sea level, which combine to cause ever more damage.  09 November 2013 (UK marine convicted of murdering a prisoner)  A UK marine was convicted of murdering a prisoner in Afghanistan.  09 November 2013 (Global heating denying celebrities)  Global heating denying celebrities stem from the corporate-funded astroturf "wise use" movement in the 80s.  With their bogus scientific claims rejected, they move to the free market fundamentalist think tanks of the cult of the invisible hand. ("Whatever the market does is right, by definition, even if it makes everyone suffer.") Those circles don't care if the science is wrong as long as it supports their faith.  09 November 2013 (Egypt's military announced schedule for elections)  Egypt's military government announced a schedule for elections next year.  I hope this is sincere, but I would not count on it.  09 November 2013 (Netanyahu is making wild threats)  Netanyahu is making wild threats over the possible nuclear deal with Iran.  09 November 2013 (Game of tag is not allowed)  A school in Canada has prohibited children from touching each other. The game of tag is not allowed.  09 November 2013 (Google is using spyware in apps)  Google is using spyware in apps to track phone users into physical stores.  09 November 2013 (Unequally divided wealth and income in US)  A list of facts that show how unequally divided wealth and income are in the US.  09 November 2013 (Urgent: Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act)  US citizens: support the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act.  Here's what the bill does.  More info about a previous version of the bill.  09 November 2013 ("Unreasonable Force" In Chicago)  "Unreasonable Force" In Chicago Evidently Does Not Mean A Probably Drunk Cop Killing An Unarmed Guy Lying On the Ground By Shooting Him 16 Times.  07 November 2013 (Two proposed mines in Australia)  Two proposed mines in Australia would emit almost 4 billion tons of CO2 or equivalent.  This happens as investors are questioning fossil fuel companies about high valuations based on the carbon bubble.  07 November 2013 (The opposite of a carbon tax)  Governments' large subsidies to fossil fuel companies are in effect the opposite of a carbon tax.  Right wing governments are trying to skew funding even more in favor of fossil fuels.  These subsidies are a form of corruption: the fossil fuel companies have "invested" in looting the treasury.  07 November 2013 (Greece public broadcasting system)  Greece closed its public broadcasting system and fired all the employees, while starting a new public broadcasting system with different personnel.  The fired employees occupied the building for five months, publishing over the Internet, but the state has now sent thugs to force them out.  This move was equivalent to firing everyone and hiring other people. Why do that? Perhaps to pay them all less. Or to choose people who have less character, ethics or scruples.  07 November 2013 (The lies that defeated GMO labeling)  The lies that appear to have defeated GMO labeling in Washington.  07 November 2013 (FARC has reached peace agreement with state)  The FARC, Colombia's second-worst terrorist group, has reached a peace agreement in principle with the state.  The end of the guerrilla war between the FARC and the state would be a step forward, but I have to wonder what effect this will have on the fight against the Colombia's principal terrorist group, the right-wing paramilitares, which was closely associated with the previous president Alvaro Horrible.  Also, I am concerned that boosting President Santos might hurt the chances for electing a president that will tear up the unjust free exploitation treaty with the US.  07 November 2013 (Shell lied about damage caused by oil spills in Nigeria)  Amnesty International says Shell lied about damage caused by oil spills in Nigeria.  07 November 2013 (Urgent: Call on Senator Durbin not to sell us out)  US citizens: phone Senator Durbin's office and call on him not to cut Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare. No Grand Sellout!  07 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose sale of US national parks)  US citizens: tell Congress not to sell our national parks.  07 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose plan to allow more oil drilling in the Chukchi Sea)  US citizens: oppose a plan to allow even more oil drilling in the Chukchi Sea.   07 November 2013 (NYC jail keeps mentally ill prisoners in solitary confinement)  New York City's jail keeps mentally ill prisoners in solitary confinement, sometimes for years on end.  That's likely to make them sicker.  07 November 2013 (Thugs probe mans intestines because he clenched his buttocks)  Thugs got "doctors" to search David Eckhart's intestines 6 times just because he was seen clenching his buttocks.  The colonoscopy procedure has a certain degree of danger. That danger is worth while for people who have an a priori risk of colon cancer, but that cannot excuse applying it to anyone else.  07 November 2013 (Urgent: Oppose the TPP and the "fast track" for it)  US citizens: send a message to your congresscritter and senators to oppose the TPP and especially oppose "fast track" for it.  Here's the true nature of the TPP.  07 November 2013 (Urgent: Stop thugs from confiscating people's property at will)  US citizens: call for an end to the federal loophole that undermines state laws intended to stop thugs from confiscating people's property at will.  07 November 2013 (British journalist Sarah Harrison goes into exile)  British journalist Sarah Harrison has gone into exile fearing she will be accused of "terrorism" if she returns home.  07 November 2013 (French court orders Google to delete pages from search results)  A French court ordered Google to delete certain foreign web pages from search results.  This seems like dangerous censorship to me.  07 November 2013 (Safety of genetically modified foods)  A scientific-sounding article brushes quietly over reasons to reject genetically modified foods. It looks thoughtful but its reasoning is invalid.  It is clear that today's widely used GMOs are safe for most people to eat. If they caused harm to a substantial fraction of people, it would have shown up in medical statistics by now.  This does not imply that they don't cause allergies in some people. (I linked to a different report of such allergies.) Labeling GMOs is just what's needed to enable people with those allergies to avoid the problem &mdash; even if most of us can safely ignore it.  Meanwhile, today's GMOs cause big environmental problems. "Roundup-ready" plants have led to an increase in pesticide use, while Bt-toxin plants kill other insects besides the pests they are meant to kill.  If we wish to reject these crops to protect the environment, we should have that option. Why should agribusiness be allowed to conceal use of these crops from the public?  The veil comes down when the article makes a patently absurd claim that the probable defeat in Washington should affect our goals. That defeat shows the effect of agribusiness' millions, but has nothing to do with the question of what is good policy.  The lies that defeated GMO labeling  07 November 2013 (High level of polonium 210 found in Yasser Arafat's corpse)  A high level of polonium 210 was found in Yasser Arafat's corpse, suggesting he was killed with that poison.  Israel has a nuclear reactor (and nuclear weapons), and could easily make polonium 210. Arabs would find it difficult to obtain.  07 November 2013 (UK secrecy blocks report about decision to invade Iraq)  UK secrecy about communications between B'liar and Dubya is blocking the report about why they decided to invade Iraq.  07 November 2013 (Palm oil companies disregarding ethical commitments)  Large palm oil companies are disregarding the ethical commitments they made, and destroying forests in Africa and Asia.  07 November 2013 (US called on to investigate 18 killings in Afghanistan)  Human Rights Watch calls on the US to investigate 18 killings in Afghanistan in which US troops seem to have killed prisoners.  07 November 2013 (NY State issues order to block protests against drone base)  New York State has issued a "protective order" to block protests against a drone base.  07 November 2013 (Global heating)  Global heating will make dry regions drier, and this will undermine the life of the soil.  Geoengineering schemes designed to reflect sunlight away from the Earth would reduce global rainfall.  They would also fail to save the oceans from acidification which is likely to wipe out coral reefs and all the species that depend on them.  07 November 2013 (Big Pharma)  Why Big Pharma Won't Stop Breaking the Law.  07 November 2013 (Allergies and lack of biodiversity)  A lack of biodiversity in the nearby environment correlates with different bacteria on your skin, and a greater incidence of allergies.  07 November 2013 (Queensland extends unjust model of banning organizations by fiat)  Queensland (a state in Australia) has extended the unjust model of banning organizations by fiat, previously applied to supposed terrorists, to supposed motorcycle gangs.  06 November 2013 (Ireland bankrupted itself)  Ireland bankrupted itself by agreeing to pay for the losses of private banks. This led to austerity which only made things worse.  06 November 2013 (Initiative to require labeling of GMOs)  The Washington initiative to require labeling of GMOs has probably been defeated.  Companies put many millions into ads against labeling.  06 November 2013 (Million Mask March)  Protesters gather around the world for Million Mask March.  06 November 2013 (Subversion of judicial process)  A Google security expert accuses GCHQ of "subversion of judicial process".  The state has subverted its own judicial process for the sake of snooping of various kinds.  06 November 2013 (4 Foods That Could Disappear)  4 Foods That Could Disappear If New Food Safety Rules Pass.  06 November 2013 ("Foreign aid")  Lots of "foreign aid" is neither foreign nor aid.  I think cancellation of a poor country's debt is real aid, and urgently needed too. However, encouraging external investment is business in a country is not real aid, since investment tends to be predatory and subjugating (it leads to pressure to sign treaties with "investor-state" provisions that damage human rights).  06 November 2013 (Traders say they will prove oil companies have fixed prices)  Oil commodity traders say they will prove that big oil companies including Billionaire Polluters and Shell have fixed prices for a decade.  So, will our plutocratist governments jail the people responsible, or just fine the companies a small fraction of what they made from this?  06 November 2013 (Progressive Democrat elected Mayor of New York)  Progressive Democrat Bill de Blasio has been elected mayor of New York. This is a victory, though we will have to wait and see how much of one.  06 November 2013 (China pressuring Hollywood movie companies)  China is pressuring Hollywood movie companies to join its PR force.  Yet another reason we shouldn't go out of our way to help Hollywood &mdash; such by as tolerating nasty copyright restrictions and the War on Sharing, or by competing with other countries to offer movie production the biggest tax cut.  06 November 2013 (Urgent: Restore Dominican Republic citizenship for people of Haitian descent)  Everyone: call on the Dominican Republic to restore citizenship for people of Haitian descent.  06 November 2013 (US listening post in Berlin)  The US shut down its listening post in Berlin, so now it has to listen to the German government via the UK embassy.  Although US spying on foreign officials makes those officials angry, I consider that practice more acceptable, and less scandalous, than US spying on you, me and everyone.  06 November 2013 (Kenya's congress passes "code of conduct" law)  After reporters exposed theft by soldiers, Kenya's congress passed a law to fine or shut news media if they violate a "code of conduct" which will be decided later.  Even if the code is not unjust at first, it could be changed easily later.  06 November 2013 (Snowden, Assange, Manning, Vanunu and Kamm)  Snowden, Assange, Manning, Vanunu &mdash; The True Heroes Of Our Time.  Anat Kamm should be listed in the title, too.  06 November 2013 (Israel to demolish homes of 15,000 Arabs)  Israel has announced plans to demolish the homes of 15,000 Arabs in the areas Israel calls part of Jerusalem.  06 November 2013 (Gaza's electric plant shut down due to fuel shortage)  Gaza's electric plant is shut down because there is no fuel.  06 November 2013 (Israeli troops attack Palestinians trying to farm their land)  Some Palestinians tried to go to their farm land, but Israeli troops attacked them because Israeli colonists have built greenhouses on that land.  Sometimes the colonists even attack Israeli soldiers, and get away with it.  06 November 2013 (Israel applies separate laws for Israeli and Palestinian children)  Israel applies one law to Israeli children and another law to Palestinian children.  06 November 2013 (Norwegian journalists in Sochi repeatedly arrested)  Norwegian journalists in Sochi were repeatedly arrested and threatened with imprisonment, for no obvious reason.  06 November 2013 (American Psychological Association soft on torture)  The American Psychological Association is soft on torture.  06 November 2013 (More CO2 cuts needed to avoid disaster)  The UN reports that the CO2-reduction targets of the countries in the world won't be enough to avoid global heating disaster. Much more cuts are needed by 2020.  An OECD study found that a carbon tax is the most efficient way to achieve cuts of whatever level.  06 November 2013 (Surrender of the M23 rebels in the DR Congo)  More about the surrender of the M23 rebels in the DR Congo.  06 November 2013 (Loan companies advertising to children)  If advertising tobacco to children wasn't bad enough, now loan companies are doing it.  06 November 2013 (UK snoops on undersea cables from base in Cyprus)  The UK snoops on many undersea cables from its base in Cyprus.  06 November 2013 (Argentina's new biometric ID system)  Argentina's New Biometric ID System Ignores Right to Privacy.  This system (SIBIOS) is why I decided not to go to Argentina again. (Sorry, that article is in Spanish.)  06 November 2013 (Six Journalists Given Life Sentences in Turkey)  Six Journalists Given Life Sentences in Turkey.  06 November 2013 (End of rebellion in Congo)  The rebellion in the Congo (DRC) seems to have ended.  The fighting in that region tends to be due to rivalry between mineral-trafficking gangs that supply the demands of users in wealthier countries. Some of these gangs are known as "governments" while others are called "rebels". The fighting flares up when the gangs disagree about what share each gang will get. People are better off when the gang structure is stable and nobody is getting shot.  05 November 2013 (Former FBI agent refutes bogus argument for massive surveillance)  Mike German, former FBI agent, refutes the bogus arguments for massive surveillance.  Even if general surveillance did protect us from terrorists, it makes us vulnerable to a much bigger danger: the rogue state.  05 November 2013 (Greek Protesters Rally Against IMF And EU Inspection)  Greek Protesters Rally Against IMF And EU Inspection.  05 November 2013 (China's plan to reduce smog will increase CO2 emission)  China's plan to reduce smog by replacing coal will result in doubling the CO2 emission the coal was producing.  05 November 2013 (Almond production drops due to death of honeybees)  The death of honeybees has caused a drop in almond production in California, and a shortage.  05 November 2013 (UK massive surveillance violates European human rights law)  UK massive surveillance appears to violate European human rights law.  05 November 2013 (Snowden's open letter to Germany)  Edward Snowden's open letter to Germany.  On Snowden's prospects of being given asylum in Germany.  Amnesty International says that prosecuting Snowden would make him a political prisoner.  05 November 2013 (Kerry wants to proceed with plans to render democracy powerless)  Kerry asks Europe not to let the dispute about NSA surveillance interfere with joint plans for a trade treaty to render democracy powerless.  05 November 2013 (Dawkins on Voluntary-Public-Spirit)  Richard Dawkins raised a public issue that affects all of us, using his bottle of honey as an example; people criticized him as if he only cared about that bottle.  05 November 2013 (Undercover UK thugs to be tried in secret court)  The human rights lawsuit against undercover UK thugs, by the lovers they tricked, has been buried in a secret court that is designed to be unfair in favor of the state.  05 November 2013 (Reducing poverty)  Planning to cut US poverty in half over the next ten years.  The question is whether we can reduce poverty faster than the plutocrats can crank out more.  05 November 2013 (Obama's sellouts to the meat industry)  Obama's sellouts to the meat industry.  05 November 2013 (Ethiopian journalist imprisoned for 18 years)  Ethiopian journalist Eskinder Nega has been imprisoned for 18 years for calling for democracy, along with many other supporters of human rights.  05 November 2013 (The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is not strong enough)  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is not strong enough; it has a religious loophole.  It's not just gay staff that face the threat of discrimination when a secular hospital merges with a religious one; the patients do, too. We should require religious hospitals to provide all sorts of care that patients are entitled to, including abortions; if the church doesn't like it, it can sell the hospital to a foundation.  05 November 2013 (Marshall Islands' inhabitants trying to live sustainably)  The Marshall Islands' inhabitants are trying to live sustainably, and hoping that the rest of the world will follow their example rather than inundating them.  05 November 2013 (New Zealand passed US-style law)  New Zealand has passed a US-style law requiring telecommunications companies to implement interception facilities.  I don't think such facilities are bad in themselves; however, the state must not be able to use them unmonitored.  05 November 2013 (Democracy activists calling for tourist boycott)  Democracy activists in the Maldives are calling for a tourist boycott to pressure the state to allow a free election; meanwhile, the state has made it a crime to advocate that boycott.  This reminds me of the Israeli law that threatens to bankrupt anyone that advocates the boycott of products made in Israel's colonies in Palestinian territory.  05 November 2013 (Obama's drone attacks)  Judging Obama's drone attacks against international law finds that many of them are crimes.  05 November 2013 (Offering men paternity leave to match women's maternity leave)  Offering men paternity leave to match women's maternity leave could indirectly reduce employment discrimination against women.  05 November 2013 (Former congressman denied a voting ID)  A former congressman was denied a voting ID under the state's tough new voter suppression law.  05 November 2013 (Brazil accused of hypocrisy for minor forms of surveillance)  Brazil is being accused of hypocrisy for minor forms of surveillance such as following foreign diplomats' cars.  I don't see anything wrong with the practices described here, which are aimed at specific people that there is a specific reason to be suspicious of. It isn't wrong for the US to do this sort of surveillance, either. What makes US surveillance an injustice is that it is massive and general, aimed at all Americans.  05 November 2013 (Global heating is making polar bears starve)  Global heating is making polar bears starve, so in part of Canada a few of them try to eat humans.  We can't blame the polar bears. They don't understand global heating; we do.  05 November 2013 (Iranian "reformist" newspaper closed)  An Iranian "reformist" newspaper has been closed, reminding us that even if Iran makes a deal about uranium enrichment, it will still be a theocratic tyranny.  05 November 2013 (ALEC's "transparency" initiative)  ALEC's "transparency" initiative omits important information, compared with what as been obtained in the past through open-records requests.  05 November 2013 (Cowardly leftish politics)  Cowardly leftish politics: instead of adopting a livable minimum wage, "reward" the businesses for paying enough.  If we keep on giving employers tax cuts instead of requirements, soon they won't have any tax to dodge, and we'll all be taxed to pay for their "incentives".  04 November 2013 (Urgent: Hold China to account)  Everyone: call for holding China to account as it seeks to join the UN Human Rights Council.  04 November 2013 (Urgent: Support negotiation with Iran)  US citizens: show support for negotiation with Iran.  04 November 2013 (Greenpeace activist reports on prison conditions in Russia)  One of the Greenpeace 30 reports on prison conditions in Russia.  Note how the Australian government refuses to help him. That's because it works for the fossil fuel companies.  04 November 2013 (Morsi on trial)  Morsi, on trial, condemned the military coup.  He may very well be guilty of some crime, but the military's crimes are so much bigger that they make this trial absurd. The Muslim Brotherhood advocates disrespect for human rights (for instance, the right to change from being a Muslim to being anything else), but shooting protesters dead on the street is also violating human rights.  04 November 2013 (Doctors told by US gov't to participate in torture of prisoners)  An organization of doctors says the US government told doctors and psychologists to participate in torture of prisoners.  04 November 2013 (Nobel Prize in Economics given for unfounded hypotheses)  The Nobel Prize in Economics was given for unfounded economic hypotheses that economists like to believe because they support right-wing conclusions.  04 November 2013 (Safe nuclear power: easier said than done)  James Hansen calls for development of "safe nuclear power".  I respect him, but that is easier said than done. Some of the dangers would be addressed by using Thorium, but not all.  04 November 2013 (Abdolfattah Soltani starts hunger strike)  Imprisoned Iranian human rights defender Abdolfattah Soltani has started a hunger strike.  04 November 2013 (Seeing anything sexual is dangerous but violence is no problem)  Religious conservatism leads its believers to think that seeing anything sexual is dangerous for children, but seeing violence is no problem.  04 November 2013 (Executive order kept secret from Congress)  The NSA collects Americans' contact lists on the pretext that this is all "foreign intelligence", citing the authority of an executive order that has been kept secret from Congress.  04 November 2013 (Stranglehold over all areas of law)  The European Union plans to give foreign companies a stranglehold over all areas of law, through an "investor-state" treaty with the US.  To establish such a treaty in a democracy is treason.  04 November 2013 (Rich abandoning America)  America's rich are abandoning America, after extracting what they could get.  04 November 2013 (23 meters of sea level rise by 2100)  A new study forecasts 23 meters of sea level rise by 2100. Large parts of Boston would be under water, as well as Shanghai, Mumbai, Miami and more.  And that's just considering the normal sea level, not high tides and hurricanes.  04 November 2013 (Drug prohibition blocking brain research)  Drug prohibition is blocking brain research in the UK; promising treatments cannot be studied. The situation is similar in the US.  In the US, drug prohibition also attacks the use of existing medicine.  04 November 2013 (The Great Austerity Shell Game)  The Great Austerity Shell Game, which is the only way out until you tax the rich enough.  4 November 2013 (The UK Government's Decision)  The UK government's decision to interrogate David Miranda and threaten him with imprisonment was based on a document  that equated publication with terrorism. There you have it. Measures that strip people of their rights in the name of "fighting terrorism" will be used to attack freedom and democracy. These measures are far bigger threat than terrorism.  4 November 2013 (North Dakota Oil Spill)  North Dakota Oil Spill Spotlights Obama Delay on Rules  (about detecting leaks).  4 November 2013 (Why Prosecutors)  Why prosecutors to prosecute heroes like Swartz and Kiriakou,  rather than banksters. By the way, this also shows us why proposals to "reduce crime" by putting cameras on the street are missing the boat. If they want to make a real dent in crime, they should put the cameras in bank executives' offices.  4 November 2013 (Monopolies)  Resistance to plant variety monopolies and other restrictions of crops  is spreading in Latin America.  This generally admirable article falls for enemy propaganda when it treats the term "intellectual property" as if it were a principle. It is nothing but a way of lumping together various unrelated laws, one of which is the law of plant variety monopolies. These laws don't have anything meaningful in common, but the propaganda term leads people to think that they do, or should. Therefore, I never use it, and when I see it used, I explain how it is misleading.  See for more explanation,  4 November 2013 (Economic Growth) The paradigm of economic growth, as typically understood today,  is anti-life. It is not inevitable for economic growth to be anti-life; but if people formulate their thoughts in terms of economic growth and never mind how, it could come out that way.  4 November 2013 (Tesco) Going to shop in Tesco's?  Wear an Anonymous mask.   4 November 2013 (Industry)  The fossil fuel industry's pet government in Australia has approved a giant coal mine, never mind that running it will cause  a local water shortage.  4 November 2013 (Workers) As many as two million workers are  on strike in Indonesia.  03 November 2013 (UK to deport witness before she can testify)  The UK plans to deport a witness to sexual intimidation of immigration prisoners before she can testify about it.  03 November 2013 (The arrest and interrogation of David Miranda)  UK thugs say they arrested and interrogated David Miranda as a suspected "terrorist" because he stood for a "political or ideological cause".  UK Claim That 'Journalism Equals Terrorism' Sparks Outrage.  The law they used is ripe for such misuse because it gives the state far too much power to begin with. The idea of limiting its use to "real terrorists" is a pipedream. The powers must be reduced.  03 November 2013 (Use of dangerously loud sound as a weapon)  Blasting people with loud sounds (even if it's music) is dangerous. It can even cause permanent injury.  03 November 2013 (New coverage of Obama's health care law)  Cancelling Americans' health care plans rarely received news coverage until it got connected with Obama's health care law.  03 November 2013 (Defending freedom of the press is "anti-government activism")  The government of Sri Lanka says that defending freedom of the press is "anti-government activism."  Since they said so themselves, there's no room for doubt.  03 November 2013 (Massive collection of phone call data of people in France and Spain)  Looking closely at NSA statements, it's not clear that the massive collection of phone call data of people in France and Spain is entirely made with the help of the governments of France and Spain. The NSA may do some of the collection directly.  This detail doesn't alter the wrongness of the activity, or even who's culpable. It only affects what fraction of the practice the French and Spanish governments are culpable for.  03 November 2013 (Life in prison for throwing stones at Israeli occupation soldiers)  A Palestinian teenager faces the threat of life in prison for throwing stones at Israeli occupation soldiers.  Whether the teenager really threw stones, we have no way of knowing, since the torture and brainwashing applied to Palestinian children in Israeli prisons can easily lead to false confessions.  03 November 2013 (Urgent: Reject proposals to sabotage negotiations with Iran)  US citizens: call on your senators to reject proposals to sabotage negotiations with Iran.  03 November 2013 (Israeli colonies in Palestinian land)  The built-up housing of the Israeli colonies in Palestinian land are just a small fraction. Lots of farm land has been taken too.  03 November 2013 (Jewish activists met with repression and arbitrary arrest)  Jewish activists who went to Hebron to oppose segregation met with repression and arbitrary arrest by the thugs.  The purpose of laws is to prevent the state from acting arbitrarily. In Israel, they don't achieve that.  03 November 2013 (A nonviolent secular Palestinian movement)  Mustafah Barghouti, MD, leads a nonviolent secular Palestinian movement that goes up against Fatah and Hamas.  03 November 2013 (The Jewish National Fund)  The Jewish National Fund does not only help implement expulsion of Palestinian villages, it also participates in choosing the plans to do so.  03 November 2013 (Statement by the activists facing prosecution in France)  A statement by the activists facing prosecution in France for advocating a boycott of Israeli products.  The page contains the text in French, followed by the English translation.  03 November 2013 (Netanyahu's party is campaigning on racism)  Netanyahu's party is campaigning based on racism against Israeli Arabs.  03 November 2013 (Israeli colonists attacked Palestinians)  Israeli colonists attacked Palestinians who were harvesting their olive crop, including beating one of them with a metal pole.  Since the time and place of harvesting were predictable, the Israeli thugs and soldiers were able to be elsewhere during the attack.  Other Palestinians can only get to the fields with the help of Israeli peace volunteers, whose presence compels the thugs to restrain their cruelty just a little.  The Israeli thugs have found the culprits for around 3% of the reported attacks against Palestinians' olive trees.  03 November 2013 (Putin's unpredictable and slow repression)  Putin's unpredictable and slow repression has crushed opposition.  03 November 2013 (The enforcement of abortion restrictions)  The enforcement of abortion restrictions (which are unjust in themselves, of course) leads to further oppression of women.  03 November 2013 (Urgent: Call on AAMCO to stop supporting Rush Limbaugh)  In the US: call on AAMCO to stop supporting Rush Limbaugh.  03 November 2013 (Revlon threatens to sue Breast Cancer Fund)  Revlon threatened to sue the Breast Cancer Fund for running a petition criticizing carcinogens in Revlon products.  I don't know whether there is a significant problem with those products, but this response is a wrong in itself.  03 November 2013 (Engagement rings)  The exploitative "tradition" of engagement rings was created by a marketing campaign during the 20th century.  Like many exploitative "traditions", this one takes advantage of some people's vulnerability to competitive consumption.  I've always felt an intuitive revulsion for such practices, the things that you're supposed to do "for" people you know whether they do any good or not. At some point in my teens I opted out from birthday presents and birthday cards. Not only did I resent the pointless effort of giving them, I didn't want to impose on anyone the pointless effort of giving them to me.  03 November 2013 (Hint in Chinese reporter's confession)  Chinese reporter Chen Yongzhou included a hint in his confession to show it was false.  03 November 2013 (Bassem Youssef, Egyptian Jon Stewart, faces censorship)  Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef faces censorship by the TV channel as well as prosecution by the military government.  03 November 2013 (Israel in 90 years)  Uri Avnery speaks about what kind of Israel will exist in 90 years.  02 November 2013 (When Did "To Serve & Protect" Become "To Seize & Profit?")  When Did "To Serve & Protect" Become "To Seize & Profit?"  02 November 2013 (Use of supposedly pest-resistant GMO cotton)  Use of supposedly pest-resistant GMO cotton has led small Indian farmers to use more pesticide, and has not increased their production. They used it because the Indian government effectively pushed them to use it.  02 November 2013 (House of Representatives voted to exempt derivatives from bank regulations)  The House of Representatives voted to exempt derivatives from bank regulations, using a text written for them by Citibank.  Too bad Obama doesn't want to confront the banksters strongly. He is more on their side than ours.  02 November 2013 (Many women in Saudi Arabia endorse extreme sexism)  Many women in Saudi Arabia endorse the extreme sexism of their own society.  It is clear that these women occupy rather privileged positions. Most Saudis are not rich, and the women who are not rich are not treated like queens. Nonetheless, it is interesting to see how patriarchy convinces women to support patriarchy.  02 November 2013 (NIST will audit its encryption-related standards)  NIST says it will audit all its encryption-related standards to see if the NSA has sabotaged them.  02 November 2013 (Urgent: Stop unfair dismissal of pregnant workers)  US citizens: call for action to stop unfair dismissal of pregnant workers.  02 November 2013 (Urgent: Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act)  US citizens: support the Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act.  02 November 2013 (Urgent: Gender identity nondiscrimination bill)  US citizens: call on Senate Republicans to stop the filibuster against the gender identity nondiscrimination bill.  02 November 2013 (Urgent: Maintain and increase social security benefits)  US citizens: sign this open letter to maintain and increase social security benefits.  02 November 2013 (Use of symbol punished by Egypt's military gov't)  Egypt's military government is punishing use of a symbol used by Morsi supporters, and investigating TV comedian Bassem Youssef.  02 November 2013 (Disappeared journalists and dissidents in Sri Lanka)  Relatives of disappeared journalists and dissidents in Sri Lanka asked the UK to put pressure on Rajapaksa's government, which they suspect was responsible.  02 November 2013 (Mass surveillance in European countries)  Several European countries have developed mass surveillance in cooperation with the UK's surveillance agency GCHQ, which also helped them shrug off legal limitations.  02 November 2013 (Increase of income-segregation in the US)  Income-segregation in the US has increased greatly in the past few decades.  02 November 2013 (Neoclassical economics)  Economics students call for education in models other than neoclassical.  Neoclassical economics is based on a long list of assumptions that are often not true in real life.  See also.  02 November 2013 (Grandchildren of Mamana Bibi testify about drone attack)  The grandchildren of Mamana Bibi testified to the US Congress about the drone attack that killed her.  02 November 2013 (Chinese water boilers with WiFi devices)  Reportedly Chinese water boilers have been found with WiFi devices designed to do some harm.  02 November 2013 (The harm imposed on Americans by ALEC-supported laws)  A survey of the harm that ALEC-supported laws have imposed on ordinary Americans.  02 November 2013 (Congress should arrange to give Edward Snowden amnesty)  Congress should arrange to give Edward Snowden amnesty.  He deserves the highest possible honors from the US and every country.  02 November 2013 (UK gov't to pay public defenders to betray their clients)  The UK government plans to pay public defenders to betray their clients, rewarding these lawyers for every guilty plea.  02 November 2013 (Gifts from summit meeting in Russia try to invade computers)  Attendees at a summit meeting in Russia received official gifts that try to invade their computers.  Can anyone verify whether GNU/Linux systems are safe from them?  02 November 2013 (Australian media on global heating)  In Australian media, almost 1/3 of the articles that mention global heating cast doubt on its causation by human activity.  02 November 2013 (Uruguay removing troops from UN force in Haiti)  Uruguay is removing its troops from the UN force that keeps Haiti down.  02 November 2013 (Hamburg's plan to cope with effects of global heating)  Hamburg has a plan to cope with the effects of global heating by helping people walk and bicycle around the city.  02 November 2013 (The protest that stopped NY Thug Commissioner from speaking at Brown)  An article by one who joined the protest that stopped New York Thug Commissioner Kelly from speaking at Brown University.  The event celebrated repression, surveillance and attacks on democracy.  It deserved a protest. The information in the article suggests that some part of the university has sold itself to the forces of repression. I think a long-term campaign to change that is called for.  Despite that, I don't think that they should have prevented the speech from occurring, because that turns into censorship.  02 November 2013 (Hillary Clinton's speeches at Goldman Sachs)  Hillary Clinton was probably paid $400,000 for speeches at Goldman Sachs.  We can hardly expect her to do anything about the banksters' political power. I am almost certain I will vote Green again.  02 November 2013 (US court imposes secrecy on report about a product's safety)  A US court has imposed secrecy on a report that some product might be dangerous. The public can't tell what product it was.  02 November 2013 (US-Iran talks)  Can Congress, Hawks and the Israel Lobby Wreck the US-Iran Talks?  02 November 2013 (US gov't tries to stop sale of shirts with parodies of gov't logos)  The US government is trying to stop someone from selling shirts with parodies of logos of certain US government departments.  02 November 2013 ("Suspicious Activity Report" systems)  ACLU: The US government spreads around any strange rumor that citizens call in as "suspicious" for whatever reason.  02 November 2013 (Complications in Obama's health care program)  The complication of the servers in Obama's health care program reflects the wasteful complexity of the law, which results from Congress and Obama's unwillingness to set up a national health service.  The web site does not protect people's personal data from third parties.  Of course, it doesn't protect them from the state either. Although the US does not have the benefits of a national health service, its digital health records are quite easily available to the state.  31 October 2013 (Urgent: Oppose oil trains)  US citizens: tell the US Department of Transportation not to allow dangerous oil trains.  31 October 2013 (Egypt's equivalent of Jon Stewart threatened with prosecution)  Egypt's equivalent of Jon Stewart is threatened with prosecution for "insulting the military."  For insulting someone or something to be a crime is always an injustice.  31 October 2013 (Coastal hunting of porpoises and small whales)  Coastal hunting of porpoises and small whales in Japan kills thousands of them and could endanger some species. Some species may already have been hunted so far down they can't recover.  They may take revenge on people who eat the meat.  31 October 2013 (Cables connecting Google and Yahoo data centers tapped by NSA)  Another Snowden document says that the NSA has tapped cables connecting various Google and Yahoo data centers.  31 October 2013 (Syria's chemical weapons production facilities destroyed)  Syria's chemical weapons production and packaging facilities have been destroyed.  Destroying the weapons that already exist will take longer.  31 October 2013 (UK to require companies to disclose who owns them)  The UK will cut off one avenue for tax dodging, by requiring all companies to inform the public who really owns them.  This is important progress, but there are many other avenues for tax dodging.  01 November 2013 (Panhandlers in San Francisco getting under $25 per day)  A survey of panhandlers in San Francisco found that most of them get under $25 per day. Less than half take drugs or alcohol.  The US should be ashamed of doing so little for the poor that they need to do this.    &lt;&lt; Next (2014 March - June) | 2013 November - February | Previous (2013 July - October) >>  Each note starts with a date and a brief topic in parentheses.

Link Policy       28 October 2014 (UK attack on the poor)  The UK attack on the poor has gone so far that poor people must steal food to eat &mdash; or steal more expensive things in order to get into jail.  People who are hungry are entitled to steal food.  28 October 2014 (Life under the rule of PISSI)  Some people in Mosul say that life under the rule of PISSI is a disaster even if you're not being singled out for punishment.  This suggests they would be glad to have the chance for a government that won't repress them. The problem is where that could come from.  28 October 2014 (Australian plan to "protect" the Great Barrier Reef)  The Australian plan to "protect" the Great Barrier Reef ignores the damage that global heating will do.  28 October 2014 (Turning old camera phones into remote surveillance cameras)  A company wants to pay people to turn old camera phones into remote surveillance cameras.  How is this different from stationing a human there to count people? They couldn't afford to station humans full time in very many places. And if they argue that they don't or can't recognize individuals, what assurance do we have that they won't be recognizing individuals using the same technique 10 years from now?  I think it should be illegal to set up a camera looking for more than a short time at a place where the public is admitted, if it makes the video remotely accessible. Individuals, and especially the state, should have to get a court order before they can do this.  28 October 2014 (Voting by email)  New Jersey's emergency experiment with voting by email ran into various practical problems in addition to the fundamental ones you'd expect, and there is no way of knowing how many votes were lost.  It is amusing how the artificial concern with voter fraud, stoked to provide a basis for stopping poor and disabled people from voting, is not applied to internet voting.  28 October 2014 (Fear of Ebola)  Fear of Ebola elicits bizarre reactions.  Hoax news contributes to the panic.  Ironically, Ebola is being used to spread computer viruses. But they probably can't hurt you if you are running GNU/Linux.  28 October 2014 (When foreign fighters want to leave PISSI)  When foreign fighters want to leave PISSI, it holds them prisoner and threatens to kill them.  Meanwhile, when Britons who went to Syria to fight against Assad go home because they don't support PISSI, the UK puts them in prison.  28 October 2014 (Capturing and centralizing the internet)  Giant web site companies are capturing and centralizing the internet, so that now 30 companies generate half the traffic in the US. They are converting it primarily into a broadcast medium.  I almost never access those companies' sites. In my view, the only good use of the internet is what they don't do.  Fortunately there is still enough of that to make a big difference from what the world was like before the internet.  28 October 2014 (Urgent: Oppose plan to make money laundering easier)  US citizens: oppose the Republican plan to make money laundering easier so as to help dishonest payday loan companies that make phony loans.  More information.  28 October 2014 (Unusual behavior on Amtrak)  On Amtrak, almost any unusual behavior is considered "suspicious" and is grounds for filing a report, perhaps arresting you, and perhaps stealing your money.  In practice it rarely happens to whites.  28 October 2014 (Compare US reaction)  Compare the US reaction to killings of US citizens by Israelis and by Palestinians.  27 October 2014 (UK slumlords)  UK slumlords evict tenants for complaining about unhealthy conditions.  27 October 2014 (Least religious generation in US history)  The US millennial generation is the least religious generation in US history. Churches are shrinking, and in the long term, the theocratic Christian right-wing is going to get weaker.  In effect, this election is the Christian fanatics' last chance at grabbing political power, and if they get it, the only way they can hold on to it is by denying the vote to those who will later take it away from them.  27 October 2014 (Silencing any view is tyranny)  Silencing Extreme Views, Even If They Are Those of Internet Trolls, Is Wrong.  It is not just wrong, it is tyranny.  27 October 2014 (Financial and technical "disruptions")  Financial "disruption" and technical "disruption" work together to track more, control more, and charge more.  27 October 2014 (UK's university system)  The UK's university system remains better than the US system in one way: the payments made by graduates depend on their incomes.  My main motive for going to college was fascination for learning. I hardly thought about making money afterward; I assumed I would become a professor but I rarely thought that far ahead. It was easy in the US in the 60s and 70s to follow an artistic or scholarly fascination and let income take care of itself, because the US still allowed most people a share in its income.  We should not blame today's students for giving high priority to their careers after they graduate, but the fact that they do so is a disadvantage for society. It will change when we get rid of plutocracy.  27 October 2014 (Authoritarian regime in Egypt)  In Egypt, an Authoritarian Regime Holds Sway Again.  27 October 2014 (Loss of Arctic ice)  The loss of Arctic ice has made severe winters in Eurasia twice as likely as before.  27 October 2014 (Woman executed in Iran)  A woman in Iran was executed for killing a man that she said was trying to rape her.  I believe her claim, especially since there was no other plausible account of what happened.  26 October 2014 (Right to sue)  1/3 of the most popular US web sites make users give up the right to sue over various sorts of mistreatment.  States should be prohibit this practice, but until they do, people should refuse to use sites that try to escape justice.  26 October 2014 (Many Britons switching to Green Party)  Many Britons are fed up with the right-wing Labour Party and are switching to the Green Party.  26 October 2014 (Local thug departments collecting people's phone call records)  Local thug departments in Virginia are collecting people's phone call records and redistributing them.  26 October 2014 (Apple's random hardware address)  Apple announced that iThings would randomize the WiFi hardware address to protect privacy, but it tuns out to do this only in unusual circumstances.  26 October 2014 (UK proposes a vague law)  The UK proposes a vague law to imprison computer users that "damage national security", including whistleblowers.  It is idiotic to pass a law against "using computers to do XYZ". If XYZ should be crime, what difference does it make whether it is done with a computer, with a pen, or however it might be?  26 October 2014 (Obama can work with Republicans just fine)  Obama can work with Republicans just fine when it comes to suppressing information about torture by the US government.  26 October 2014 (Fracking near New York State's Seneca lake)  Protesters blocked fracking near New York State's Seneca lake, which is a source of drinking water.  26 October 2014 (Europe's greenhouse gas pledge)  Greenpeace and other environmental groups say that Europe's greenhouse gas pledge is shamefully weak.  26 October 2014 (UK gov't spied on history professors)  The UK government spied on history professors who were members of the Communist party, even reading their mail, with no reason to suspect them of having anything but an opinion.  It spied on various academics and writers just because they agreed to a statement against nuclear weapons.  26 October 2014 (UK thugs repress protests)  UK thugs repress protests near Parliament to the point of arresting people for passing around bottles of water.  They are forced to hand over pizza boxes because the thugs say they might be useful for sleeping.  26 October 2014 (Time period of yellow lights)  The sleazy government of Chicago shortened the time period of yellow lights in order to trap motorists into more fines.  26 October 2014 (Gyroscopes in mobile phones)  Gyroscopes in mobile phones are so sensitive that they can pick up the sound of nearby voices. This allows apps to eavesdrop even if they are not allowed to use the microphone.  Note that this is a separate issue from conversion of phones into listening devices, which the NSA and other entities can do through the phone's universal back door. Thus, this facility doesn't make the phone more of a listening device than it was; but it does allow more parties to use it as a listening device.  26 October 2014 ('Koch Congress')  'Koch Congress' Could Make Oligarchy Official.  26 October 2014 (Protect us from&hellip;what?)  The NSA has to listen to everything to protect us from&hellip;what?  (The part I'm referring to is the first 8 slides. After that comes very technical material.)  The Committee to Protect Journalists says that US government resistance to encryption endangers journalists.  That is true, but the first and broadest danger to journalists comes from metadata: tracking who talks with whom.  26 October 2014 (Prison for cartoon)  A man in the UK has been sentenced for prison for having a cartoon depicting a fictional child in some sort of sexual situation.  The advocates of this kind of censorship started by saying they were trying to protect real children from being abused in order to take their photos. Making such photos should be a crime, and is a crime, but that is no reason to prohibit possessing copies of the photos.  However, they have already gone far beyond that. No child was harmed in drawing the cartoon.  To criminalize possession of copies of anything published &mdash; no matter what it is &mdash; is oppressive, and leads to many other forms of tyranny.  26 October 2014 (Pennsylvania's prisoner-gagging law)  Pennsylvania's prisoner-gagging law seems to be aimed first of all to gag Mumia abu-Jamal.  26 October 2014 (Urgent: Stop collection of your data)  US citizens: announce your general support for campaigning against collecting your data.  26 October 2014 (Fanatics threaten activist with death)  An activist set up events for Malaysians to get used to petting dogs, and is now getting death threats from religious fanatics.  26 October 2014 (Islamist rebels in Egypt)  Islamist rebels in Egypt have a persistent campaign of attacking Egyptian soldiers.  These rebels deserve condemnation for seeking to impose the rules of their religion on everyone, which tramples their human rights.  However, when al-Sisi calls them "terrorists", that is a lie. Terrorism means attacking civilians; attacking soldiers or state institutions is rebellion.  Al-Sisi calls even peaceful opposition "terrorism".  26 October 2014 (US media exploiting Ebola)  US media are trying to exploit Ebola by spreading panic about anyone who might have come anywhere near it.  This is having political results already from politicians that want to look tough.  Americans interested in helping to treat sick people in Africa will now either (1) return home through some other place or (2) decide not to go.  These people should take precautions, but it isn't necessary to lock them up, costing them their jobs and perhaps making them homeless afterward.  26 October 2014 ('Moral slide' of intel agencies)  MI6 Whistleblower's Partner Accuses Intelligence Agencies of 'Moral Slide'.  26 October 2014 (CIA torture report delays)  Frustrated CIA Blames Torture Report Delays on Senators Who Want It To Be Intelligible.  The right thing for the senators to do is to publish what they see fit and tell the CIA to jump in the lake. And then start a new Church Committee investigation that will tear the CIA open from top to bottom. You can't stop its abuses while handling it with kid gloves.  26 October 2014 (Liberian burial rituals)  People in Liberia are clinging to traditional burial rituals to the point of killing their relatives and killing themselves.  They kill their relatives by denying them treatment for whatever disease they have. They kill themselves by washing and handling the bodies of the dead, some of whom died of Ebola.  They are acting like idiots, but they don't deserve the consequence that they are bringing on themselves.  26 October 2014 (PISSI chemical weapons accusations)  There are accusations that PISSI has used chemical weapons on a few occasions on a small scale.  I have to wonder: since Saddam Hussein destroyed his chemical weapons, how did any survive.  26 October 2014 (Fanatics demand punishment of journalists)  Muslim fanatics in Afghanistan demand the punishment of journalists who wrote an article that they believe criticizes their religion.  Shame on anyone whose religion includes believing people are not allowed to insult it.  26 October 2014 (Not enough jobs in the UK)  The UK government is classifying thousands of people with incurable degenerative diseases as "likely to be able to work again soon".  Even if some Britons only pretend to be disabled, why bother to "catch" them? There aren't enough jobs in the UK for all the people who are looking for work. There aren't enough jobs in the UK to start pushing wages up.  26 October 2014 (EU's new CO2 emissions target)  The EU's new target for reduced CO2 emissions is considered a weak target by environmentalists.  26 October 2014 (Urgent: Stop lobbying against solar power)  Everyone: tell the owners of Walmart to stop lobbying against installation of home solar power.  I think this is one additional reason not to buy from Walmart. I never get anything there.  26 October 2014 (Massive protests continue in Mexico)  Mexico is still having massive protests about the disappearance of 43 protesting students.  26 October 2014 (Political control of South Florida)  Parts of South Florida want to split off from Florida and form a new state to get rid of the political control of global heating deniers. One more foot of sea level rise will destroy the water supply and sewage systems of South Florida.  25 October 2014 (Armed drones used for policing)  Armed drones used for policing could threaten human rights.  I agree, but there is one countervailing factor. Soldiers and thugs can use rubber-coated steel bullets and tear-gas canisters to kill by intentionally shooting them at people's heads. A drone operated by a human through remote control would not enable such accurate shooting.  25 October 2014 ("Sex offenders" forced to be homeless)  In Miami-Dade County, hundreds of people labeled as "sex offenders" are forced to be homeless because every available living space is covered by the areas where they are forbidden to live.  The US is extremely energetic about labeling people as "sex offenders" which means they are punished in many ways for the rest of their lives.  25 October 2014 (US atrocities in Viet Nam)  The US government has a PR campaign to cover up the atrocities in Viet Nam and make that unjust war appear glorious. It wants to bury the fact that atrocities by US forces were commonplace.  "You can't separate this effort to justify the terrible wars of 50 years ago from the terrible wars of today."  25 October 2014 (Manipulation of stock prices)  US corporations manipulate their stock prices by buying back shares. Some companies borrow money to do this, which over time puts the company in greater debt. Others are sitting on piles of uninvested cash and can do this without borrowing.  25 October 2014 (Murder confessions in Thailand)  The Burmese migrants that confessed to a murder in Thailand say that the thugs threatened to kill them and dump them if they didn't confess.  25 October 2014 (Rana Plaza factory collapse)  The survivors and relatives of the workers killed in the collapse of the Rana Plaza factories have only begun to get compensation.  What is really needed is an end to the business-controlled globalization that lets multinational companies make states such as Bangladesh compete to allow the worst exploitation of workers. Let's replace it with a new form of worker-focused globalization, in which countries legislate that "If you sell goods here, the factories that make them must pay and treat workers according to our standards, no matter where they are working."  25 October 2014 (The Love Commandos)  The Love Commandos in India protect couples who run away from families that want to force them to marry others.  25 October 2014 (UK wildlife habitat protection)  On land and now on sea, the organizations responsible for protecting wildlife habitat in the UK have become friendly with the industries that destroy it.  25 October 2014 (Japanese gov't corruption scandals)  Several corruption scandals have hit the Japanese government.  25 October 2014 (Russian media censorship)  Russian journalists must now operate from Latvia due to Russian media censorship.  Will we see Australian journalists operating from Indonesia due to Australian media censorship?  25 October 2014 (Censorship of US prisoners)  Pennsylvania has passed a law allowing arbitrary censorship of public statements by prisoners and even former prisoners.  The US government led the way for this with its censorship of testimony about prisoners in Guantanamo about how they were tortured.  24 October 2014 (Urgent: Nuclear Negotiations)  US citizens: call on prominent Democrats to support nuclear  negotiations with Iran.   24 October 2014 (Misogyny)  The internet is crawling with misogyny, and any woman doing something controversial is likely to be attacked by  posted threats of violence. The examples cited in this article seem sick and twisted to me, but the worst thing I find in it is the assumption that women who are raped, or even seen semi-nude, have something to be ashamed of. That's the explicit assumption of the Indian rapists that make videos of the act, as well as their victim who was interviewed. She expects people to condemn and shun her if they know she was raped. People who do that are committing the most basic injustice. We can see this attitude in the firing, by an elite Canadian high school, of a drama teacher because who made  porn films in 1970. (She is now 73 years old.) What, the administrators ask, will today's high school students think from knowing their teacher made porn 45 years ago? Perhaps "Older generations were just like us"? Or perhaps, "Our administration wants women to be weak and susceptible to misogyny"?   24 October 2014 (Herbicide) Earthjustice and farmers have sued to block  use of 2,4-D herbicide (best known as part of the toxic Agent Orange that the US dropped on Vietnam).   24 October 2014 (Energy)  The EU has adopted the target of cutting greenhouse  gas emissions by 40% by 2030.  It is an ambitious target, but it lacks firm measures to achieve the goal. Meanwhile, Australia plans a new policy for boosting fossil fuel  investment and holding back growth of renewable energy.    24 October 2014 (Wisconsin)  The Republican candidate for attorney general of Wisconsin wants criminal  investigation laws changed to give politicians special privilege.   24 October 2014 (Obama) Is Obama Stalling Until Republicans Can Bury the CIA Torture Report?  24 October 2014 (BBC)  The BBC presented a documentary accusing the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front of broad war crimes.  In response, it proposes to ban the BBC in Rwanda.  That seems like a plea of guilty.  24 October 2014 (Fossil Fuel)  Fossil fuel interests have spent 7 million dollars to defeat a  referendum to ban fracking in Santa Barbara County.   24 October 2014 (Selling Data)  Schools and hospitals in the US are selling data about the students and patients  they are supposed to serve.  24 October 2014 (Online Avatars) Civil liberties advocate opposes use of online avatars  to catch sex offenders.  There are two issues here. First, the question of whether a person should face prosecution for a fictitious crime against a fictitious person. Second, supposing the answer is yes, there is the issue of entrapment, luring the person to commit the fictitious crime.  24 October 2014 (UK's Economy) The UK's economy has experienced a structural change of low pay for workers, starting  in 2003, and apparently permanent. Now that the UK has more or less exempted the rich and multinational companies from tax, the tax burden falls mainly on workers. Thus, the low pay wipes out tax revenue. The rich and businesses must be put into the tax base.  24 October 2014 (Investigation) Elizabeth Warren Demands An Investigation  Of Mortgage Companies.  24 October 2014 (Chicago Police Department) Amid Shootings, Chicago Police Department  Upholds Culture of Impunity.  Some killer thugs even get awards.  24 October 2014 (Gough Whitlam) Gough Whitlam, Australia's great social reformer, was removed from office by a CIA scheme.  A CIA agent admits it.  24 October 2014 (Track)  A company installed "beacons" to track passersby's phones  in four US cities.  24 October 2014 (El Salvador) El Salvador s Fight Against Gold Mine Will  Be Decided in D.C.  These treaties do not deserve to be obeyed, only torn up. That's what the Salvadoran government should do.  24 October 2014 (Driver) FTDI's proprietary driver for its USB-to-serial chips  sabotages alternative replacement chips when it finds them.   The driver can be used for sabotage because it is nonfree software. There is nothing whatsoever wrong with making other compatible chips, and it is wrong to call them "counterfeit" unless they are sold dishonestly.  23 October 2014 (Workers' rights undermined)  The euro-zone countries are reacting to a repeat recession by undermining workers' rights yet again.  23 October 2014 (Giving food to homeless people)  More US cities are making it a crime to give food to homeless people.  The right-wing idea is that homeless people are homeless because they are lazy; they were punished enough, they would find jobs. Of course, other right-wing policies have made sure there are no jobs for them and that jobs don't pay enough to rent a place to live.  23 October 2014 (Attacks on Canada)  Canada has seen two attacks by isolated Islamists against soldiers in Canada.  Several responses that Canada will be tempted to make, but must not make:  Send ground troops to fight in Iraq. (Just the thing to strengthen PISSI's support among Iraqi Sunnis.)  Crush civil liberties at home. Canada has already taken such a step with secret courts, which is one step too much.  Impose total surveillance so spy agencies will know everything about everyone.  23 October 2014 (ISPs that don't rat on customers)  An ISP in Australia is resisting copyright industry demands to rat on their customers.  One in the US is doing this too.  23 October 2014 (Great Barrier Reef)  Dredging the Great Barrier Reef for coal exports will endanger development of fish larvae.  23 October 2014 (UCL's "sustainability institute")  University College London has set up a "sustainability institute" funded by a giant mining company.  It must be difficult for people at that institute to be honest about the damage caused by mining.  23 October 2014 (TVs to monitor users)  TVs will be designed to monitor their users.  This article uses the perverse concept of "consuming" video. That word enables the writer to demonstrate his sophistication in disregarding all aspects of a situation except the economics, and getting even that wrong.  23 October 2014 (French Pun)  New pun in French.  23 October 2014 (Urgent: Stop pro-fracking ads on NPR)  In the US: tell NPR to stop running pro-fracking ads.  23 October 2014 (Urgent: Regulation of refinery pollution)  US citizens: call on the EPA to regulate toxic pollution from oil refineries.  23 October 2014 (Urgent: Have Congress vote on war)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and say, have Congress vote on whether the US should fight PISSI.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  23 October 2014 (Occupation of Palestine)  The permanent occupation of Palestine is accompanied by a permanent rejection of the idea that Palestinians under Israeli rule have human rights.  23 October 2014 (Bush's chief of "environmental quality")  Bush's appointed a paid global heating denialist as his chief of "environmental quality", whereupon he imposed changes on government scientific reports to minimize the danger.  Are you a young person? That official was putting your life in danger.  23 October 2014 (US spy agency personnel)  US spy agency personnel can get away with perjury, destruction of evidence, torture, kidnaping and assassination. The only unforgivable crime is telling the people how they are spitting on our rights.  Laura Poitras talks about her experience working with Edward Snowden.  23 October 2014 (Blackwater guards convicted)  Blackwater security guards were convicted of manslaughter.  However, the higher-ups who put them in a position to kill Iraqis are not being prosecuted.  23 October 2014 (Geneva homeless shelters)  In Geneva, old fallout shelters are now in use as homeless shelters.  23 October 2014 (Vietnamese blogger exiled)  An imprisoned Vietnamese blogger was removed from jail and put straight on a plane to exile in the US.  Ironically, it seems the statements that he was jailed for were a nationalistic criticism of China, not a campaign for freedom.  23 October 2014 ("Terrorism")  Note to Canada: it is not "terrorism" to kill soldiers of a country at war.  One can argue it is treason for a Canadian to thus take sides against his own country.  The ethics of this are a complicated question. Was Mr Rouleau fighting on behalf of Iraqis devastated by Bush's conquest and occupation of Iraq (done with Canada's help), or was he fighting on behalf of the PISSI which is more cruel than Bush ever dreamed of being?  23 October 2014 (Facebook claims loss in UK)  Facebook juggles its books to claim that it has "lost money" in the UK.  Make Facebook lose money for real! Don't be a used of Facebook!  23 October 2014 (Large dam project in India)  India is railroading a large dam project through slipshod environmental review.  23 October 2014 (Drug-resistant TB)  Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Poses Global Threat, Warn Doctors.  23 October 2014 (Australia's treatment of asylum seekers)  An Australian MP asked the ICC to investigate Australia's treatment of asylum seekers.  23 October 2014 (Phthalates)  Just about everyone is exposed to phthalates that seep out of plastics, and they have various harmful effects on people.  23 October 2014 (Rising sea levels in Venice)  Rising sea levels due to global heating are affecting gondolas in Venice: they have trouble getting under the old bridges.  By and by, Venice will have to be dammed off from the Adriatic Sea, and water pumped out of the lagoon all the time.  23 October 2014 (Afghanistan's poppy production)  Afghanistan's poppy production has hit a record level. Since the government tries to destroy poppies, they are grown mainly in areas controlled by the Taliban.  23 October 2014 (UK fracking investigators)  The UK will have the "risks and benefits" of fracking investigated by a team funded by frackers.  The team says it will be "impartial", the way Faux News is "fair and balanced".  23 October 2014 (Canadian indigenous people's land)  Canadian indigenous people are using their traditional land title to protect the environment, so the Canadian government is trying to force them to sell nearly all their land for a pittance.  23 October 2014 (Euphemisms that dehumanize)  "Cleansing the Stock" And Other Ways Governments Talk About Human Beings.  23 October 2014 (Books banned by US schools)  Right-wing US school boards are banning books about poverty and social classes.  23 October 2014 (CVS to penalize competitors)  The drugstore chain CVS owns a company that reimburses drug stores from insurance companies.  The idea of penalizing people for using drug stores that cell cigarettes might be good, but one drug store should not be able to decide on such policies towards its competitors.  22 October 2014 (Urgent: Impeach Judge Fuller)  US citizens: call on Congress to impeach Judge Fuller, who pled guilty to attacking his wife.  22 October 2014 (Future of journalism in the US?)  The future of journalism in the US: will "official sources" be the only sources?  22 October 2014 (Inverted totalitarianism)  How to rebel against "inverted totalitarianism"?  22 October 2014 (US "security" policy)  A scholar argues that US "security" policy is decided by an entrenched bureaucracy, not by elected officials.  This may be true in practice, but a president opposed to massive surveillance could stop it.  22 October 2014 (Cluster bombs dropped on Donetsk)  It appears Ukraine dropped cluster bombs on Donetsk.  22 October 2014 (Nigeria's vigorous response to Ebola)  How Nigeria's vigorous response quashed Ebola in that country.  22 October 2014 (Putting dissidents in mental hospitals)  Putin has reestablished the Soviet practice of declaring dissidents mentally incompetent and imprisoning them in mental hospitals.  22 October 2014 (Solving Urban Homelessness)  Housing First: the 'Counterintuitive' Method for Solving Urban Homelessness.  22 October 2014 (Occupy Parliament Square in London)  Democracy protesters have occupied Parliament Square in London for several days. Recently they were attacked by thugs using a law designed pre-emptively to criminalize protest camps.  21 October 2014 (The repressed Christian US South)  Google search statistics suggest that porn is especially popular in the repressed Christian south of the US.  21 October 2014 (Large centralized power plants)  Large centralized power plants carry large unreliability.  21 October 2014 (Microsoft's "immutable laws of security")  Microsoft's "immutable laws of security" ironically imply (law 1 and 2) that if Windows is on your computer, it's not secure.  21 October 2014 (Imprisonment for tearing up a photo)  Zainab Al-Khawaja faces 7 years' imprisonment in Bahrain for tearing up a photo of the king.  Freedom of speech includes the freedom to insult any person, any group, any organization, and any idea.  Bahrain used Saudi troops to crush protests, with total US backing.  21 October 2014 (Gamergate)  Gamergate explained.  Here's what I think of this.   The principal wrong in this issue consists of the threats of rape and murder made against some commentators. These threats are inexcusable. Even supposing the targets' statements were mistaken or dishonest, that would not justify these threats.  The integrity of journalism is a significant issue, in regard to computer games as in every other area. However, according to this article, the initial accusation that a game designer exercised dishonest influence on a journalist is demonstrably false.  Meanwhile, US journalism is subject to distorting influence in regard to issues such as war, destabilization campaigns, supporting tyrannical allies, global heating, "free trade" treaties, massive surveillance, and others.  The quality of journalism is also a significant issue. Journalism about computer games is generally lousy because it focuses solely on what playing the game is like, and disregards the grave ethical flaw nearly all these games have: a nonfree software engine.   If you value your freedom, rather than arguing about whether a review of a nonfree game was accurate in regard to secondary aspects, refuse to run nonfree games.  21 October 2014 (Illegal Copying)  Illegal Copying Has Always Created Jobs, Growth, And Prosperity.  21 October 2014 (Punishing prison guards that are whistleblowers)  The UK government is punishing prison guards that are whistleblowers.  21 October 2014 (Citizen's right to vote)  The US needs a constitutional amendment to establish every citizen's right to vote.  21 October 2014 (Long-Acting birth control)  There's finally an effective way to end teen pregnancy: long-acting birth control.  21 October 2014 (Hatred against disabled)  The UK government's real attitude towards the disabled is now patent: to stir up hatred against them while pushing them into hopeless poverty.  People who hate the disabled will forget to hate the plutocrats that really deserve it.  A worldwide survey of happiness finds that people are generally happier in societies with "big government" that runs ample welfare programs.  20 October 2014 (UK gov't want to collect data without warrant)  The UK government wants to be able to collect data from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube automatically (without a warrant, of course).  20 October 2014 (The TPP)  The US wants to use the TPP to impose criminal penalties on access to trade secrets through a computer, with no protection even for journalists investigating dangerous or unjust practices.  This calls to mind the "Ag-Gag" bills designed to criminalize undercover investigations of shameful or illegal farm practices.  20 October 2014 (Finnish parliament won't consider petitions)  Finland has a system for the public to propose revised laws by petition; then the parliament is supposed to vote on these changes. A petition for small relaxation in harsh copyright law was rejected by a committee as too radical.  So far, parliament has rejected all six of the petitions without voting on any of them.  20 October 2014 (Senate's report on CIA torture)  The Senate's still unpublished report on CIA torture intentionally disregards the role of higher officials in the Bush regime.  20 October 2014 (Neonicotinoid pesticide)  A study found that a neonicotinoid pesticide, used on soy beans, provides little or no benefit in production.  Farmers may still want to use it, if it gives a little benefit, but we should not allow them to do so.  20 October 2014 (Tracking of people's movements)  A Florida court ruled that tracking a person's movements in real time through cell phone data requires a warrant.  This is a good decision, but I still don't feel like carrying a cell phone and giving that data to anyone.  20 October 2014 (Chevron trying to buy elections)  Will Chevron succeed in buying municipal elections in Richmond, California?  20 October 2014 (French senate votes for censorship)  The French senate voted for the Loi Cazeneuve, which imposes dangerous censorship.  20 October 2014 (Pressure to divest from fossil fuels)  Environment defenders are moving their money out of Australia's big banks to pressure them to divest from fossil fuels. They claim $250 million has already been moved for this reason.  This goes with warnings that fossil fuel reserves are a bubble that has to burst.  20 October 2014 (Death sentences for blasphemy)  Pakistan continues sentencing people to death for blasphemy, after trials that would be unjust even for a real crime.  Changing the trials and the penalties would make the blasphemy law do less damage, but would not make it just. Freedom of speech includes the freedom to offend or insult any person, real or imaginary. Criminalizing blasphemy was wrong in Britain, just as it is wrong in Pakistan today.  The unfair trials are a second injustice, and the murder of politicians is a third. What all three have in common is that they are perpetrated by religious fanatics who believe they are entitled to use force against those who would criticize them.  20 October 2014 (HK protests)  The Hong Kong protest has grown to around 10,000 again, and thugs had to give up on attacking the protesters.  20 October 2014 (Mexico's disappeared students)  Protesters in Mexico continue to demand return of the 43 disappeared students, and also take actions to denounce and apologize for other protesters' violence.  All those mass graves, whether they contain these students or not, are testimony to the violence that Mexico has experienced from the "war on drugs". When a war is on drugs, its violence affects everyone indiscriminately.  20 October 2014 (CIA report on arming foreign rebels)  An internal report of the CIA found that arming rebels in other countries has almost never been effective.  In many cases it was a good thing that this failed, since the US was attacking governments with local support, for reasons of commercial interest.  20 October 2014 (Haiti's former dictator dead)  Although Haiti's former dictator "Baby Doc" is dead, his repression continues under President Martelly. Martelly is also fabricating charges against Aristide.  The US intervened shamelessly to make Martelly "president".  20 October 2014 (Detroit water rates)  Detroit's bankruptcy-imposed government continues trying to make people with no income pay high rates for water.  20 October 2014 (Renewable electric generation)  Germany and Nordic countries are developing so much renewable electric generation capacity that they can retire some fossil fuel plants.  20 October 2014 (Khomeini said no to WMDs)  Ayatollah Khomeini decided that Iran cannot make weapons of mass destruction.  20 October 2014 (James Risen's new book)  A review of Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War, by James Risen.  20 October 2014 (Kurdish reinforcements) The US dropped weapons and supplies  to Kurds in Kobani. and appears to have convinced Turkey to let Kurdish  reinforcements in.   20 October 2014 ("Cost savings" costing society)  "Cost savings" obtained by screwing the poor and sick often cost society dearly. For instance, the UK could save 8 billion pounds a year by spending a mere 1/3 billion  on mental health care for mothers. Reducing spending or deficits is only an excuse. When right-wingers succeed in doing this, they turn around and cut taxes for the wealthy or businesses, thus creating another deficit that they "need" to reduce by screwing the poor and sick.   20 October 2014 (Secret trial in UK) An accused terrorist in the UK is being tried  partly in secret. A secret trial is an unjust trial, but we have already seen enough to condemn one the charges, that of "possessing a document". For there to be any work that it is forbidden to have a copy of is incompatible with human rights.  20 October 2014 (Canada punishes NGOs with audits)  The Canadian government is punishing NGOs with audits for writing to the government about issues,  which is supposed to be legal for them.  20 October 2014 (Deceptive business practices)   Deceptive practice has become standard practice for many businesses.  20 October 2014 (Democratic school)  A democratic primary/secondary  school in the US.  20 October 2014 (Urgent: No palm oil from deforestation)  Everyone: Tell McDonalds to adopt a policy to make sure its palm oil does  not cause deforestation.  20 October 2014 (Republicans)  Republicans insanely condemn Obama's rational response to the  danger of Ebola virus. What they demand to avoid at all costs is what will make the US safer from Ebola and other future epidemics: supporting proper public health systems in poor countries.   20 October 2014 (Privatization in Africa)  Western-imposed privatization and spending cuts in Africa produced weak health care systems that can't cope with  epidemics such as Ebola.  20 October 2014 (PISSI)  PISSI enslaves captured women. Some have escaped, and then a strange thing happens: they feel ashamed, rather than proud  of their strength and courage.  I think this reflects twisted patriarchal gender attitudes, the same ones that provide the soil for PISSI to grow in. If you want to watch the video from youtube, don't watch it embedded &mdash; that uses nonfree software. Instead, fetch it with youtube-dl. PISSI captures and  kills Iraqi journalists too.  20 October 2014 (Automation)  Automation is the central factor behind a 10% fall in wages for British workers without unusual marketable skills,  and it is going to get worse. More or less the same is happening in the US. The solution is obvious: tax the rich to spread the benefits that automation provides.  20 October 2014 (Indigenous Peoples' Day)  Seattle celebrated Indigenous Peoples' Day, rather than celebrating the  man who started killing and enslaving them.  If you want to listen to the audio, for please use one of the alternative formats that work without enabling Javascript code.  20 October 2014 (Coal Companies)  Coal companies used the G20 meeting to lobby for more coal mining, presenting coal  as the savior of the world. It's ridiculous, of course, but officials often support ridiculous claims to get funds for their election campaigns, or work in retirement.  20 October 2014 (Facebook)  Facebook is still suspending the accounts of drag queens  that don't reveal their official names.  However, Facebook is trying to convince them to stay, so it can do drag net surveillance.  20 October 2014 (UK proposes privatized prison for teenagers)  The UK is cutting the budget for education for teenagers in prison, but it proposes to build a privatized prison for teenagers as an  excuse to legalize using force against them.  20 October 2014 (Edzard Ernst) Edzard Ernst, hero of  scientific medicine.  20 October 2014 (Amazon deforestation doubles)  The rate of deforestation in the Amazon rain forest  has doubled since a year ago.  20 October 2014 (Beware the BitLicense)  Beware the  BitLicense.  20 October 2014 (Erdogan refuses to help defend Kurds)  Erdogan says Turkey will not help the  US defend Kurds. This formalizes what was already apparent. So much for Obama's dream coalition. However, the US can bring food, arms and Kurdish fighters to Kobani by air without Turkey's help.  20 October 2014 (Pharmaceuticals and wildlife destruction)  Human pharmaceuticals could be to blame for part of the massive destruction of wildlife now occurring.  20 October 2014 (Repeated attacks on HK protesters)  Thugs have repeatedly attacked the massed protesters in Hong Kong. The protesters resist the sticks and pepper spray  without attacking.  20 October 2014 (Christian doctrine of hell)  Has the Christian Doctrine of Hell Become an  Awkward Liability?  20 October 2014 (Right-to-die activist fasts to death)  Jean Davis, 86 years old, fasted to death because her children were forbidden to help her  get a less difficult death.  20 October 2014 (Transport of Kurdish peshmerga)  Is it possible for the US to bring Kurdish peshmerga from Iraq to Kobani by helicopter? That might save the Kurds of Kobani.  Is it possible for the US to airdrop food and ammunition to them? Even if half of it fell into the hands of the jihadis, that half would make no material difference (they already have plenty of both), and the other half might save the Kurds of Kobani.  20 October 2014 (Being Homeless in USA)  Ten Facts about Being Homeless in USA.  Basically, governments don't help the homeless as much and persecute them more.  20 October 2014 (Increase in suicides in UK prisons)  Inadequate staffing is causing an increase in suicides in UK prisons.  In some cases, the suicide seems to be a reaction to mistreatment. How can it make sense to put a suicidal person, not accused of doing anything wrong to others, in prison "for his safety"? Even a well-staffed prison is not a safe or secure place.  20 October 2014 (Children enslaved in Italy)  4000 African children who got into Italy appear to have been kidnaped and enslaved.  20 October 2014 (Divestment from fossil fuel companies)  The aim of divestment from fossil fuel companies is to show that these investments are odious, and force them to pay for all the future damage they have caused.  20 October 2014 (Global heating effects nonuniform)  The effects of global heating are nonuniform. The average October temperature in Pt Barrow has risen 7C (12F) since 34 years ago.  20 October 2014 (NY Times definition of "democracy")  The New York Times once again defines "democracy" in Latin America as "submitting to the USA".  20 October 2014 (Hong Kong protest)  Thugs repeatedly clear away protest areas in Hong Kong.  If the 400,000 who supported the protests were to keep protesting, the antidemocratic government might have to yield.  20 October 2014 (New Pun)  New pun: geometer.   20 October 2014 ("Stand your ground")  Right wing judges and officials don't want "stand your ground" laws to apply to women defending themselves from violent domestic partners.  Indeed, those laws are meant to allow white men (who dare carry guns in public) to kill black men (who know thugs would fabricate an excuse to beat them and arrest them if they carried guns in public). Helping women was never the intention.  20 October 2014 (Using war to stay in power)  Navalny, after a relaxation in the terms of his house arrest, accuses Putin of using war to stay in power.  20 October 2014 (Minimum-Wage pay is too little)  The people who clean the UK foreign ministry protested that their minimum-wage pay is too little to live in London and do the job.  The article demonstrates the harm done by subcontracting, which gives the state and other companies a way to hire people for low wages and say "we're not responsible, since we don't employ them."  A company or agency that gets workers through a subcontractor should be directly responsible for how they are treated and how much they are paid.  20 October 2014 (Man Sues Germany for Drone Killings of Civilians)  Yemeni Man Sues Germany for Role in US Drone Killings of Civilians.  20 October 2014 (Urgent: An end to trials of GMO wheat)  US citizens: call for an end to trials of GMO wheat.  19 October 2014 (NY thugs' driving records private)  Thugs in New York State say that they can collect information on everyone's driving because that's public; but when a reporter asked to see their records about him, they claimed it was secret.  19 October 2014 (Campaign reduces rhino horn demand)  An education campaign in Vietnam has cut the demand for rhino horn by 33%, by correcting the superstitious idea that it is beneficial.  Can anyone make plausible imitation rhino horn? It would work just as well as the real thing.  19 October 2014 (Finfisher)  Privacy International calls for prosecution of the British company that made the Finfisher intrusion/spying program, used by the cruel Bahraini regime to attack activists in England.  19 October 2014 (Morocco)  Ray Cole describes how in Morocco he was accused based on irrelevant evidence, jailed incommunicado, and bullied into signing a statement he could not read.  The prison guards also lied to the British consul, saying Cole did not want to see him.  It seems clear they treat Moroccans just as badly.  19 October 2014 (Massive biometrics capture)  Australia's government proposes massive biometrics capture, but may not succeed in imposing it.  19 October 2014 (Fracking)  If a lot of natural gas is obtained by fracking, it will squeeze out renewable energy and likely result in more greenhouse gas emissions.  19 October 2014 (Reducing the weak to desperation)  A Tory minister called for paying the disabled less than minimum wage, stating explicitly the right-wing goal of reducing the weak to desperation.  The same goal is at work in making prisoners work for companies that pay them a pittance. This reduces jobs and wages for people outside prison, and more of them will end up in prison, making a vicious cycle.  19 October 2014 (CO2 emissions-trading scheme)  Europe Needs to Fix Or Ditch Its Emissions-Trading Scheme.  A carbon tax would be better. One of the problems with the European emissions-trading scheme is that it is too easily gamed: companies can get credit for industries that have simply failed, for instance, and emissions credits are so cheap that nobody really needs to conserve.  19 October 2014 (Private "police foundations")  Private "police foundations" buy controversial massive surveillance equipment and donate it to thug departments across the US, bypassing democratic decisionmaking about what these systems should do.  19 October 2014 (Fish in offshore oil wells)  Offshore oil wells are great habitats for fish.  Burning oil generates CO2 which makes some fish dangerously uncautious and will kill (at a sufficient concentration) many shelled animals.  But we could plant suitable structures without using them to extract oil.  19 October 2014 (Depleted uranium use)  Iraqi Doctors Call Depleted Uranium Use "Genocide".  19 October 2014 (Call for thug accountability)  From Chicago to Geneva, a Call for Police Accountability for Violence and Torture.  19 October 2014 (Colombian farmers suing BP)  Colombian farmers are suing BP in Britain.  19 October 2014 (Farm pesticides and suicide)  Farm pesticides have been linked to an increase in depression and suicide.  19 October 2014 (Texas abortion providers)  The US Supreme Court allowed some Texas abortion providers to reopen &hellip; until the case is finally decided.  19 October 2014 (Massive surveillance)  The UN special rapporteur on counter-terrorism says that massive surveillance violates human rights as defined by the UN.  19 October 2014 (Thugs attack HK protesters)  Thugs attacked Hong Kong protesters and closed some of their barricades.  19 October 2014 (100 students in Egypt arrested)  100 students were arrested in Egypt this week for protesting.  Violent Islamist fanatics continue to fight the regime with terrorism, but all in all their violence is less than what the military regime directed at peaceful Islamist fanatic protesters.  19 October 2014 (43 disappeared students)  The mass graves found in Mexico appear not to contain the 43 disappeared students.  19 October 2014 (Gun threat against feminist)  A talk by feminist Anita Sarkesian was cancelled due to a mysogynist threat to shoot her, backed up by a state law that prohibited stopping people from bringing weapons into the auditorium.  That law says, in effect, that anyone people threaten to shoot cannot speak in public.  19 October 2014 (Private charities)  Private charities are nowhere near capable of giving America's tens of millions of poor people the help they need.  19 October 2014 (Why no banksters go to jail in the US)  Matt Taibbi explains why no banksters go to jail in the US, while so many blacks and welfare recipients do: because thugs systematically harass those groups seeking (and inventing) excuses to arrest them.  It's not policing, it's occupation.  19 October 2014 (Corruption charges in Turkey)  The corruption charges against high officials in Turkey have been dropped. Many of the officials involved in bringing the charges had faced official retribution.  Either the charges were bogus and placed for political reasons, as Erdogan says, or they were valid and he has protected his party colleagues' abuse of power. I have no way of determining which it was.  19 October 2014 (Coal ship leaving Australia blocked)  Pacific Islanders blocked a coal ship leaving Australia.  Combustion of fossil fuel is inundating their islands little by little. A few have already become uninhabitable.  19 October 2014 (Prosecuted for filming in West Papua)  French documentary makers are being prosecuted for filming in West Papua, where foreign journalists are not allowed.  Indonesia took over West Papua by force in the 1960s when the Dutch pulled out, and has sent large numbers of Javanese colonists. It's somewhat like China and Tibet.  19 October 2014 (Colleges reshaped by plutocracy and budget cutting)  State colleges in the US today have been reshaped by plutocracy and budget cutting, along with hiring patterns, so that students from poor backgrounds are likely to end up with debts and no good job.  There are some exceptions, of course. If you have talent in a professional field, and you study hard, you can still get a job. For a while.  19 October 2014 (China banned logging in state forests)  China has banned logging in state forests in its most heavily forested province.  In the US, businesses control politicians. In China, the politicians own and control the businesses, or else the state owns them. While Chinese politicians can be quite corrupt, they can also take action to protect China's future from rogue businesses, in a way that US politicians no longer can do.  19 October 2014 (How Whisper users can be identified)  How Whisper users can be identified based on the vague geolocation data Whisper keeps.  18 October 2014 (The power to encrypt people's data)  The FBI presented cases to prove that it needs the power to encrypt people's data. All of the cases were bogus.  18 October 2014 (Iraqi army)  Why the US-constructed Iraqi army couldn't and wouldn't fight PISSI.  Basically, the idea of setting up a client state and training its army to fight for it (i.e., for the US) doesn't work.  18 October 2014 (Cuts aimed at poor people)  US budget cuts aimed at poor people don't ultimately reduce spending. But they sure do help demonize the poor, which is what right-wing politicians need.  18 October 2014 (Urgent: End racism in Boston thug dept.)  Everyone: sign this petition calling on Boston to put an end to racism in its thug department.  18 October 2014 (Urgent: Solidarity with HK protesters)  Everyone: sign this petition of solidarity with Hong Kong democracy protesters.  18 October 2014 (How Microsoft shuts down companies)  Microsoft uses US courts to shut down companies by seizing their domain names so clients cannot contact them. The court cases go on without informing the targeted companies.  18 October 2014 (Australia's millenials)  In Australia, government policy makes millenials poor and the rest of society blames them for it. Many of them, not realizing the fault isn't theirs, are going crazy.  The first step in not going crazy is to realize that the injustice is imposed by the state. The second step is to unite to kick out plutocracy. If the rich were not getting richer, there would be enough for the aged and the young.  18 October 2014 (New TPP leak)  A new leak of the part of the draft Trans-Pacific Partnership shows that the US is pushing mass murder in the form of tightened patent power on medicines.  This treaty does harm already, although it is still a draft, simply by using the propaganda term "intellectual property" to lump together various unrelated laws.  To repeat that term is to boost the confusion &mdash; and we don't have to repeat it. Since I identified the term as a confusion-spreader, ten years ago, I have not used it once.  I will say that the TPP negotiators put the bogus label "intellectual property" on this chapter but I will not use the term myself.  18 October 2014 (Minimum wage of the 1960s)  Raising the minimum wage to match what it was in the 1960s would save 1.7 million Americans from needing public assistance.  18 October 2014 (Fighting PISSI)  Seven potential disasters that could result from fighting PISSI.  It appears to me that we must accept sectarian partition of Iraq. It has, de facto, already happened, and accepting it is the only way to convince Iraqi Sunnis they can protect themselves without PISSI.  PISSI is the Pseudo-Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.  18 October 2014 (UK NHS staff shortages)  The UK NHS is so underfunded that its staff shortages endanger patients.  The reason the NHS is underfunded is plutocratic refusal to tax businesses and the rich; they demand to be subsidized instead.  18 October 2014 (Student protesters in Egypt)  Egypt's US-Backed Military Regime is Brutalizing Student Protestors.  18 October 2014 (TPP)  The latest TPP draft proposes to make coffeehouses liable when their patrons use the internet for sharing.  18 October 2014 (GCHQ and NSA)  Annie Machon: GCHQ prostituting itself to the NSA over the last few years.  18 October 2014 (People's voiceprints)  ACLU: the dangers posed by collecting millions of people's voiceprints.  18 October 2014 (Whisper records user locations)  Whisper, which promises its users anonymity, records their location at each post. The pattern of a single user's movements can more or less identify who that user is.  More dirt on whisper.  18 October 2014 (All MPs of Golden Dawn face charges)  All the MPs of the Golden Dawn party face charges of murder and other acts of violence.  This worries me. The party is neo-Nazi, and some of its members commit violence, but are all of them directly implicated in the violence &mdash; or are they going to be tried for their political views?  This resembles the way Israel arrested hundreds of Hamas supporters and even MPs using a real crime as a pretext.  18 October 2014 (Pushing people into self-employment)  The crass remarks of a Tory minister reveal an already-existing abuse, where people are pushed into self-employment so as to pay them less than a minimum wage.  18 October 2014 (Thugs raid journalist's house)  New Zealand journalist Nicky Hager revealed evidence of the ruling party's dirty political tricks; then thugs raided his house and seized his computers.  Evidently the politicians that control New Zealand prefer to keep crime secret rather than behave honestly.  17 October 2014 (Death sentence for dissent)  Saudi Arabia sentenced a Shi'ite religious leader to death, for "crimes" amounting to dissent.  17 October 2014 (Rape threats against TV personality)  A TV personality has received rape threats after speaking in favor of allowing a convict to resume his previous job after release from prison for rape. Her daughter received rape threats too.  You may agree or disagree with her statement, but threats are not justified as a response.  The US imposes so many kinds of exclusions on ex-cons that, unless they are geniuses, they are almost condemned to a life of crime. This is not in society's interest; it results from politicians' desire to look tough. I don't know whether it is the same in the UK.  It seems to me that people who object to giving this particular ex-con this particular job back view sports stars as symbols of an ideal person. A rapist is a bad choice for an ideal person, but then, I don't consider professional sports as the site to find ideal persons in. I think it is just a well-paid job.  17 October 2014 (Privatization of state services)  US state governors are privatizing state services for profit. In some cases, their own profit.  It is not just states. Chicago privatized parking meters and was greatly shafted.  17 October 2014 (Persecution of reporters' sources)  Obama's persecution of reporters' sources, and how it dwarfs previous US history.  16 October 2014 (Urgent: Cancel oil exploration)  US citizens: Call on Obama to cancel oil exploration on the Atlantic coast, which will make loud sounds that injure whales and dolphins.  I put this as my message.  To avoid global heating disaster, we need to leave 80% of fossil fuel reserves in the ground. Finding more reserves is at best a waste, and when it injures whales, it is worse than a waste.   16 October 2014 (Rates of amputations for US diabetics)  US diabetics are three times as likely to get a leg amputated if they are black, than if they are white.  It is not clear why, but it has to be due to prejudice one way or another.  16 October 2014 (Two nurses catch Ebola in Dallas)  Nurses accuse Dallas hospital of having inadequate equipment to protect them from Ebola, and lousy procedures too. Two of them have caught an Ebola infection.  16 October 2014 (UK fracking)  The UK plans to allow fracking companies to put "any substance" under people's homes, without informing them.  16 October 2014 (Harassment)  Even being wealthy graduates of prestigious schools doesn't enable US blacks to protect their children from racist insults.  What makes the most impression on me is how far blacks in the US have to bend over backwards to avoid being falsely accused or treated with prejudice. These precautions seem to have been mostly effective &mdash; being called a nasty name is not that bad on the scale of human injustice &mdash; but it's unfair for anyone to have to do that.  Meanwhile, think of all the people (black or not) who aren't in the families of wealthy graduates of prestigious schools. They don't deserve to be harassed either.  16 October 2014 (Japan's "national tradition")  Whaling interests in Japan paid a PR company in the 1970s to fabricate a "national tradition" of eating whale meat.  16 October 2014 (Making it hard for minors to get abortions)  For minors in the US, getting a judge's permission for an abortion is painful harassment, often followed by arbitrary denial.  Just getting out of school to go to a court in another town may be a struggle.  I don't understand how people who generally agree it is not a good thing for poor minors to have children come to support laws making it hard for them to avoid doing so.  16 October 2014 (A repeating tendency of SWAT raids)  A SWAT team shot and killed a homeowner who tried to protect himself from a repeat burglary. He didn't know that the burglar claimed to have stolen drugs from him.  I don't see anything saying where this took place, except that it is in the US. Can anyone tell me?  Thieves do steal drugs and drug equipment. Perhaps it was reasonable to investigate the accusation against Hooks. The central problem is the repeating tendency of SWAT raids to kill innocent people.  16 October 2014 (NYC thug violence)  New York City thugs keep on bashing and injuring unarmed people who are not even suspected of doing anything seriously wrong.  If you want to watch the YouTube video, please download it using youtube-dl. If you view it from the site directly, that requires either Flash or nonfree Javascript code.  Another New York City thug stole a thousand dollars from a man after harassing him because he objected to how the thug was treating his friend.  16 October 2014 (Sabotage of TLS security)  A US wireless ISP is reportedly sabotaging TLS security by acting as a man in the middle.  16 October 2014 (Public banks)  How a city can set up a public bank and make its funds secure against failure of the big bankster banks.  16 October 2014 (Israel destroys village's power grid)  Israel destroyed the power grid of a Palestinian village that Israel threatens to demolish entirely.  16 October 2014 (Imprisoned Palestinian Parliament members)  Israel continues to keep 33 members of the Palestinian Parliament in prison, mostly without charges.  The kidnaping and murder of three teenagers is used as the pretext for this, although these elected officials had nothing to do with it.  Imagine if Palestinians could put Israeli right-wing politicians in prison because Israeli fanatics murdered a Palestinian teenager.  16 October 2014 (The PKK)  One Administration's Terrorist Is Another's Freedom Fighter. Just Ask the PKK.  15 October 2014 (Urgent: Curb methane leaks)  US citizens: call on Obama to take action quickly to curb methane leaks from oil and gas extraction.  It appears this needs to be done for coal mining too.  15 October 2014 (Putin to shut down human rights organization)  Russia's principal human rights organization since Soviet times, founded by Andrei Sakharov, is going to be shut down by Putin.  15 October 2014 ("Sports drinks")  "Sports drinks" are mostly used outside of the context of sports, and are bad for people's health.  15 October 2014 (Isolation of young and old)  Modern western society isolates the young and the old, leaving them with no idea of anything to want except wealth.  The statistics cited are from the UK, but I expect it is true in the US as well.  When hippies wished to live in communes, it had to be a rejection of the beginnings of this. The communes failed because just wishing isn't enough to make a new social system succeed.  The loneliness of old people, many of whom had children, shows that having children is not a solution.  Being part of some other sort of community, such as a political activist community that defends people who are being exploited, can make your life a lot less lonely as well as helping others.  15 October 2014 (Ireland to close a tax loophole)  Ireland will close one of the tax loopholes that multinational corporations use to avoid paying tax on their income cross Europe.  However, Ireland's low corporation tax still constitutes beggar-thy-neighbor. The rest of Europe, if it were not corrupted by those same corporations, would make Ireland stop this.  15 October 2014 (Reclaiming Louisiana land lost to sea)  Louisiana plans a megaproject to reclaim some of the 2000 square miles lost to the sea in the last century.  In principle, it is a good idea, but it will be futile if we don't stop pumping out the greenhouse gases that melt icecaps and raise sea level even more.  15 October 2014 (Bolivia reelects Morales)  President Morales of Bolivia was reelected after his socialist policies reduced poverty and grew the economy.  You can cause economic growth with right-wing policies too, as the US and UK have demonstrated, but doing it that way increases poverty.  15 October 2014 (Kurds in Turkey fighting the state)  Fighting has flared up between Kurds in Turkey and the Turkish state.  This fighting seems to have been provoked by Turkey's policy of passively helping PISSI to capture Kobani.  15 October 2014 (UK to deport activist to Pakistan)  The UK plans to deport Liaquat Ali Hazara to Pakistan where he faces death threats from religious fanatics.  15 October 2014 (North Korea keeping people hungry)  North Korea is keeping its people hungry to export rice to wealthier China.  15 October 2014 (Wisconsin's voter ID law)  Various Republican forms of political sabotage worked together to support Wisconsin's voter ID law, leading to a split between modern "hold power no matter how" Republicans and older Republicans who have some loyalty to the ideals of a free political system.  15 October 2014 ("Moral Monday" protests)  Weekly "Moral Monday" protests have begun in Ferguson and in nearby St Louis.  15 October 2014 (Privately hired thugs)  The practice of privately hiring thugs with the legal power to arrest, or to look the other way, endangers the rights of those who aren't paying.  15 October 2014 (New Facebook Pun)  New pun, Facebook's policies.  15 October 2014 (On Doxing)  On doxing, and how to spell it.  14 October 2014 (Urgent: Drop forced arbitration clauses)  In the US: call on banks to drop their forced arbitration clauses.  14 October 2014 (Urgent: Demilitarize US thugs)  US citizens: sign this petition to demilitarize and reform US thugs.  14 October 2014 (UK MPs vote to recognize Palestine)  UK MPs voted to recognize Palestine. Unfortunately it was a non-binding vote.  14 October 2014 (UK university education cost)  The UK has adopted the US model for university education, requiring students to take out huge loans. Nonetheless, many are desperate to go to a university because wages for non-graduates have been knocked down. Indeed, many graduates won't get good jobs because there are too many.  The only aspect which is not quite as bad as the US is that graduates with low incomes won't have to pay as much.  14 October 2014 (UK values submarines above children)  Next year, most children in the UK will be living in poverty. The UK hasn't got the billions needed to help them, because nuclear missile submarines have higher priority.  14 October 2014 (New antiplutocratic parties)  New antiplutocratic parties have had success in several European countries.  14 October 2014 (Sea level rise)  The sea level rise of the past century is a record for 6000 years. (That is when the melting of the ice age ice sheets finished.)  Even if we stop pumping out greenhouse gas, the Earth will continue getting hotter for quite some time due to the greenhouse gas we have already pumped out. That's ignoring the possibility that positive feedback effects will release more. And it will take centuries for the effect of that heat to finish melting all the ice it is going to melt.  We will have to lower the greenhouse gas level substantially below the present level to get the ice to stop melting.  14 October 2014 (Persecution of Koreans in Japan)  In Japan, right-wing extremists with support of officials in the ruling party call for persecution of Korean residents, and have launched a campaign of threats against journalists that cover Japan's war crimes.  The Korean residents of Japan are descendants of Koreans forcibly taken to work in Japan when Korea was under Japanese rule. Those alive today were born in Japan, but in Japan that does not give them citizenship.  Naturalization in Japan is not like naturalization in the US; it requires denying one's previous identity and trying to act totally Japanese. These people of Korean descent might be willing to get Japanese citizenship, but they don't want to deny their identity.  14 October 2014 (Computerized recognition of voices)  Computerized recognition of people's voices is being employed on a large scale.  I don't mind if bank customers can use this authenticate themselves to the bank. What worries me is that it can also be used to track people.  14 October 2014 (Wind power in Europe)  Taking account of externalities, wind power is the cheapest form of generation in Europe.  Coal costs more than double.  14 October 2014 (Safer, more accessible abortions)  Remotely supervised use of prescribed abortion pills can make abortions safer and more accessible.  14 October 2014 (Sexual harassment female students face in UK)  The level of sexual harassment female students face in UK universities today is amazing.  I think it is largely the same in US universities, but I never saw anything like this when I was studying at Harvard in 1970-74.  I think the social pressure to get drunk is the worst part of it.  14 October 2014 (Pushing Europe into depression)  Germany's government is practicing economic harshness for harshness' sake, and pushing Europe into depression.  14 October 2014 (Girls expect to have no control over their lives)  A world-wide survey found that around half of all girls expect to have no control over their lives.  14 October 2014 (Reports on al Qa'ida's magazine)  Peter van Buren reviews reports on al Qa'ida's magazine.  In tyrannical states such as the UK, you could be imprisoned just for having a copy of the magazine.  14 October 2014 (Wearing my "Impeach God" button)  A week ago I made a connection in Dallas-Ft Worth Airport, and was wearing my "Impeach God" button. A pilot said it takes courage to wear such a button there. It did not seem to me that I was being particularly courageous.  However, a rather strange conversation ensued on the subsequent flight: a flight attendant said, "I feel offended by your button. Please take it off."  I responded, "I don't see why you should feel offended, unless &hellip; you're not a god, are you?"  She: "No, but I believe in god."  I: "Well, I don't."  She: "But you're putting your views all over me!"  I: "Actually, I'm putting them all over me. I can't make you wear such a button, and I wouldn't try."  At that point, she let the issue drop.  14 October 2014 (University divestment from fossil fuel)  The Australian National University decided to divest from some fossil fuel companies, which occasioned absurd rebukes from right-wing politicians that represent the fossil fuel companies.  There is no limit to how far they will go to increase fossil fuel sales.  14 October 2014 (The evil of the Koch brothers)  The evil of the Koch brothers includes racism, as well as voter-suppression, dooH niboR and frying Earth's ecosphere.  14 October 2014 (US allows cancelling 60% of pensions)  The US now allows bankrupt cities to cancel 60% of retired workers' pensions.  They can't live on what remains.  14 October 2014 (Pirate Party electoral success)  The Pirate Party had an electoral success in Czech local elections.  14 October 2014 (Generic equivalent drugs)  Around 10 million people with HIV owe their lives to generic equivalent drugs. The Obama regime is pressuring India to stop making them, which would kill millions of those people within a few years.  The Nazis murdered 7 million civilians. This could murder more than 7 million of those now in treatment, and more millions in the future. The US officials behind this are aiming to be literally worse than the Nazi leaders convicted at Nuremberg of crimes against humanity.  The article uses the incoherent propaganda term "intellectual property", which the pharma companies love because it interferes with critical thinking about their unjust demands.  The pharma companies claim that only patents can enable them to do research into new lifesaving drugs, but the fact is they don't do much of that research. It is usually government funded.  14 October 2014 (Dow Chemical cover-up)  Dow Chemical covered up knowledge of the medical damage done by its toxic pesticide, chlorpyrifos; now the question is whether the EPA has the guts to do its job to prevent more sickness.  14 October 2014 (Thousands march in St Louis)  Thousands marched in St Louis on behalf of Michael Brown and against thug violence. Fortunately, this time the thugs did not engage in more violence against the protesters.  14 October 2014 (Urgent: Protect all waterways)  US citizens: call on the EPA to protect all waterways.  14 October 2014 (Centralized social networks)  Centralized social networks can learn a lot about people that don't directly give them data, through what others say about them and even who knows them.  In other words, you should insist that your friends not mention you by name or email address in anything they post on centralized social networks.  I think this applies to gmail as well.  14 October 2014 (Plutocratic governments)  Business is the "enemy within" countries with plutocratic governments.  14 October 2014 (RSA's secret contract with NSA)  When RSA installed key generation code that had been weakened by the NSA, it wasn't just ingenuous &mdash; it took money from the NSA to do so.  14 October 2014 (Removal of "Carbon Sink" sculpture)  Fossil fuel companies and their pet politicians made the University of Wyoming get rid of a sculpture that reminded people about the effects of global heating on forests in that region.  14 October 2014 (Domestic "coercive control")  There is a proposal in the UK to prohibit domestic "coercive control", but identifying that might require a difficult judgment call.  What strikes me is that the methods used for domestic coercive control have a lot in common with the methods used for enslavement of farm laborers and domestic workers. Criminalizing such enslavement has not been very effective at stopping it. Could it be more effective to change other systems so that these methods of control can't be used or don't work?  For instance, if banks automatically gave one spouse access to a limited amount of money from the other spouse's account &mdash; not enough to substantially harm the other spouse, but enough for the one spouse to get by &mdash; one element of coercive control would not work. If spouses were required to jointly view the deed of their residence once in a while, another element used in this instance would not be possible. Other elements could also be blocked.  Enough such concrete measures would often prevent coercive control, and otherwise would make it require a cut-and-dried violation that could be prosecuted easily without a difficult judgment call.  14 October 2014 (Publication of autobiography stopped)  A UK court stopped publication of an autobiography on the grounds that it might cause pain to the author's son.  In the US, which respects freedom of speech much more than the UK, this decision would be called "prior restraint", which is more or less unconstitutional, though I would not trust today's US Supreme Court to stand by that principle or (any human right, when it's for actual humans rather than corporations).  14 October 2014 (Death of an Unpunished Dictator)  Reflections on the Death of an Unpunished Dictator.  14 October 2014 (Deadly shootings by thugs)  A young black male is 21 times more likely to be shot dead by US thugs than a young white male.  14 October 2014 (US military budget)  Obama pretends that the US military budget has suffered intolerable cuts.  14 October 2014 (Damage to coral reefs from CO2)  The damage to coral reefs from CO2 could amount to a trillion dollars annually in losses to humanity, by the end of this century.  14 October 2014 (Reporter faces imprisonment in Korea)  A Japanese reporter in Korea faces 7 years imprisonment for reporting the existence of a rumor about the president.  Did you think it must be North Korea, which is of course a total tyranny? Sad to say, it is South Korea.  If the report was false &mdash; if the rumor did not exist &mdash; it might be legitimate to sue the reporter for claiming it did. However, nothing can justify prosecution for an insult. Freedom of speech means having the right to insult everyone, even President Park, even me, even you.  14 October 2014 (Danger of debt crisis)  Dozens of poor countries are in danger of sliding into a debt crisis.  Many of these debts were more or less imposed by outside pressure and accepted by rulers that were tyrants or traitors. Those debts should be considered entirely invalid.  14 October 2014 (European Commission proposes insane blanket deregulation)  The European Commission proposes insane blanket deregulation (except for the biggest companies). The rest would be allowed to pollute however they like.  14 October 2014 (Theocratic fascism)  Identifying PISSI as a form of theocratic fascism.  14 October 2014 (Urgent: Stop pinkwashing toxic and carcinogenic fracking)  Everyone: call on the Susan G. Komen Foundation to stop pinkwashing toxic and carcinogenic fracking.  More information.  14 October 2014 (Reagan's order 12333)  Reagan's order 12333 lets the US government collect all sorts of data about Americans by copying it from mirror servers located outside the US.  Meanwhile, Snowden says that snooping by the UK government on its cities has no practical limit.  14 October 2014 (Hong Kong protesters being attacked)  Hong Kong protesters are being attacked with military-grade Chinese malware.  14 October 2014 (UK National Health Service underfunded)  The UK National Health Service is so underfunded that it is paying staff poverty wages.  The NHS needs a lot more money, and it needs to come from the rich (including businesses). However, making housing cheaper would help the workers get by; that too depends on increasing taxes on the homes of the rich.  14 October 2014 (Putin has withdrawn a substantial fraction of troops from near border)  Putin has withdrawn a substantial fraction of troops from near the border with Ukraine.  This could still leave substantial numbers to sneak into Ukraine and attack.  14 October 2014 (California aquifers contaminated)  California aquifers contaminated with billions of gallons of fracking wastewater.  14 October 2014 (Attempt to block block nuclear power plants)  There will be a last-ditch attempt to block two new nuclear power plants in the UK, on the grounds that the subsidy will be a burden for the country.  The reason that it is a burden is that the same amount of money could buy a lot more in renewable energy and negawatts (improved efficiency).  13 October 2014 (HK democracy protests resume)  Hong Kong democracy protesters have resumed large protests after the government reneged on talks.  13 October 2014 (NY airplane cleaners on strike)  Airplane cleaners in New York went on strike demanding protection from diseases in vomit and shit that they have to clean up.  13 October 2014 (US coal mine methane leaks)  Satellite data suggest that coal mines in the US southwest are leaking lots of methane.  13 October 2014 (Wisconsin voter-ID law blocked)  The US Supreme Court blocked the voter-ID law in Wisconsin.  13 October 2014 (Carbon-neutral homes)  The Netherlands has renovated 300,000 apartments so that they don't need fossil fuel or external electricity, and 100,000 will be renovated in the UK.  This scheme is very good, but its scale is minuscule: 100,000 homes in a country of 64 million people is a drop in the bucket. Its significance is to show that humanity can still save itself from global heating disaster, if it can overcome plutocracy to do similar things on a large scale.  13 October 2014 (Allowing thugs to confer to coordinate testimony)  UK thug chiefs insist on allowing thugs to confer to coordinate their testimony.  13 October 2014 (Urgent: Pass the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act)  US citizens: call on Congress to pass the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act.  13 October 2014 (Urgent: Pressure Turkey to let Kurds cross the border)  Everyone: Call on Obama to pressure Turkey to let Kurds cross the border, whether to defend Kobani or escape from massacre there.  13 October 2014 (Court order to get journalists' phone records)  The UK will require a court order to get journalists' phone records.  That is a small step in the right direction. I have to ask, however, who this will apply to. On the internet, anyone can be a journalist.  In addition, journalists reporting on ticklish issues such as government snooping must arrange to communicate with their sources in a way that can't be tracked.  13 October 2014 (Cuba fighting Ebola)  Cuba has sent more doctors to fight Ebola than any other country.  13 October 2014 (Facebook to get even more info on digital activities)  Facebook now combines "Like" button tracking data with data from Facebook itself to get even more information about people's digital activities.  Facebook does not tell other companies the identities of users, but they can identify users based on data they get elsewhere.  "Like" button surveillance even tracks people who are not useds of Facebook (i.e., never had a Facebook account).  However, you can block "Like" button tracking with the GNU browser, IceCat.  13 October 2014 (Urgent: Take action against TTIP)  Citizens of Europe and the US: take action against TTIP (This Treaty Is Plutocratic).  13 October 2014 (Saudi Arabia repressing anyone that endorses human rights)  Saudi Arabia, always tyrannical, is now systematically repressing anyone that endorses human rights.  13 October 2014 (Vietnam War)  The Pentagon is trying to paint the Vietnam War as a glorious triumph.  13 October 2014 (Biggest decrease in standard of living)  British workers are experiencing the biggest decrease in standard of living in 150 years.  13 October 2014 (Overprotecting children)  In the US today, parents who would dare resist overprotecting their children face threats from other parents.  When I was six years old, I walked 5 blocks to school in Manhattan. Not that I was unusual &mdash; this is how everyone got to school. We all knew how to cross streets. We all understood traffic lights, since there were traffic lights at every intersection.  13 October 2014 (No Fly List)  For the first time, the US government has officially informed 13 Americans whether they are on the No Fly List.  This is just a small step towards justice. The No Fly List is a deprivation of rights. The US government should not be allowed to put anyone on this list without a trial.  13 October 2014 (Local pollution in parts of the Great Barrier Reef)  Local pollution in parts of the Great Barrier Reef impedes photosynthesis, which leads to higher CO2 levels locally.  12 October 2014 (Arrest of Kurds in Turkey)  Kurds fleeing into Turkey have been arrested without charges and accused of fighting PISSI.  It's unlikely to be true, since some of them are children. However, if some of them really did fight PISSI, it is disgusting to punish anyone for that.  12 October 2014 (Big banks face criminal charges)  Big US banks once again face criminal charges, but the executives will probably get off unscathed yet again.  12 October 2014 (TTIP)  The European Commission is inventing strained legalistic excuses to block a referendum opposing the TTIP.  12 October 2014 (UK agricultural workers exploited)  Agricultural workers in the UK are stripped of their passports and their pay, and gouged on rent.  This is a world-wide pattern, much like what happens to construction workers in Qatar.  A government that doesn't want to let businesses exploit people could adopt laws that make it harder to get away with this. One approach would be to make the farms directly liable for how the temp agency treats the temporary workers. It would help to prosecute the executives and staff of the temp agency, as well as the agency, for any wrongdoing; I can't tell from the article whether this is already done.  12 October 2014 (Mexico protests)  Large protests around Mexico demand release of the 43 students disappeared by thugs.  It looks like the thugs murdered them, but this is not yet certain.  12 October 2014 (Philadelphia students strike)  Philadelphia students went on strike in solidarity with their teachers, whose contract was cancelled.  12 October 2014 (Public defense failure)  Manuel Velez was convicted of murder because the public defender didn't bother to investigate the evidence that proved he was innocent.  The cruel prosecutors gave him a choice between a new trial (on charges already known to be false), which would probably have meant keeping him in jail for a year or two, and pleading guilty to a smaller false charge. Evidently they are more interested in pretending they are never wrong than in justice.  The main cause of these repeated injustices is that we don't have enough public defenders in the US. They can't possibly do a proper job for so many clients. Most of the time they advise clients to make a deal and accept a lesser charge, whether it is true or not.  12 October 2014 (Urgent: Approve Vivek Murthy as Surgeon General)  US citizens: call on the Senate to resist the NRA and approve Vivek Murthy as Surgeon General.  12 October 2014 (Control of forests)  Arguing that putting the local inhabitants or indigenous people in control of forests works better than REDD for ending deforestation.  I see some questionable points. For instance, the danger that the forest's trees may die even if protected exists no matter how we try to protect them. Global heating is killing a lot of pine trees in the US.  12 October 2014 (Customers' call records)  UK mobile phone networks' computers provide customers' call records to the state automatically whenever asked, without even checking for a legally valid order.  A legally valid order made by thugs, without the need to justify it to anyone, is not morally valid.  11 October 2014 (Sharif Mobley)  The US government says it knows where Sharif Mobley is, but refuses to tell his family.  11 October 2014 (NSA sends agents to install spy devices)  The NSA sends agents to install spy devices in networks in various countries, including apparently the US.  For the US government to do this to a rather hostile government such as China does not seem wrong to me. Doing this to Germany and South Korea would be a low blow against an ally if it was done without those states' approval (we don't know). If those states approved of the act, it might mean that they are spying massively on their own citizens.  11 October 2014 (Urgent: Limit US war in Syria and Iraq)  US citizens: call on Congress and Obama to limit US war in Syria and Iraq.  11 October 2014 (Campaign to slow down installation of solar power in the US)  Walmart's owners support organizations that campaign to slow down installation of solar power in the US.  11 October 2014 (Corporate land grabs and "development")  Farmers and indigenous peoples are protesting the World Bank's support for corporate land grabs and "development" that helps business take from the poor.  11 October 2014 (Malala Yousufzai can't return home)  Malala Yousufzai, admired around the world, can't return home because of death threats from the Taliban.  11 October 2014 (Turkey denying entry to refugees)  Turkey is denying entry to 10,000 Kurdish civilian refugees trying to flee Kobani.  The US could airdrop ammunition and food to the Kurds fighting for Kobani. Since the plan is already to arm opponents of PISSI, why not these, now?  11 October 2014 (Sugar consumption made memory worse)  An experiment on adolescent rats finds that heavy sugar consumption made their memory worse.  This does not prove sugar has the same effects on human adolescents, but it might be so.  Other studies have found that low-calorie sweeteners fool the brain into preparing for sugar, causing confusion when the calories do not arrive.  11 October 2014 (Resistance by indigenous peoples)  Amnesty International says that the government of Guatemala, together with Canadian mining companies, provoke resistance by indigenous peoples by setting up mines near their homes without consulting them.  11 October 2014 (Transport of toxic chemicals by rail)  A train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed in the middle of a Canadian town.  No one was directly injured, but the toxic smoke from the burning chemicals may cause people respiratory problems down the line.  11 October 2014 (Walmart trying to cut health insurance)  Walmart is pushing reducing the hours on 30,000 workers so as to deny them health insurance.  The US laws that associate medical care with employment implement a bad policy. For instance, it is an incentive to replace workers with robots. Companies should pay for people's health care through taxes that would only increase if the company replaces workers with robots. The laws ought to be changed so that everyone gets medical care, regardless of the person's life situation.  This does not excuse Walmart's conduct. Ethics are separate from law; taking advantage of a bad law to screw people legally is just as wrong as screwing them illegally.  11 October 2014 (Boston thug racism)  The ACLU studied statistics on how Boston thugs searched pedestrians and found a gross pattern of racism.  11 October 2014 (NSA propaganda activities)  The NSA was asked for a list of the information it has disclosed to reporters. It responded that the list is too secret to show.  The NSA is trying to hide its propaganda activities.  11 October 2014 (Crypto Wars Redux)  Crypto Wars Redux: Why the FBI's Desire to Unlock Your Private Life Must Be Resisted.  11 October 2014 (Defending Kobani against PISSI)  The US has begun bombing PISSI fighters attacking Kobani. Since then, Kurdish forces have started advancing.  PISSI is the Pseudo-Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.  11 October 2014 (Lego cancels Shell marketing)  A pressure campaign (which I supported here) has convinced Lego to cancel its marketing collaboration with Shell.  This sort of thing is very important: we need to strip the fossil fuel companies of the little maneuvers that they use to disguise the murderous nature of their plans.  11 October 2014 (Ebola)  Hundreds of thousands of fools wanted to risk spreading Ebola to humans to save a dog.  Nobody knows whether a dog can pass Ebola to humans, but let's not find out the hard way.  11 October 2014 (Australian journalists and sources)  Australia proposes to imprison journalists and their sources for publishing information about secret searches of people's homes.  10 October 2014 (Urgent: Protect coral and sponge habitat)  US citizens: call on the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to protect coral and sponge habitat in the Bering Sea.  10 October 2014 (Giant coal mine in Australia)  Indian environmentalists are suing to block a giant coal mine in Australia which would export coal to pollute India (as well as polluting the whole world with CO2).  10 October 2014 (Mass surveillance of phone users)  Despite everything the US government says about encryption in phones, the fact is that they still make massive surveillance of everyone easier than before people used them.  10 October 2014 (False confessions)  Burmese expatriates in Thailand confessed to killing two British tourists, but now they say they were tortured into a false confession.  I believe them.  10 October 2014 (US jails mentally ill poor)  In the US, people with harmless mental illnesses end up in jail unless they are rich.  Once jailed, they are put in debt for their imprisonment, so they may never be able to get out.  10 October 2014 (Human cab drivers)  Uber plans to do away with human cab drivers.  It would be easy for a non-plutocratic government to prohibit this, and that's what every country ought to do, unless/until every person gets an adequate basic income so people don't need to be employed.  10 October 2014 (Educational success)  Children of East Asian (mainly Chinese) immigrants excel even in mediocre Australian schools.  This suggests that the root cause of the high educational success of various East Asian countries may not be particularly due to how the schools there are run.  10 October 2014 (ACLU legal victory in Ferguson)  The ACLU won a legal victory: the Ferguson thugs are not allowed to arrest protesters just for standing still.  10 October 2014 (Massive Mongolian Mine)  Massive Mongolian Mine Endangers Nomads' Water, Way of Life.  However, the bigger culprit is global heating, which is hitting Mongolia more than most of the world, and drying it up.  10 October 2014 (Mercury pollution hurts songbirds)  Mercury pollution damages the brains of songbirds.  10 October 2014 (Criminal record)  65 million Americans have a criminal record; many US colleges exclude all of them in blanket fashion.  10 October 2014 (Employers plead for sympathy)  Employers plead for sympathy because they can't find people to hire, but really it's just that they won't pay enough.  10 October 2014 (Fight to Tax Soda in San Francisco)  Inside the $7 Million Fight to Tax Soda in San Francisco.  10 October 2014 (Jewish National Fund)  The Jewish National Fund is actively involved in trying to kick a Palestinian family out of its home near Jerusalem.  Some of the JNF's tree planting campaigns were carried out over former Arab villages whose inhabitants had either fled or been expelled.  10 October 2014 (Ebola epidemic)  The World Bank says 20 billion dollars must be provided to quash the Ebola epidemic.  10 October 2014 (EU Climate and Energy Commissioner)  Former Oil Mogul Confirmed as EU Climate and Energy Commissioner.  He will surely find ways to obstruct progress in decarbonization; whoever proposed him for the post must have done so with this goal in mind. Whatever controls are set up to make sure he does his job, they can't stop him from dragging his feet.  Thus, I fear, the fossil fuel companies have neutralized the only center of political power that was sincerely trying to avert global heating. I fear that they have murdered many of those who are reading this.  10 October 2014 (A law making it easier for businesses to fire workers)  Italy's prime minister Renzi pushed through a law making it easier for businesses to fire workers, hoping that in exchange the EU will avoid punishing Italy more.  These "reforms" are part of the world-wide campaign by business to set countries against each other in a competition for letting business have more power and workers less power. Step by step, business gets to do want it wants, leaving most people poor.  I doubt that the plutocrats will keep their side of this deal. Appeasing them is foolish; the more power they get, the more they can demand more power.  10 October 2014 (Rebel group has taken the capital of Yemen)  A Shi'ite rebel group has taken the capital of Yemen, perhaps with the cooperation of the president.  It opposes the Wahhabi missionaries sent by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia seems to be the root of a large part of the theocratic cruelty in the Arab world, and spreads this with the backing of the US.  10 October 2014 (A thug in St Louis shot a black teenager)  A thug in St Louis shot a black teenager, then claimed the teenager had fired shots with the sandwich his friends said he was carrying.  It would not be beyond a thug to plant a gun on the deceased.  10 October 2014 (Facebook and Master Card will join forces)  Facebook and Master Card will join forces to profile Master Card customers so banks can push them to spend more.  By doing this, Master Card is ratting on its customers. This reinforces the point that using a credit card enables others to take advantage of you. It also interferes with your efforts to limit your spending.  Don't be tracked &mdash; pay cash.  09 October 2014 (Ebola)  Ebola virus may persist a human's semen and milk months after the person has recovered from it.  09 October 2014 (Turkey allows reinforcements to join PISSI)  Turkey is blocking Kurds from joining the defense of Kobani, while allowing reinforcements to join PISSI.  09 October 2014 (Business domination of public TV)  US public TV governing boards are dominated by business executives.  Business also dominates public TV stations through its money.  09 October 2014 (50,000 SWAT raids per year)  With 50,000 SWAT raids per year in the US, lots of people will inevitably get hurt badly.  09 October 2014 (Superstition leads to murder in UK)  Superstition about witches leads to murder, even in the UK.  09 October 2014 (Australia spying law)  Australia Spying Law Meets Grassroots Resistance.  The Australian government's duty is to keep Australians safe &hellip; from total surveillance.  09 October 2014 (Democracy in Syria)  Revolutionary Kurds in Syria have established the sort of popular democracy we would hope that the whole Middle East could have.  09 October 2014 (Release of Brit jailed in Morocco)  The British tourist jailed in Morocco for being homosexual was released. His Moroccan friend or lover is not so fortunate.  09 October 2014 (Helping wildlife by legalizing marijuana)  Extinction of wildlife is another problem that the US could partially solve by legalizing marijuana.  09 October 2014 (Thugs sued)  Jamal Jones is suing thugs for breaking car windows and attacking him only for not carrying identification (which he had no obligation to carry).  It is not enough to sue the thugs and the city; that is no deterrent for thugs. We need to prosecute them.  I hope, if you are ever on a jury, that you will reject any presumption that thugs are telling the truth. Lying in court is habitual with them.  09 October 2014 (Attacks on Palestinians' water supply)  Israel has repeatedly attacked Palestinians' water supply and sewage systems for more than a decade.  09 October 2014 (Israel to demolish homes)  Israeli soldiers told the inhabitants of the village of Khirbet Um al-Jimal that all their homes will be demolished at some undetermined date.  09 October 2014 (Glasgow University voted to divest from fossil fuels)  Glasgow University voted to divest from fossil fuels.  09 October 2014 (Urgent: Allow requests for funds for abortions)  Everyone: tell GoFundMe to allow requests for funds for abortions. Abortion is not like terrorism, violence or addictive drugs.  09 October 2014 (Urgent: Distributing military hardware to thug departments)  US citizens: call on the Pentagon to stop distributing military hardware to thug departments in the US.  09 October 2014 (Adobe's "digital editions" spy system)  Adobe "digital editions" spy system sends users' complete reading logs to Amazon.  Adobe says this is legitimate because users agree to it in the EULA, but pressuring people to click "Ok, spy on me" does not excuse it.  This article focuses on the fact that the NSA can watch this data passing on the net, avoiding the need to use the PAT RIOT act to collect it directly from Adobe. It legitimizes the snooping by saying that's needed to enforce DRM, which legitimizes DRM too. According to the article's view, all this would be fine, if only Adobe didn't also leak everyone's dossier.  As a defense of readers' rights, this is pitifully weak. DRM, being evil itself, can't justify anything.  09 October 2014 (Windows 10 total snooping)  Windows 10 requires users to give permission for total snooping on their files, commands, text input, and voice.  09 October 2014 (Cruel UK prisons)  UK prisons have become so cruel that the government plans to fire the inspector of prisons.  09 October 2014 (Baltimore's inner harbor)  Baltimore's inner harbor will be flooded roughly 900 hours a year, on the average, by 2045 &mdash; due to global heating.  A few decades later, it will be permanently inundated.  Many other US coastal cities and towns face similar problems that we are bringing on ourselves.  09 October 2014 (US food products containing soy or corn)  Consumer Reports found that nearly all US food products containing soy or corn are made with GMOs, even if they are misleadingly labeled as "natural".  09 October 2014 (Clinton endorsed policy of endless war)  Clinton has openly endorsed the policy of endless war.  Put this together with NSA snooping and the systematic dishonesty of the mainstream press, and it adds up to 1984 lite.  The main threat to Americans comes from plutocracy. Plutocracy could kill millions of Americans in the coming decade, mainly through the poverty it imposes. Compared with this, underground terrorists are a tiny threat.  Back when Dubya was president, I speculated that he and al Qa'ida were both working to cause the endless war that suited them both. It seems the same for the US and PISSI. Not that they have explicitly conspired to do this together. Rather, each side expects to gain domestic power from endless war. So PISSI offers bait, and the US government jumps for it.  09 October 2014 (Terrorism is gift that keeps on giving)  For the fascist plans of US officials, terrorism (real or imaginary) is the gift that keeps on giving.  The author makes a mistake by saying that "we" have adopted these foolish attitudes, because that effectively insists the reader can't reject them. We can all reject them &mdash; it just takes a tiny bit of moral fiber. I reject them every time they come up, and you can, too.  08 October 2014 (Endless war programmed by US officials)  US officials, Republican and Democrat, have programmed an endless war all around the world.  It is endless by nature, because its tactics generate more enemies, and have never won a victory anywhere.  08 October 2014 (US policy distinction between Iraq and Syria)  The US makes an abstract policy distinction between Iraq and Syria, and in Syria only attacks PISSI's logistical support, not its troops. This is why it has not provided close air support to the Kurds fighting to defend Kobani.  Meanwhile, the US wants Turkey to fight this battle, but Turkey would rather fight Assad that PISSI.  Close air support is the only sort of fighting that the US ought to do against PISSI. Once it starts attacking urban facilities, it causes civilian casualties.  08 October 2014 (Exaggeration about PISSI foreigners)  The chance that foreigners fighting for PISSI will return home and commit violence there has been exaggerated beyond what past experience suggests.  Politicians seeking to abolish human rights persistently exaggerate the danger of terrorism.  08 October 2014 (Questioning the claims of "psychics")  The author of leaflets questioning the validity of "psychics"' claims to talk with the dead has been threatened with a lawsuit by a psychic.  08 October 2014 (How Big Pharma bilks Americans)  How the Big Pharma companies make Americans pay more for medicines than people in any other country.  08 October 2014 (Ellsberg on Obama's Iraq strategy)  Daniel Ellsberg judges Obama's Iraq strategy against the facts of the Vietnam War.  08 October 2014 (Criticisms of fracking deleted)  New York Governor Cuomo had criticisms of fracking deleted from a scientific report.  Cuomo pretends to be neutral on the issue while secretly trying to impose fracking on the unwilling citizens of New York.  08 October 2014 (Harassment of US freedom group)  The UK freedom group Cage was almost forced to shut down by official harassment including closure of its bank accounts.  08 October 2014 (Enxet land)  The Enxet people, in Paraguay, keep winning legal victories to get back the land they were kicked off. But the government has been reluctant to implement these decisions.  08 October 2014 (UK NHS grossly underfunded)  The UK National Health Service is so underfunded that it will soon have to charge fees for hospital beds, fees which poor people can't pay.  08 October 2014 (How Nigeria quashed Ebola outbreak)  Nigeria quashed its Ebola outbreak quickly, because it had a strong enough medical system to do what was necessary.  08 October 2014 (The Great Barrier Reef)  Australia has destroyed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's credibility as well as its ability to do is job.  This was not suicide, it was murder: the government wants nothing to stand in the way of its plans that include destroying the reef.  08 October 2014 (Twitter fighting PAT RIOT act)  Twitter is suing to overturn the PAT RIOT act's gag provisions.  08 October 2014 (Urgent: Send a bankster to jail)  US citizens: tell Holder, send a bankster to jail before you leave office.  08 October 2014 (Students killed in Mexico)  In Mexico, plutocratist politicians allied with drug gangs are killing students that oppose the abolition of rural schools.  The plutocrats that dominate Mexico via NAFTA don't want any money to be spent on educating poor rural Mexicans.  08 October 2014 (UK's National Crime Agency)  The National Crime Agency Would Take [The UK] Back to Soviet-Style Surveillance.  08 October 2014 (Young jobless people)  Politicians Should Stop Bullying Young Jobless People into Trying to Find Work.  08 October 2014 (Terrorist movements)  Long experience shows that the only way to deal with terrorist movements (other than small gangs without public support) is to negotiate with them.  This may not apply to PISSI today, which is more of a barbarian horde than a terrorist movement. It can be defeated in battle, at this stage. If that happens, it may morph into a terrorist movement.  08 October 2014 (PISSI capturing Kobani)  PISSI is slowly capturing parts of Kobani.  08 October 2014 (Evidence links Roundup to cancer)  Many forms of evidence link Roundup to increased rates of cancer in humans.  08 October 2014 (Education in Finland)  Finland's schools demand less school time, have hardly any standardized tests, and students come out very well educated.  08 October 2014 (Guantanamo force-feeding videos)  Guantanamo force-feeding videos show that torture is still practiced there, even against prisoners that are admittedly not criminals and have been "cleared for release".  08 October 2014 (UK corporate welfare)  The UK government is talking about cutting human welfare funds to dump people into the street. Why not cut corporate welfare instead?  07 October 2014 (Urgent: No palm oil from destroyed forests)  Everyone: call on giant fast food companies to stop using palm oil from farms created by destroying forests and peat swamps.  07 October 2014 (Urgent: Free Ghoncheh Ghavami)  Everyone: write to the political leaders of Iran on behalf of Ghoncheh Ghavami, an Iranian woman threatened with dying in prison because she wanted to watch a sports match.  07 October 2014 (Urgent: Investigate bank regulators)  US citizens: Call for an investigation of submissive bank regulators that don't dare enforce regulations on Goldman Sachs.  07 October 2014 (Bureaucratization and marketization)  An argument that the bureaucratization and marketization of society is partly responsible for putting an end to major technological advances since 1970.  07 October 2014 (Clinton owes Ray McGovern an apology)  Hillary Clinton owes Ray McGovern an apology, because the State Department under her direction persecuted dissident Ray McGovern.  I agree, but I lost my respect for Ms Clinton long ago for other reasons.  07 October 2014 (Cell phone trackers in NYC phone booths)  500 New York City phone booths have devices to track cell phones that pass by.  The city says it will remove them.  07 October 2014 (Turkey makes trade with PISSI)  Turkey traded PISSI soldiers interned in Turkey for Turkish civilians captured by PISSI.  PISSI is the Pseudo-Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.  07 October 2014 (Biden apologizes for telling truth)  Vice President Biden was forced to apologize for telling the truth about US "allies" that funded the growth of the jihadi movement in Syria (leading to PISSI).  07 October 2014 (UK arms exports to Israel)  UK arms exports to Israel may be illegal under UK law.  06 October 2014 (Obama's plan to fight PISSI)  Obama's plan to strengthen "moderate" Syrian opposition to fight against PISSI has so many problems that the US can't find suitable "moderate" Syrian opposition to support.  06 October 2014 (Cost of global heating)  Estimates of the cost of curbing global heating need to be set against the costs of failing to do so. The medical costs of global heating will be bigger than people realize.  06 October 2014 (Morocco imprisons tourist for "being gay")  Morocco has imprisoned a tourist, convicting him of "being gay".  06 October 2014 (HK executive's strategy against protesters)  The Hong Kong executive defeated the protesters by waiting for them to lose hope.  06 October 2014 (The World's Open Dumps Are Growing)  Smelly, Contaminated, Full of Disease: the World's Open Dumps Are Growing.  06 October 2014 (A monstrous censorship law)  Australian senators voted for a monstrous censorship law without reading it.  If you see government agents kill people, either accidentally or intentionally, it will be illegal for you to tell anyone.  06 October 2014 (UK thugs to investigate themselves)  UK thugs have been directed to investigate their own intimidation of political activists.  06 October 2014 (Staff take sexual advantage of prisoners)  In a privatized immigration prison in Texas, the staff take sexual advantage of the prisoners.  In ordinary language, a prisoner is anyone kept in prison. When the authorities try to impose distinctions, with words such as "detainee", I think that is a plan to avoid the odium of the word "prisoner" for cases such as these. Why help them? I call these people "prisoner".  06 October 2014 (Clinton admits anti-democratic meddling)  Clinton admits in her book that, while claiming to support returning Zelaya to the presidency of Honduras, she was actually moving secretly to prevent his return.  06 October 2014 (Urgent: Labeling "pink slime")  US citizens: call on the USDA to require labeling of food containing ammonia-treated meat, "pink slime".  06 October 2014 (Expensive unnecessary dental work)  Dentists in the US are increasingly likely to recommend expensive unnecessary dental work.  This appears to be due to the economic pressure placed on dentists by changes in dentistry, including large companies with hundreds of offices.  06 October 2014 (Universal basic health care)  The Ebola epidemic shows the need for universal basic health care to extend even to the poorest places.  06 October 2014 (Strong target for energy efficiency)  The UK could boost the economy, and not only for the wealthy, by setting a strong target for energy efficiency.  The government is not interested, perhaps because it aims to make workers desperate and penurious, not make jobs.  06 October 2014 (Phone call metadata)  UK thugs used a journalist's phone call metadata to identify a source, after a judge told them they were not entitled to that information.  They used the notorious R.I.P. act, which was the death knell for privacy of communications in the UK. This law also makes it a crime not to answer thugs' questions.  06 October 2014 (PISSI's script)  If you want to "do something" about PISSI (aka ISIS), be careful you are not following their script.  06 October 2014 (Global heating threatens agriculture)  Latin America has mostly eliminated hunger, but global heating threatens to bring it back by damaging agriculture.  A growing population won't help.  06 October 2014 (US thugs attacking CopWatch)  US thugs around the country are attacking CopWatch groups and their leaders with threats and even bogus arrests.  Is spitting in a thug's face really a felony? If so, the first step in ending the thugs' reign of terror is to change that law &mdash; and many others with it. Thugs regularly abuse their power; they must have less of it.  06 October 2014 (Support for HK protests)  Some US dissidents are claiming that the Hong Kong protests are a US plot.  Those critics seem to be more anti-US than pro-freedom.  If the US is indeed supporting the protests in Hong Kong, I'm glad that for once it is doing something good. I'd say the same thing if it were demonstrated that China or Venezuela had supported Occupy Wall Street or other legitimate democratic activity in the US.  06 October 2014 (HeForShe manifesto)  I support Emma Watson's HeForShe manifesto.  It took me a while to find it in textual form; I don't want to link to a video that would lead people to run nonfree software.  06 October 2014 (Using TTIP to attack regulations)  Chemical companies are using the TTIP to attack regulations to protect against toxic chemical spills.  06 October 2014 (Monopolies on old drugs)  An inexpensive 20-year-old drug for an unusual medical condition may soon cost patients $80,000, due to a legal maneuver by drug barons.  The long-known generic drug colchicine, used for gout, was made a monopoly through a similar maneuver.  The same sort of corrupt scheme for new monopolies on old drugs exists in Europe. These monopolies, applied to drugs that were already available, are an  additional reason to distrust everything drug companies say to argue for patents on even new medicines. I think they just want monopolies.  06 October 2014 (Continued support for Afghan gov't)  Obama has signed an agreement with the contrived Afghan government to keep propping it up for 10 more years.  06 October 2014 (NSA snooping "authorized")  Most NSA snooping is "authorized" by Reagan's executive order 12333. This snooping has no oversight by Congress or courts. Although the government says this is to prevent "terrorism", that is nothing more than an all-purpose excuse.  06 October 2014 (Video games)  A list of ethical issues that someone else sees in regard to video games.  I agree with most of them, but conspicuously absent is the direct injustice that most video games commit against their users: the game software is not free/libre. Indeed, the article goes so far as to condemn "unsanctioned clones" for being "free" (i.e., gratis, not freedom-respecting). That's where I disagree with the article.  06 October 2014 (Facing an age of extinction)  Humanity is pounding the natural world so hard that even common species are not safe from extinction. Many species that humans depend on face extinction.  Don't forget that a the species that inspire human interest, such as tigers, orangutans and pandas, are used for campaigns to protect the entire ecosystems they live in; if we lose them, it will be because we lost the thousands of other species that live along with them.  06 October 2014 (Tories' proposed tax cuts)  The Tories' proposed tax cuts will help only the non-poor, while the benefit cuts to pay for them will shaft the poor.  We've seen similar dooH niboR misdirection from US Republicans, who got support from foolish workers who these same Republicans then impoverish.  05 October 2014 (Urgent: End the siege of Gaza)  US citizens: call on Congress and Obama to direct US diplomacy towards ending the siege of Gaza.  05 October 2014 (Extremists in Japanese gov't)  Right-wing extremists in the Japanese government are denying the facts about forcing women from conquered peoples to act as prostitutes for Japanese soldiers.  The worst crime was committed by the societies that despised these women for the way they were treated. Many of them did not go home after the war, certain their families would reject them.  05 October 2014 (Arming "moderate" Syrian rebels)  Obama's strategy of arming "moderate" Syrian rebels to defeat PISSI is fantasy, and even confirmed Syrian enemies of Assad say so.  Even a right-wing commentator acknowledges this.  So did Obama, not long ago. (Search the article for "fantasy".)  On the other hand, if the Turkish army is willing to fight PISSI in Syria, it could win. Since Turkey is mainly Sunni, Syrian Sunnis who fear Assad would massacre them for their sect could trust Turkey not to do that. (Turkey is no great defender of human rights, but it may be good enough for this.) This might enable the Syrian Sunnis to reject PISSI.  Other things could go wrong: the Turkish army might start fighting Kurds in Syria, for instance. But there is hope of avoiding that.  There are many problems with Obama's plan for dealing with PISSI.  5 October 2014 (Senate)  If the Senate continues blocking the small reform of the "USA Freedom Act", parts of it will  expire entirely next year.  Let's hope so.  5 October 2014 (2022 Olympic Games)  Four cities have dropped their bids for the 2022 Olympic Games, because the  IOC demands too much money.  The only remaining bids are from corrupt, tyrannical countries which don't care.  5 October 2014 (Turkish) As PISSI closes in on Kobani, Turkish troops  have not intervened.  05 October 2014 (Hong Kong anti-protesters)  A Hong Kong opposition legislator accuses the government of sending gangsters to attack the protesters.  It looks like the thugs, or some of them, cooperated with the gangsters.  Even if some of the anti-protesters are being honest about their motives, they are unpatriotic to put their immediate income above democracy. Shame on them!  Naturally, China's imposed "chief executive" cites the danger of more such nonuniformed attacks against the protests as an excuse to order a uniformed attack against the protest. That's tyrant logic for you. We should be prepared to denounce it when we see it in our own countries.  05 October 2014 (Ignoring global heating)  The more subtle form of global heating denial: rather than denying outright that fossil fuels are making the Earth hotter, simply ignoring this in discussing issues where it is significant.  05 October 2014 (Netanyahu's and Abbas's UN speeches)  Uri Avnery: What do Netanyahu's and Abbas's UN speeches mean?  05 October 2014 (Investment in renewable energy)  Naomi Klein says, although private businesses invest in renewable energy for their own interests, we need four times as much investment as what they are doing, and there is no reason to expect businesses to go that far without the state's help or pressure.  The enormous government subsidies for fossil fuels are pertinent here, because they push the market towards fossil fuels, and will continue to do so. Transferring the subsidy to renewables would push the market towards renewables, and a carbon tax would do likewise.  05 October 2014 (Sunni tribal leaders distrust Obama)  Sunni tribal leaders in Iraq do not trust Obama's new "Iraqi government" not to oppress them, so they feel they must stay on the side of PISSI.  05 October 2014 (Koch brothers' toxic empire)  The Koch brothers' toxic empire is toxic to the financial system as well as to the biosphere.  05 October 2014 (Labeling food with GMOs)  Labeling food with GMOs will cost food businesses a total of less than a penny per day per consumer.  05 October 2014 (Bloodthirsty republicans)  Bloodthirsty republicans want to kill people who try to get into the White House, rather than arresting them.  05 October 2014 (Americans should be protesting, too)  Lessig: Americans should be protesting for democracy like the people of Hong Kong.  05 October 2014 (Holder's Disappointing Tech Legacy)  Holder's Disappointing Tech Legacy.  05 October 2014 (Brain myth)  Debunking the myth that we "only use 10% of our brains".  Every part of the brain gets used in various kinds of mental processes.  05 October 2014 (Thatcher)  Margaret Thatcher was planning to call striking miners, and the whole Labour Party, "the enemy within", more or less traitors. Only an opportune terrorist bombing led her to change her rhetoric. But her systematic state violence and frame-ups made her the real "enemy within".  Millions of Britons had good reason to celebrate Thatcher's death, but her successors today are pushing far beyond Thatcher to push them into penury. Today's Tories don't speak with venom about the non-rich but kick them harder.  Companies with Links to Tories "Have Won £1.5bn Worth of NHS Contracts."  If the NHS contracts work out to companies, the companies will get their profits by squeezing either the patients or the employees. Such contracts should not be allowed at all.  05 October 2014 (Being self-employed)  Nowadays, being self-employed mostly means doing an unglamorous job with no job security and does not get a living wage.  Being an entrepreneur (not counting funded startups) means taking a risk with your money &mdash; gambling on your success. There's a small chance you will make a lot, and a big chance you will lose all.  You shouldn't gamble what you can't afford to lose, and nowadays most Americans (and Britons) are so close to the edge that they can't afford to lose anything. Therefore, it is foolish for them to be "entrepreneurial". When politicians say they want most people to be "entrepreneurial," it means they intend to make most people's lives risky.  05 October 2014 (Guantanamo force-feeding videos)  Judge Kessler ordered the US government to publish videos of force-feeding in Guantanamo.  05 October 2014 (Russian proxy invasion of Ukraine)  The Russian proxy invasion of Ukraine is trying to capture Donetsk airport with tanks.  05 October 2014 (Profiting from US prisoners)  US prisons make prisoners pay for food, medical care, even toilet paper. If relatives want to give prisoners money for this, they have to go thru companies that take almost half the money.  The other way prisoners can pay for this is by working, for a pittance, for private companies, thus undermining the standard of living for Americans not in prison.  It should be forbidden for the government to contract parts of its operations to companies in this way. They should all be done by people with civil service jobs. But prison should not make prisoners or their poor relatives pay for what they need either to live, to be healthy, or to be rehabilitated.  And when prisoners work for companies, they must be paid the prevailing wage for the work they do.  04 October 2014 (Very urgent: Oppose neonicotinoid dose increase)  US citizens: oppose Syngenta's request to increase the dose of bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticides.  04 October 2014 (DRM in coffee machines)  Keurig, the company that brought DRM to coffee machines, is being sued in Canada for it.  04 October 2014 (Plutocrats targeting middle class)  Now that the plutocrats have reduced UK workers to penury, they are targeting what's left of the middle class.  04 October 2014 (Tar sands strip mining in Utah)  Protesters oppose tar sand strip mining in Utah. As in Canada, these mines cause tremendous local environmental damage while advancing global heating disaster.  04 October 2014 (Obama's justification for attacking PISSI)  Obama says that PISSI is part of al-Qa'ida, as justification for attacking PISSI, even though the two are fighting each other.  Reportedly al-Nusra recently said it was allying with PISSI. If that really happens, it would validate Obama's argument.  However, I don't think the US should be authorized to make war everywhere in the world by a 13-year-old vote.  03 October 2014 (Urgent: Support network neutrality)  US citizens: call on the other Democratic FCC commissioners to support network neutrality.  03 October 2014 (Non-denial denials)  Non-denial denials should make reporters suspicious.  03 October 2014 (Judging women by their femininity)  Sexism in everyday life manifests by judging women by their femininity, even in contexts where their capabilities and achievements are more pertinent.  03 October 2014 (The killing of Palestinians suspected of murder)  In Israel, even ministers describe the killing of Palestinians suspected of murder as an "assassination", and the official in charge says he chose not to try to arrest them.  (This is the last of several topics covered in the article.)  03 October 2014 (Sweden will officially recognize Palestine)  Sweden will officially recognize Palestine.  03 October 2014 (European convention on human rights)  The Tories would withdraw the UK from the the European convention on human rights.  03 October 2014 (Turkey will fight to protect Kobani from PISSI)  Turkey will fight to protect Kobani from PISSI.  I too wonder why the US does not destroy PISSI's tanks that are operating there. There is very little danger of mistaking civilians for a tank.  03 October 2014 (Loss of biodiversity)  Humanity is not on track to meet its commitment to slow down the rate of loss of biodiversity.  03 October 2014 (Hong Kong protest movement)  The "CEO" of Hong Kong refused to resign but agreed to talks with the protest movement.  In Hong Kong, 1000 enemies of democracy attacked 100 democracy protesters.  03 October 2014 (Mass haul-out of walrus)  The mass haul-out of walrus is a symptom of damage to a specific ocean ecosystem that depends on sea ice. With more heating, eventually there won't be any sea ice.  03 October 2014 (Paywall Protected Torrent)  Thom Yorke Sells New Album via Paywall Protected Torrent.  This is much more ethical than other internet music sale schemes. The only thing wrong with it is that paying requires identification and nonfree Javascript code. (We've verified that free bittorrent clients work.)  If they accepted anonymous payment and didn't require Javascript to pay, I could endorse it.  03 October 2014 (Construction in Gaza)  Israel is pressuring the UN to strictly control all construction in Gaza on Israel's behalf.  03 October 2014 (EPA has power to ban mountaintop mines)  A court ruled the EPA has the power to ban mountaintop mines. Now the EPA needs to do this broadly.  Civilization's survival depends on greatly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Making coal (and other fossil fuels) scare is a great way to make the market boost investment in renewables.  03 October 2014 (Urgent: Impeach judge Fuller)  US citizens: call on Congress to impeach judge Fuller.  03 October 2014 (Global heating)  Australia's record hot September, a year ago, would have been a freak occurrence 50 years ago. Global heating has made it a fairly likely event that will happen once every 6 years or so.  03 October 2014 (Export of uranium from Australia)  Australia proposes to drop previous nuclear weapons controls when exporting uranium to India.  03 October 2014 (Obama's demand for secret hearing)  A US judge rejected Obama's demand for a secret hearing about the torture of Guantanamo force feeding.  03 October 2014 (Germany imposes internet filtering)  Germany imposes internet filtering on routers (which I suppose includes those in ISPs as well as those in people's homes), blocking sites with no trial, and claims that the names of the censored sites are a "secret".  A site that posted the list of blocked domains was threatened with blockage itself.  Germany also made a rather shocking claim that posting this list in the US is illegal under US law, on the grounds that some of the censored sites display "child pornography".  Some works are disgusting, but censorship is more disgusting.  "Child pornography" is an all-purpose excuse to attack human rights on the internet. The FBI and Holder are now using it as an excuse to demand to be able to snoop on everyone's computers. This "cure" is worse than the disease.  02 October 2014 (Urgent: Global Frackdown on Oct 11)  Everyone: Participate in the Global Frackdown on Oct 11.  02 October 2014 (Urgent: Unblock voters' registrations)  US citizens: call on Georgia to stop blocking 50,000 voters' registrations.  02 October 2014 (Urgent: Smarter Sentencing Act)  US citizens: call on Congress to pass the Smarter Sentencing Act.  02 October 2014 (Transporting oil by rail)  Railroad companies want to take 7 years to replace the explosion-prone tanker cars used for transporting oil.  Instead, transporting oil should simply be banned starting now. Any time some activity with fossil fuel causes a second problem in addition to global heating, we should ban that activity. If we ban enough of them, it may reduce the use of fossil fuel enough to avert global heating disaster.  03 October 2014 (New York City seawall)  New York City is building a 10-mile-long seawall/recreation-area to prevent flooding for a few decades.  If we don't stop pumping CO2 into the air, no seawall will protect New York City.  02 October 2014 (Religious extremists in Florida)  A town in Florida is under the perpetual legal control of a rich religious extremist who gets support from religious extremist elected officials and religious extremists on the Supreme Court.  02 October 2014 (Goldman Sachs and the Federal Reserve)  Leaked recordings show that the Federal Reserve is too cozy with Goldman Sachs.  This may be partly because the Federal Reserve is owned by private banks.  02 October 2014 (Protesters block Israeli ship in Florida)  US protests blocking unloading of Israeli ships have spread to Tampa.  02 October 2014 (Nobel peace summit cancelled)  A meeting of Nobel peace prize winners was cancelled because South Africa would not give the Dalai Lama a visa to attend.  02 October 2014 (US media supports tyranny in Egypt)  US media supported democracy in Egypt for 6 weeks, but is now firmly (with the US government) on the side of military repression.  02 October 2014 (Sudan flogs women)  In Sudan, women get flogged for not covering their hair. Jailing is common, for women who aren't totally submissive.  02 October 2014 (Corruption in UK's cabinet)  Corruption has been discovered at the center of the UK's cabinet, in someone who is not a minister.  The ministers are overtly corrupt.  02 October 2014 (Spyware to "protect children")  US thugs and prosecutors are distributing software to "protect children", which is really spyware.  Americans are so insanely obsessed with overprotecting children that you can get them to swallow almost any form of abuse in the name of doing that.  02 October 2014 (Euro-zone austerity)  Stiglitz: The euro-zone austerity has caused tremendous harm, all of which could have been avoided.  If you judge these budget cuts in terms of the supposed goals of nations' policies, they are failure. But they are very effective as an intentional shock (as Naomi Klein puts it) to transfer wealth to the plutocrats.  01 October 2014 (Space debris)  Small satellites, "cubesats", are being placed in long-lived orbits thus increasing the danger of collisions that generate space debris.  The disaster shown in the movie Gravity is in fact happening, though far more slowly than in the movie. The question is whether we can find a way to stop it.  In the mean time, we should not do stupid things that are likely to speed it up.  01 October 2014 (Israeli soldiers aid fanatics)  Israeli fanatics, aided by soldiers, forced a Palestinian family out of its apartment in Jerusalem.  The army regularly helps them establish outposts that the government says it has not authorized. (It is misleading to call only these colonies "illegal", since they are all illegal under international law.)  The army demolished an apartment building in Abu Dis, a Palestinian town just across the annexation wall from Jerusalem, not giving the inhabitants time to remove their belongings.  The Palestinian Authority had given permission to build additional three floors, but Israel treats those permits as invalid as an excuse to practice systematic harassment of Palestinians.  01 October 2014 (Facebook)  Facebook now allows people to use aliases,  but only if they are generally known by those aliases.  This is not much better than the previous "real names" policy. You can't have one account to show your boss and your parents and another for your friends.  01 October 2014 (Putin)  Putin remains, in spirit, a Soviet secret policeman who watched the East German tyranny collapse. He is determined to attack any challenge to the regime pre-emptively,  to prevent protesters from winning.  Nothing will convince Putin let go, but sooner or later he will die or become incapacitated. Economic sanctions against Russia may convince Putin's successors not to continue his tyranny.  01 October 2014 (Single Mothers) Single Mothers Are the Real Casualties in  Cameron's Class War.   01 October 2014 (Israel) Israel agreed to allow Gazans to fish 6 miles from shore, but unilaterally went back on the agreement,  and has attacked fishermen just a mile from shore.  01 October 2014 (Hong Kong Students)  Some Hong Kong students are preparing for a  theoretical Chinese invasion.  01 October 2014 (Wealth Hampers)  How concentration of wealth hampers efforts to  make a sustainable civilization.  01 October 2014 (Fracking)   Another danger from fracking: mining the fine-grain sand  it uses can poison water and air.  01 October 2014 (The UK Grown in GDP)  The UK has grown in GDP since the economic crisis, but workers' pay remains lower  than it was before the crisis.  The average decrease is just a few percent, so the UK government plans  to cut aid to the working poor.  The Tories won't be satisfied until they have millions of Britons living in closets.  01 October 2014 (Commercial) A commercial carbon-capture coal-burning  power plant has opened.  In principle this can be part of a solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If other forms of fossil fuel are cheaper, a simple tax can make them more expensive. Subsidizing fossil fuel use is harmful, but subsidizing a decrease in the CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use makes sense.   01 October 2014 (Gaza) Uri Avnery: Palestinian President Abbas offers Israel a partner for negotiations, provided the  negotiations are sincere. Avnery says it is an exaggeration to call the attack on Gaza "genocide", but according to the official definition,  the accusation may be valid.   This case, imposing destructive conditions of life on a part of the targeted people that are likely to kill some fraction of the victims, but nowhere near all of the victims, seems to be an edge case. I tend to think it should not be considered genocide. The official definition may be a little too broad, depending on how it is interpreted. However, I think that is a side issue. Provoking a war as an opportunity to kill and wound 10,000 people is a great crime regardless of whether it qualifies as "genocide".   01 October 2014 (Economic Growth) It's Time to Shout Stop on This War  on the Living World. The world needs economic growth for the benefit of the poor, which can be done together with less waste for the rich; but that is not what plutocratic governments are likely to do.   01 October 2014 (Neocons) Neocons hope to pressure Obama into attacking  Assad as well as PISSI. (PISSI is the Pseudo-Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.)  01 October 2014 (California) California has implemented "gun restraining orders": if you feel a relative is likely to shoot people, you can ask a  judge to order his guns taken away.   01 October 2014 (Israel)  In Israel, people who disagree with prevailing hatred of Palestinians  are fired, attacked, and get death threats.   01 October 2014 (UK Torture) Moazzam Begg, former Guantanamo prisoner and now human rights investigator, was imprisoned in the UK and accused of terrorism after he went to Syria to investigate evidence of UK torture.  He has now been freed. The UK government will violate any rights to prevent the facts about its torture from being brought out in court.   01 October 2014 (Antarctica)  The loss of ice in Antarctica is big enough to affect the Earth's gravity  as measured by satellites.   Melting is unlikely to continue at 500 cubic kilometers per year. The greenhouse gases we have already emitted will make the atmosphere hotter, and melting will speed up.  01 October 2014 (Florida)  Florida thugs tased and arrested a woman as she was walking away after  asking about arrests of other people. I wonder whether she was concerned on general principles or because she saw something that looked wrong.   01 October 2014 (Media) How US corporate media promote  US wars.  01 October 2014 (European Commission)  MEPs are concerned that the European Commission wants to cancel  conservation policies and deregulate instead.  Deregulation of business means that plutocrats have less in their way as they build businesses that make profit for them while poisoning you.   01 October 2014 (Syria)  A food aid worker in Syria tweeted the coordinates of a bunker being used by PISSI. PISSI says it  will kill him for this.   This shows why humanitarian aid workers should remain neutral &mdash; so that they can get the support of all sides in a conflict.   01 October 2014 ("Intelligence Agencies")  The US spends almost 70 billion dollars a year on "intelligence agencies", but they hardly ever predict the major events  that the US might rationally want them to predict. They probably do a good job of suppressing many journalists and protesters.  01 October 2014 (Walruses)  The lack of sea ice has forced 35,000 walruses to go ashore in Alaska, rather than resting on sea ice to  take quick trips to feed.  This surely makes it hard for them to eat, and will therefore interfere with reproduction.  01 October 2014 (Hong Kong)  China's efforts to keep the public ignorant of protests in Hong Kong  show occasional slips. Nonetheless, we have found no way to defeat the tyranny of internet censorship, which has spread to many supposedly "free" countries including France and the UK.  01 October 2014 (Ebola) The US public health defenses that prevent an outbreak  of Ebola in the US.  The scandal is that extractivism and short-sightedness won't let Sierra Leone and Liberia have the medical systems necessary to prevent Ebola outbreaks there.   01 October 2014 ("Invisible Art") A hoax about a show of "invisible art"  satirizes the art world. The most bizarre part is that there really  is invisible "art".  01 October 2014 (Coal Burning) Modi's government plans a big increase in coal burning, and hopes that a parallel investment in renewable energy will distract from the fact that this pushes  human civilization closer to the invisible edge of the cliff.   01 October 2014 (Zero-Waste Restaurant)  A zero-waste (or else recycled materials)  restaurant in the UK.  01 October 2014 (Water Supply)  A US court declined to stop Detroit from continuing to shut off  poor residents' water supply.  Citizens plan to continue their resistance.  01 October 2014 (Pakistan)  Polio is resurging in Pakistan as a result of religious extremists  that fight against vaccination.   01 October 2014 (60 Students)  A gang of Mexican thugs killed and kidnaped around 60 students, perhaps because the thugs are  connected with a drug gang.  01 October 2014 (Abortions)   In Mexico (aside from one state), women are imprisoned for years for having abortions.  01 October 2014 (Privacy)  Outgoing  Attorney General Holder has joined the US government campaign against online privacy.  01 October 2014 (Aral Sea) The former Aral Sea dried up completely  this summer.  01 October 2014 (Military Equipment)  Many US thug departments want to return military equipment that the Pentagon says is "on loan" to them, but the Pentagon  won't take the equipment back.  01 October 2014 (Urgent: Mortgages)  US citizens: tell HUD to stop selling mortgages to wall street.  01 October 2014 (Urgent: Poultry inspections)  US citizens: call on the USDA to abandon its plan to let poultry companies do their own inspections.  Only a government working for the foxes would put them in charge of the hen house.  01 October 2014 (Non-plutocratic policies in Brazil)  Brazil's government has successfully given a larger fraction of GNP to the non-rich, lifting millions out of poverty, by adopting non-plutocratic policies.  01 October 2014 ("Open-plan" offices)  "Open-plan" offices appear to harm workers' health and productivity.  I wonder why businesses use them. The savings in rent can hardly be enough to be the reason.  01 October 2014 (Snooping on the entire internet)  The Australian spy agency can get permission to snoop on the entire internet by getting just one warrant.  01 October 2014 (Referendum on "blasphemy" in Ireland)  Ireland will have a referendum on abolishing the crime of "blasphemy".  30 September 2014 (Urgent: End sports tax exemption)  US citizens: support taking away tax exemption from professional sports leagues.  30 September 2014 (World Bank carbon offset plan)  A World Bank carbon offset plan involved kicking people off their lands so that a forest could grow.  This is a fundamental conflict, and human population growth makes it worse.  30 September 2014 (Growth of renewable energy)  The UK Conservatives are so embarrassed by the growth of renewable energy that they have decided not to report statistics on it.  They are in cahoots with fossil fuel and nuclear power companies, for which this growth is an inconvenient embarrassment.  30 September 2014 (Obama trying to cover up torture)  Obama is trying to cover up torture by holding Guantanamo torture hearings in secret.  30 September 2014 (Detroit's water shutoffs)  Detroit's water shutoffs for the poor have been approved by a plutocratic court.  30 September 2014 (Obama regime wants more nuclear weapons)  The Obama regime wants to spend lots of money making more plutonium cores for nuclear weapons. Never mind that the US has lots of extra ones in storage.  30 September 2014 (US hospitals in HMOs outsource ER doctors)  US hospitals in HMOs hire doctors in the emergency room who are not in the HMO &mdash; so that the doctors can gouge patients.  30 September 2014 (News coverage with CIA approval)  A former LA Times reporter, covering the CIA, showed his stories to the CIA to get approval of them.  30 September 2014 (Gitmo Hunger Strikes)  Gitmo Hunger Strikes Are a Cry for Help. Why Is the US Fighting Back with Secret Torture?  30 September 2014 (Apple may have to return tens of millions of euros)  Apple may have to return tens of millions of euros in illegal state funds to the Irish state.  30 September 2014 (The misogyny of ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel)  The misogyny of ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel spills over constantly to seating on airlines.  When it happens on airlines, it is funny, but in Israel it makes secular Jews think of emigrating. I don't think Arabs will destroy Israel (most of the governments no longer even say they want to). Orthodox theocracy will do it.  30 September 2014 (Nicaragua's planned canal)  Nicaragua's planned canal would destroy and pollute forests where endangered species live.  I have to wonder whether a railroad might do a better job. Now that containers make it quick and easy to load and unload ships, the time it takes to move cargo from ship to train is only a matter of how long a ship must wait to be unloaded. Building more port facilities can reduce that to any level.  A train line could carry the containers from one shore to the other faster than a ship could go through the canal. If one train line isn't enough, even ten parallel tracks would hurt the forest and the surrounding inhabitants less than a canal.  Animals can run across the tracks, but it would be easy to make bridges across the train lines since trains are much less tall than ships.  30 September 2014 (Occupy Central with Love & Peace (Hong Kong))  Press Release by Occupy Central with Love & Peace (Hong Kong).  Mass protests have succeeded in Hong Kong before.  30 September 2014 (Hottest ever recorded spring and summer)  Australia's hottest ever recorded spring and summer, a year ago, were 2000 times more likely due to the global heating that has occurred in recent decades.  30 September 2014 (Killing of John Crawford)  Comparing the video of the killing of John Crawford with what the thugs said had happened shows their story was false.  The thugs call that "testilying".  30 September 2014 (Sentenced to death for an underground abortion)  A nurse in Kenya has been sentenced to death for an underground abortion which went wrong, but Kenya's restrictive abortion law is the real killer.  30 September 2014 (Earth has lost half its wild animals since 40 years ago)  WWF estimates that Earth has lost half its wild animals since 40 years ago. They have been wiped out by human activity and its consequences.  I think the count refers to vertebrates only.  30 September 2014 (Urgent: End prison quota system)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to put an end to the quota system for keeping unauthorized immigrants in prison.  The quota system means that they always keep the prison full, and if there aren't enough unauthorized immigrants that there's a reason to imprison, they have to fill the bed with someone else that there is no reason to imprison. It's as wrong as giving thugs a daily quota for traffic tickets.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  30 September 2014 (Iran executes religious innovator)  Iran executed a religious innovator for "heresy".  For cover, other charges were listed with no evidence presented.  30 September 2014 (Changes in political views)  Old people change their political and ethical views as much as younger adults, and they tend to change in the direction of greater tolerance.  30 September 2014 (Australian uranium)  Is it right or wrong for Australia to mine and export uranium?  30 September 2014 (NDA for cell phone snooping devices)  The FCC requires local thug departments to sign a nondisclosure agreement with the FBI, as an excuse to keep the use of cell phone snooping devices secret.  The text of the NDA itself is also secret. Nice of them to at least admit that the contract is an NDA.  30 September 2014 (Racism in the US)  Racism in the US is more pervasive than even black Americans realize.  30 September 2014 (Private sex lives none of our business)  So [Tory Minister] Brooks Newmark Sent Some Explicit Pictures &mdash; Why Should He Resign?  I am glad to see prominent rejection of the absurdly exaggerated importance given to politician's private sex lives. The same foolish idea was the basis for impeaching President Clinton.  That Tory minister is not fit to be in office because he's on the plutocratic side. The same was true of Clinton. Their sex lives were none of our business and not relevant at all.  30 September 2014 (Russia wants social media data)  Russia will block access to Facebook, Twitter and Google unless they register and keep all data on Russian users in Russia.  That policy would make the users safer (perhaps) from NSA spying but more vulnerable to spying by the ex-KGB. For people in Russia, the Russian state is much more of a threat than the American state, so this law oppresses them.  By contrast, the European Union has better data protection law than the US, so requiring European users' data to be kept in Europe is an improvement in their privacy.  However, that improvement will only fully take effect if the EU prevents the US from subpoena'ing user data that subsidiaries of US companies keep in Europe.  30 September 2014 (Hong Kong protests)  Hong Kong Surprises Itself with the Exuberance And Spontaneity of Protests.  Thugs were unable to shut the protests down.  So the government withdrew the thugs.  30 September 2014 (Protesters block Israeli ship in California)  Protesters have again blocked an Israeli ship from unloading cargo in the port of Oakland.  30 September 2014 (Syrian al Qa'ida affiliate joins PISSI)  The al Qa'ida affiliate in Syria has joined up with PISSI (the pseudo-Islamic state). This will simplify Obama's argument that Congressional authorization for war against al Qa'ida covers fighting PISSI.  Fighting PISSI might offer a path towards ending the fighting between Assad and the other Syrian rebels.  29 September 2014 (PISSI)  What to call the theocratic state in Syria and Iraq? Calling it the "Islamic State" endorses their claim to represent Islam. That's dubious, since most Muslims say otherwise; it also plays into their hands.  Since it stands for a twisted and distorted version of Islam, it is really a pseudo-Islamic state. Thus, I propose PISSI, for Pseudo-Islamic State of Syria and Iraq.  29 September 2014 (Trusting Apple?)  Can we trust Apple's improved support for users' privacy?  29 September 2014 (Ignoring global heating)  Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore [Global Heating] And What To Do about It.  29 September 2014 (Remote car shutoff devices)  Car loans in the US now come with remote control car shutoff devices.  I don't think this should be allowed.  29 September 2014 (ACLU suing Oklahoma thugs)  The ACLU is suing Oklahoma thugs over their private network for keeping records on lots of citizens.  29 September 2014 (UK repeats mistake by fighting ISIS)  A member of B'liar's cabinet says that the UK, by fighting ISIS, is repeating the mistake he made.  29 September 2014 (Ferguson thug chief's apology)  The Ferguson thug chief apologized for a secondary detail of the killing of Michael Brown. His apology has not been accepted.  29 September 2014 (Man tortured to death by Taliban)  The Taliban captured a visiting Afghan-Australian and tortured him to death, apparently just because of his ethnic group.  29 September 2014 (New solar electricity generators)  A new invention uses 80% of incoming sunlight to generate electricity and desalinate water.  29 September 2014 (Bullies obstruct free expression)  What Price Artistic Freedom When the Bullies Turn Up?  29 September 2014 (What ISIS may gain from air strikes)  "What the Isis jihadis lose in strength from the air strikes they may gain in legitimacy".  29 September 2014 (Urgent: Take action for real net neutrality)  US citizens: call on Obama to take action for real net neutrality.  29 September 2014 (Retirement benefits)  The Washington Post recommends governments cut retirement benefits for government employees, so Bezos (its new owner) decided to do this to the staff of the Washington Post.  29 September 2014 (Veterans of the Bush forces suing)  Veterans of the Bush forces are suing to get precise information about where DU (dirty uranium) weapons were used, to gauge whether they were exposed to this carcinogen.  29 September 2014 (Urgent: No Federal Contracts for Corporate Deserters Act)  US citizens: support the No Federal Contracts for Corporate Deserters Act.  28 September 2014 (Modi went to New York)  Indian Prime Minister Modi went to New York for a triumph but encountered a lawsuit from victims of the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat that he is suspected of encouraging.  28 September 2014 (Commercial photography banned in federal wildlife)  The US Forest Service claims to have banned commercial photography (including for journalism) in federal wildlife areas.  28 September 2014 (Prison employee raped by a prisoner)  A Pennsylvania prison employee was raped by a prisoner, and the state claimed in court that it was the employee's fault.  28 September 2014 (Urgent: Phone Walmart)  Everyone: phone Walmart at 1-800-WALMART to tell that company to give Thelma Moore her job back. She was fired for being injured while pregnant.  28 September 2014 (Proposed European Commissioner for the environment)  The proposed European Commissioner for the environment seems to be tied to Malta's policy allowing mass shooting of migrating birds, and people suspect his choice was part of a larger plan to sabotage EU environmental protection.  28 September 2014 (Effects of global heating)  Effects of global heating are causing damage around the world, even though it is just the beginning.  If you are young and in the US, you may become an environmental refugee later in this century.  28 September 2014 (Privately run NHS hospital neglecting patients)  The one privately run NHS hospital in Britain has been neglecting patients.  Why am I not surprised?  28 September 2014 (Collective punishment)  An in-depth study shows that a feeling of being subject to collective punishment is a primary ingredient in the making of a terrorist fanatic.  28 September 2014 (Head of FBI condemned tech companies)  The head of the FBI condemned tech companies that have improved security against massive surveillance, saying they are helping people "place themselves beyond the law".  That's a falsehood; people have no legal obligation to open their window shades to help the FBI spy on their private lives. It is the US spy agencies that have placed itself "beyond the law".  28 September 2014 (African palm oil)  Will African palm oil be produced by local farmers or by corporate plantations?  28 September 2014 (Urgent: New attorney general)  US citizens: call on Obama to choose a new attorney general that will stop the cruelty of the War on Drugs.  28 September 2014 (Urgent: Google funding politicians that deny global heating)  Everyone: call on Google to stop funding politicians that deny global heating.  Here's info on how Google funds them (and other companies too).  28 September 2014 (Urgent: Stop supporting ALEC)  Everyone: Phone Ebay and call on that company to stop supporting ALEC.  ALEC pushes plutocratic laws at the state level in the US.  28 September 2014 (Why The Islamic State Is Not Islamic)  Why The Islamic State Is Not Islamic.  I am thinking about using another name for it; perhaps Da'esh.  28 September 2014 (Sham "peace negotiations")  Abbas, speaking to the UN, condemned the US-sponsored sham "peace negotiations" and said that any new negotiations must be aimed at creating an independent Palestine.  28 September 2014 (Different way to deal with ISIS)  Groups that campaign for peace generally oppose Obama's new war in Iraq and Syria. They recommend a different way to deal with ISIS.  I support providing air support to the armies fighting ISIS armies. I've explained why that is urgently needed, and less likely to result in civilian casualties.  Aside from that, I agree with the peace groups.  28 September 2014 (Housing: a Political Problem)  Housing: How Many Have to Be Unable to Afford It Before It Becomes a Political Problem?  28 September 2014 (Expanding use of natural gas)  Expanding use of natural gas in the US will increase future carbon emissions.  28 September 2014 (Soft on criminal big business)  Attorney General Holder has made a habit of going soft on criminal big business.  27 September 2014 (Voluntary cooperation)  Psychology explains how Burning Man creates a high level of voluntary cooperation.  The word "market" means buying and selling. To use that word to refer to altruistic cooperation is an abuse of language; I am not going to use the word that way.  27 September 2014 (Australia's new ban on journalism)  Australia's new ban on journalism will imprison journalists and their sources.  If it had been in effect two years ago, articles we have read about Australia's spying would have led to imprisonment of the authors.  27 September 2014 (Uzbek political prisoners)  Uzbekistan holds thousands of political prisoners.  27 September 2014 (How biometric ID in the US began)  Biometric ID in the US began as a scheme to stop slaves from escaping.  27 September 2014 (Thugs acting fast)  The thugs that killed John Crawford had recently seen a video encouraging them to act fast against people who are shooting other people.  Great work, except that they didn't stop to find that out that John Crawford was not shooting anyone.  27 September 2014 (Facebook rats)  Julian Assange: 'When you post to Facebook, you're being a rat.'  I've stated the same point in my speeches for a few years, asking people not to post photos of me to Facebook and explaining why.  27 September 2014 (Marijuana legalization campaign in Alaska)  Charlo Greene's boosted the marijuana legalization campaign in Alaska by quitting her TV job on the air.  27 September 2014 (The CIA-cocaine scandal story)  The CIA helped a few major US newspapers nitpick the CIA-cocaine scandal story to death.  It seems unlikely that the people in charge of each of those newspapers ordered the major biased efforts spontaneously. It must have been coordinated somehow. Since these CIA documents don't show how, it remains to be investigated.  27 September 2014 (Turkey blocks Syrian border)  Turkey has started blocking the smuggling of oil from ISIS in Syria, but it is also blocking refugees from leaving that part of Syria.  27 September 2014 (Urgent: Limit US war in Iraq and Syria)  US citizens: sign this petition for Congress to limit US war in Iraq and Syria, regarding both time and methods.  27 September 2014 (Minimum wage)  Los Angeles legislated a $15/hr minimum wage for hotel workers in large hotels.  If some hotels move to nearby towns, that will show the whole region ought to have a higher minimum wage.  27 September 2014 (Cambodia unfit to take refugees)  Cambodian protesters say Cambodia doesn't respect human rights enough to be a fit place to send refugees who went to Australia.  27 September 2014 (UK cuts in legal aid)  UK cuts in legal aid are supposedly meant to save money, but they won't do much of that; rather they will deny justice to the non-rich.  27 September 2014 (Liberian food production crippled)  The reaction to Ebola is crippling food production in Liberia.  27 September 2014 (No plan for winning war against ISIS)  The West Has No Plan for Winning the War against Isis &mdash; Only Avoiding Defeat.  27 September 2014 (Indonesia abolishes direct presidential elections)  Indonesia's lame duck parliament voted to abolish direct presidential elections &mdash; which seem to offer too much democracy.  27 September 2014 (Australians protest for renewable energy)  Australians held 30 protests to keep the existing target for renewable energy.  26 September 2014 (US attack on ISIS oil wells)  The US attacked ISIS oil wells and refineries to cut off its funding.  It seems like an intelligent way to damage ISIS, but it risks causing horrible pollution.  26 September 2014 (Pseudoscience in UK schools)  UK schools teach creationist pseudoscience and some universities recognize it academically.  26 September 2014 (EU research on oil spill containment)  A large EU research project for containing oil spills from undersea oil wells has the stated goal of encouraging public support for such wells.  Research on containing spills is a valid goal; risking the spills is not.  26 September 2014 (Germany's genocide in Namibia)  Germany's first 20th century genocide, in Namibia, trained many of the people who carried out Nazi genocide.  26 September 2014 (US high school dress rules)  Students in many US high schools protested the dress rules imposed on girls by the American Taliban, and the nasty punishments used to enforce them.  26 September 2014 (US beer market)  One giant beer conglomerate controls half the US market. Four companies control almost 80%.  That's about as bad as the ISP market, the book publishing market, and the recorded music market.  I think we should take whatever steps are needed so that no company, unless it is a regulated monopoly, controls more than 5% of any field.  27 September 2014 (Cal students under control)  50 years ago, students at UC Berkeley defeated an attempt to control them with censorship. Today, under plutocratic rule, students are controlled with debt they can't pay, because the plutocrats got out of paying taxes.  26 September 2014 (Attacking without UN authorization)  Attacking ISIS in Syria, without authorization from the UN Security Council, violates the treaties that created the UN, and Obama's argument that it is Iraq's right of self-defense is invalid.  If it were valid, it would equally well authorize Assad to bomb Turkey.  The ethical argument that convinces me it is right to bomb ISIS forces in the field as they try to conquer cities and big dams is that we must protect those people from horrible oppression including mass murder. I don't know how that plays out against the UN charter, but that's not the argument Obama made.  26 September 2014 (Urgent: Protest unfair trade treaties)  In Europe: join protests on Oct 11 against unfair trade treaties.  26 September 2014 (Rare bits of nature to be destroyed)  A hill in England that hosts old trees, nightingales and rare butterflies is slated for building; all those things will be lost.  The UK urgently needs more council housing, but that does not require destroying rare bits of nature. It is much better to replace low-density housing near train stations with apartment buildings.  26 September 2014 (Painful experiences)  Advice to distance yourself from painful experiences, not rehearse them as a grievance.  If the painful experience was an injustice, the one feeling you shouldn't try to weaken is your support for others to whom such an injustice happens.  26 September 2014 (Protection of wolves in Wyoming)  The few remaining wolves in Wyoming are once again protected.  Protection enabled wolves to recover, but some states don't like that, and seek to use the successful recovery of the species as an excuse to wipe it out again.  26 September 2014 (Iraqi military a total disaster)  $26 Billion in US Aid Later, the Iraqi Military Is a Total Disaster.  26 September 2014 (Briton charged with blasphemy in Pakistan)  A Briton in Pakistan, who has been charged with blasphemy, survived an assassination attempt by a thug.  This law is why I refuse to visit Pakistan.  I recommend that the US and other countries require all visitors to make a public pledge in support of freedom of speech (which would include condemning laws against "blasphemy") before allowing them to enter.  Pakistan is not the only country that unjustly punishes "blasphemy". In India, web sites can be forcibly shut down if they "offend" any religion. And the  Maldive Islands have imposed censorship on book publishing as part of Muslim extremism.  26 September 2014 (Sierra Leone imposes quarantines)  Sierra Leone has imposed quarantines on large zones containing more than 1/3 of the population.  I am skeptical that this will be effective for stopping the spread of Ebola. Surely there are infected people in each of the zones that the country is now divided into.  26 September 2014 (Unity Gov't control of Gaza)  Fatah and Hamas Agree Deal for Unity Government to Take Control of Gaza.  26 September 2014 (ISIS)  Both the US and Iran have their blind spots when talking about ISIS.  26 September 2014 (California thug agrees to resign)  A thug that punched a woman in California with no grounds has agreed to resign.  Good, but he should be prosecuted.  26 September 2014 (Coal train protest)  A coal train protester says ending coal shipments is the government's job, but since it failed to do its job, the responsibility fell to him.  26 September 2014 (Disrupting military drone manufacturing)  Scottish protesters shut down a factory making components for Israeli military drones.  26 September 2014 (Seattle bans neonicotinoid pesticides)  Seattle has banned neonicotinoid pesticides in the city.  It also will fine people that don't do composting. I am not sure how this is supposed to work for people that live in apartments and have no gardens.  26 September 2014 (US politicians want to cancel citizenships)  US politicians want to cancel the citizenship of people that support ISIS.  There are crimes that we have good reason to punish, some by life imprisonment, but denial of citizenship is never legitimate. (It also violates treaties to make someone stateless.)  Sad to say, the US has a history of revoking citizenship of immigrants for political reasons. For instance, Emma Goldman's US citizenship was revoked because of her political activities: draft resistance and birth control.  26 September 2014 (Repression of gays in Egypt)  Egypt is systematically repressing gays (extralegally) after a video was posted of an unofficial wedding of two men.  26 September 2014 (Prosecution of Romanian prison commander)  In Romania, the commander of a prison under Ceausescu is being prosecuted.  When will the US prosecute people who presided over torture in Guantanamo?  26 September 2014 (Facebook's "real name" policy)  Facebook with its "real name" policy makes itself the arbiter of other people's selves.  26 September 2014 (Students in Colorado protest)  Students in Colorado walked out and protested a right-wing plan for one-sided education in obeying authority.  26 September 2014 (UK to phase out old coal power plants)  Cameron says the UK plans to phase out old coal power plants over the next 15 years, but does not make a clear commitment to replace them with safe renewable power.  26 September 2014 (Human rights NGOs threatened)  Egyptian "president" al-Sisi has made a decree that threatens human rights NGOs with prosecution.  26 September 2014 (Perverse redefinitions of common terms)  What Obama says about fighting in Iraq is misleading due to perverse redefinitions of common terms such as "imminent attack", "civilians", militants" and "ground troops".  26 September 2014 (New Zealand election)  The pro-business party in New Zealand won reelection through a long-term organized practice of smearing opponents through proxies.  26 September 2014 (Spread of Ebola)  Over a million people could be infected with Ebola virus by January if it keeps spreading at the current rate.  26 September 2014 (UK's deportation of Tamil refugees)  Sri Lanka continues to torture Tamils regularly, often demanding information about Tamil refugees in the UK. Meanwhile, the UK continues deporting those refugees to Sri Lanka.  This is prima facie evidence that the UK minister in charge of deportations is callously blind to justice, law and humanity.  26 September 2014 (Obama's speech about global heating)  Bill McKibben critiques Obama's speech about global heating.  26 September 2014 (Urgent: Strict limits on shipping oil on trains)  US citizens: call for strict limits on shipping oil on trains.  26 September 2014 (Urgent: Make commitments for renewable energy)  Everyone: call on Amazon to make commitments for renewable energy.  26 September 2014 (Painful reality of poverty)  Talking about "inequality" covers up the painful reality of poverty.  26 September 2014 (Jailed for a year without charges or lawyers)  The ACLU is suing to free people that Mississippi jailed for as much as a year without charges or lawyers.  26 September 2014 (Massive and broad attack on Australians' freedom)  Australia's government is using far-away ISIS as an excuse for a massive and broad attack on Australians' freedom, including imprisonment of reporters and whistleblowers, massive surveillance, and punishment without trial.  ISIS is a horrible threat to people in Iraq and Syria; for Australia, the danger of ISIS is a pinprick compared with this.  26 September 2014 (John Crawford was not threatening anyone)  Walmart's security camera shows that John Crawford was not threatening anyone, bothering anyone, or pointing the BB rifle at anyone when thugs shot him. He was standing still, talking on his phone.  A passerby told the thugs that Crawford was pointing the BB rifle at people, and the thugs who killed Crawford falsely repeated that claim, but they shot him without taking a couple of seconds of care to check it.  If thugs can get away with this sort of excuse, nobody is safe. However, whites are in less danger than blacks: people are less likely to falsely perceive whites as threatening others, and thugs are less likely to shoot whites before asking questions.  26 September 2014 (Plutocratic extremists in US)  Plutocratic extremists in the US want to set retired people and children against each other, hoping parents will blame the retired and fight them for the dwindling share of the nation's production that plutocrats allow to everyone else.  26 September 2014 (Urgent: Stop trying to patent mutant human genes)  Everyone: call on Myriad Genetics to stop trying to patent mutant human genes.  Of course, what is really needed is a law to eliminate all such patents in Australia, that's no reason not to pressure the companies that try to exploit the existing bad law.  26 September 2014 (Palo Alto's electricity)  Palo Alto's electricity is carbon-neutral, and cheap compared with the rest of California.  However, that doesn't include the cars; there is still a long way to go.  26 September 2014 (Thugs will not be prosecuted)  The thugs that shot John Crawford, while he carried a BB-gun he was about to buy, will not be prosecuted.  The US legal system, through a combination of its official rules and its unstated prejudices, empowers thugs to shoot innocent black men from time to time, and to harass them continually.  26 September 2014 (Israeli crime)  Kidnaping and killing three Israeli teenagers was a horrible crime, by every day standards, but Israel used it as an excuse to commit a crime 400 times as big.  26 September 2014 (Privacy research)  Google gave money to Stanford for research, but made Stanford accept the condition not to use it to fund privacy research.  [later] It seems the original report was based on a misunderstanding; everyone now says there was no such restriction.  26 September 2014 (Marine reserves in the Pacific)  The US and Kiribati will create vast marine reserves in the Pacific.  25 September 2014 (Protesters block UK coal train)  Greenpeace protesters in the UK blocked a coal train and packed the coal into bags saying to return it to Putin.  25 September 2014 (Mass protest in Tokyo)  A mass protest in Tokyo against restarting nuclear power plants.  25 September 2014 ("Plagiarism" of policy proposals)  Two Republican legislators criticized a Democratic candidate for "plagiarizing" part of the text of a policy proposal. The same two Republicans did not hesitate to copy a nasty ALEC model bill and present it as their own work.  The concept of plagiarism is not applicable to policy proposals and laws. It would be total folly to refrain from advocating a good policy just because someone else has advocated it before.  25 September 2014 (Science and political issues)  Scientists must resist the idea that science is above politics and that they ought to be apolitical.  Today, several areas of science tie directly to the most important political issues of our age, including global heating, privacy, and toxic agricultural practices.  25 September 2014 (Attempt to hold torturers responsible)  Trying again to hold British soldiers in the Bush forces responsible for torture carried out in cahoots with the US government.  25 September 2014 (Metaphors and global heating)  Taking metaphors seriously is no way to understand an important issue such as global heating.  25 September 2014 (Fines issued by thug in rage)  A thug in Seattle expressed his hostility to another official by giving 80 people fines for smoking marijuana, apparently illegally.  25 September 2014 (China promises cap on greenhouse gas)  China pledged to publish soon a schedule for capping and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  If China goes through with this, the US had better do it too.  Most of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the US, and India.  25 September 2014 (Tasmania's proposed anti-protest laws)  Tasmania's proposed law, meant to crush protests against logging, will exclude places such as stores and public areas. But it will still be aimed at forests, factories, and farms, so it is still unacceptable.  25 September 2014 (Australia's plans for asylum seekers)  Australia is trying to make asylum seekers go to Papua New Guinea, including some who are gay &mdash; but they would be persecuted there.  It plans to force them to Cambodia instead.  25 September 2014 (Turkey to fight ISIS)  Turkey will participate in fighting ISIS.  This support is clearly useful, but even though Turkey's government is not as bad as Saudi Arabia's or Bahrain's or Qatar's, it is still Islamist and an enemy of human rights.  25 September 2014 (Duck Duck Go gains prestige)  China awarded Duck Duck Go its most prestigious internet medal: censorship.  25 September 2014 (UK children retarded by poverty)  Plutocrat-imposed poverty in the UK shows up in children: half the children of the age to start school are not mentally developed enough. Their parents are too short of money to do what the children need.  The Tory Party has condemned those children to a life of backwardness, but Labour says it will make only marginal improvements.  25 September 2014 (Right-wing donations laundered)  Dinesh D'Souza confessed to laundering donations for right-wing political campaigns.  25 September 2014 (US airstrikes in Raqqa)  Interviews with civilians in Raqqa about the US airstrikes there.  25 September 2014 (Spain's right-wing gov't)  Spain's right-wing government has given up on attacking abortion rights.  However, it has already made a large fraction of Spaniards poor, and attacked the right to protest.  25 September 2014 (Unemployment in Italy)  An Italian town's last-ditch effort to help the unemployed people is to give some of them funds to try to emigrate.  24 September 2014 (Israeli soldiers kill suspects)  Israeli soldiers found the two Palestinians that were suspected of kidnaping and murdering three Israeli teenagers, and killed them.  Why weren't they arrested instead? Maybe they fought and made it impossible to arrest them. Or maybe the Israelis preferred to kill them.  24 September 2014 (US allied with vicious regimes)  The US is now allied with Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, in fighting in Syria.  It makes strategic sense to ally with Sunni monarchies to undermine the claims of ISIS to the loyalty of Sunnis. But I can't understand how anyone can be "proud to stand shoulder to shoulder" with these vicious regimes. Saudi Arabia beheads people regularly, and oppresses women almost as badly as ISIS does. As for Bahrain, remember the protests and the massacres?  24 September 2014 (Google breaks with ALEC)  Google has broken with ALEC.  Being willing to work with ALEC even over some other issue suggests a moral blindness.  24 September 2014 (US air strikes against ISIS)  The US started air strikes against ISIS in Syria, including in the city of Raqaa, with cooperation from Jordan.  An announcement on CNN said, "A military official said the strikes are meant to target the ability of the terror group to command and control, resupply and train." There is nothing wrong with those goals in principle, but this means the attacks are not against troops in the field &mdash; and therefore are likely to kill civilians.  If the people living in Raqaa resent ISIS and wish they could kick ISIS out, they will welcome these attacks; if some of them are killed, they will consider that a necessary evil and blame ISIS. But if they don't resent ISIS, they will blame the US for those deaths, and give ISIS more support.  24 September 2014 (The "tax inversion" loophole)  Obama says administrative measures will close the "tax inversion" loophole.  It will be good to shut it this way, but that ought to be firmed up in law.  24 September 2014 (The spying-industrial complex)  The spying-industrial complex: 5 companies that get contracts from US intelligence agencies and continually exaggerate the danger of terrorism.  Terrorists do exist, but the threat they pose to Americans is minute compared with the danger of cars, smoking, and the plutocratic regime that leaves tens of millions of Americans with no health care except the emergency room.  Terrorism hype is striking Australia too, and being used as the excuse to attack civil liberties there.  24 September 2014 (Harassment of US journalists)  The Committee to Protect Journalists rebuked the Obama regime again for its harassment and prosecution of journalists.  24 September 2014 (400,000 people march in NYC)  400,000 people joined in the climate march in New York City.  This was followed by the Flood Wall Street protest. The protesters couldn't get inside the stock exchanges, but pointed out that the ocean will get in, unless we stop the global heating that raises sea level.  24 September 2014 (Private US college tuition)  Private US colleges are demanding more money from poor families while offering scholarships to the wealthy.  24 September 2014 (Hong Kong students protest)  Hong Kong students have called a week of strikes to demand democratic elections.  24 September 2014 (Australia cutting intel budget)  Australia has been cutting the budget for intelligence agencies. Proposed attacks on human rights are apparently meant to compensate for that.  23 September 2014 (Effects of global heating on the poor)  Coping with the effects of global heating is leaving some poor countries short of funds for health care and education.  23 September 2014 (Employment)  Extending unemployment benefits has no effect on when or whether people get back to work. But it sure helps them avoid living in the street unless/until they get work again.  What does help get people work is government spending directed in ways that create a lot of jobs &mdash; not spending on banks or weapons. For instance, unemployment benefits feed money into the economy, and the recipients are sure to spend it right away on job-creating activities.  Almost 40% of potentially employed people in the US are not working, because there aren't jobs for them. Most of them are in some degree of hardship. Automation is likely to make this a lot worse.  The solution is a basic income for everyone.  24 September 2014 (Courageous Australian MP)  A courageous Australian MP calls for former prime minister Howard to be prosecuted by the ICC for starting a war based on lies.  Hear, hear!  24 September 2014 (Ban on Fracking)  The Urgent Case for a Ban on Fracking.  24 September 2014 (Republicans blocking voter registrations)  Republicans in Georgia are blocking 51,000 voter registrations, apparently because they are from minority groups.  24 September 2014 ("Preventative detention")  Australia has ordered some sort of "preventative detention" for people associated in some way with an alleged terror plot. Everyone is forbidden to publish any information about what is going on, including (it appears) the names of the people imprisoned.  Are those people's friends talking about their absence?  24 September 2014 (UK may sneak secretly into a ground war in Iraq)  The UK may sneak secretly into a ground war in Iraq using commando groups, while imposing new secrecy rules to thwart democracy.  24 September 2014 (Global economy needs to cut its carbon intensity)  The global economy needs to cut its carbon intensity by 6% per year from now till 2100 to avoid more than 2 degrees of heating.  And that's assuming good luck, that we don't hit an unexpected positive feedback that sends heating shooting ahead.  24 September 2014 (Exports of fossil fuels and uranium)  Australia's government plans to increase exports of fossil fuels and uranium, effectively aiming to push the rest of the world to cause global heating disaster.  24 September 2014 (Western Australia killed an aboriginal woman)  Western Australia killed an aboriginal woman by jailing her for unpaid parking tickets and denying her medical care.  24 September 2014 (Queensland returning land to aboriginal traditional owners)  Queensland is returning 20,000 square km of land to aboriginal traditional owners.  Europeans took the land of Australia from the aboriginal peoples, and it is right to give some of it back.  However, I do not approve of the aboriginal culture's idea that major aspects of that culture, its laws in effect, should be the property of small groups. Secret law is not law. It does far more harm in Obama's hands, or the Australian government's hands, than in the aboriginal people's hands, because the latter have comparatively little power. It is wrong in principle nonetheless.  24 September 2014 (Single mothers occupied boarded-up building)  29 single mothers, made homeless by the UK's crush-the-poor policies and threatened with being sent 200 miles away, have occupied a boarded-up building in their town.  24 September 2014 (Life in prison for publishing political views)  China sentenced Ilham Tohti to life in prison for publishing political views.  The US is not in a position to sneer at China, given what it continues to do in Guantanamo.  24 September 2014 (ISIS released video)  ISIS released a video calling on supporters to kill non-Muslims in Australia, Canada, Europe and the US.  It is a valid point that this video shows ISIS does not have the power to carry out such attacks itself.  A more important point becomes visible when we consider why ISIS made this statement. They can't help knowing that it will inflame war-fever in those countries, so that must be their aim. They must want those countries to engage in an overt war that will boost support for ISIS among the people it rules. They are telling us, enemies they can barely touch, to "come out and fight like a man" so they can profit from that mistake.  One Australian politician questions the logic of trying to destroy ISIS by war. "We must curb our instinctive reaction and look at the root causes."  Jordan's participation in the attack on ISIS in Syria was a good move for Obama, since it will undermine ISIS's message to Sunnis.  23 September 2014 (Home of the brave)  The thug who accosted Danielle Watts had no legal basis to do so, and he handcuffed for calmly exercising the legal rights everyone is supposed to have in the US.  Three cheers for Danielle Watts!  23 September 2014 (Walmart dumps cost of uniforms on workers)  Walmart is dumping the cost of new uniforms on its workers by calling the uniforms a "dress code".  23 September 2014 (Thug tases teenage driver)  A thug tased a teenage driver, apparently because the car's electric window on the passenger side did not open. Dragged out of the car, the driver's head seems to have hit the ground, causing a grave brain injury.  This is unremarkable in the US, but this teenager was not a mere citizen. He was the son of another thug. So shit is hitting the fan.  I hope that kid gets justice, but it won't be a lot of justice if it applies only when the victim is the child of a thug.  23 September 2014 (After Scotland's vote)  After Scotland almost voted to exit the UK, will that be enough to convert the timid Labour Party into something ready to fix what is wrong?  23 September 2014 (Rockefellers to divest from fossil fuel)  The Rockefeller Brothers Fund pledged to divest from fossil fuel.  In addition to punishing fossil fuel companies' stock price &mdash; which could be cancelled out if other investors buy in &mdash; the divestment movement can concentrate plutocratic lobbying power in favor of decarbonization. Plutocratic lobbying power is an injustice, and to restore democracy we must get rid of it, but in the mean time setting some of it against global heating is a step forward.  23 September 2014 (Surrendering France to plutocrats)  The French government, under the Socialist Party, plans to make France "more competitive". That's the code word for "surrender to the plutocrats."  23 September 2014 (Militarization of US thugs)  The Pentagon gives military weapons even to thug departments that the US government considers likely to violate people's rights. It is a mistake to suppose that the other thug departments won't do this. Hardly any of them should get military weapons.  The existence of a SWAT team impels rules to use it frequently, and that use puts people's lives in danger. The US needs 20 SWAT teams in cities distributed around the country; more than that is an avoidable risk.  23 September 2014 (Bearers of economic risks)  Why Ordinary People Bear Economic Risks and Donald Trump Doesn't.  23 September 2014 (India's attack against Greenpeace)  India denied entry to a Greenpeace official, as part of a broad attack against Greenpeace.  The Modi government is turning out to be an even greater sellout to business than the Congress Party was.  23 September 2014 (Evidence that Darrien Hunt was cosplaying)  There is evidence suggesting Darrien Hunt was cosplaying when thugs shot him.  23 September 2014 (Ocean acidification)  Human CO2 emissions, by acidifying the oceans, are reducing the ocean's ability to absorb CO2. This means more of the emissions will go into the atmosphere and global heating will speed up.  23 September 2014 (Sports teams bully US cities)  Arrogant sports teams bully US cities into funding stadiums for them, promising the cities economic growth &mdash; which benefits only a few, if it happens at all.  23 September 2014 (Futon Physics)  A humorous article, Futon Physics  22 September 2014 (Italian Puns)  New puns in Italian   22 September 2014 (Right of first sale)  Congress is considering a bill to allow resale of devices that contain software covered by EULAs.  This is a first step in the right direction. The right of first sale should trump all EULAs, and so should personal modification.  The article refers to DRM (digital restrictions management) by the unfortunate term "digital locks". This grants them legitimacy by comparing them to ordinary locks. Please criticize that term when you see it.  22 September 2014 (March for the Climate)  While We March for the Climate, Governments Meet with Polluters.  22 September 2014 (Uber drivers getting shafted)  Uber drivers are getting shafted; Uber can arbitrarily cut their pay, and they have to work 15 hours a day. Some are trying to unionize.  Uber requires running nonfree software, too; if you value your freedom, you won't consider Uber an option.  We should not accept the whitewash label of "sharing economy" for companies like Uber. A more accurate term is "piecework subcontractor economy".  22 September 2014 (University divestment from fossil fuels)  The University of Dayton has decided to divest from fossil fuels and invest some of those funds in green energy.  22 September 2014 (Folly of school "lockdown" drills)  The folly of repeated "lockdown" drills in US schools.  22 September 2014 (Thousands protested in Moscow)  Thousands protested in Moscow against aggression in Ukraine.  22 September 2014 (Only in US would people propose this law)  Only in the US would people propose a law to punish parents simply because their teenage children commit crimes.  22 September 2014 (Failing completely to reduce CO2 emissions)  Humanity is failing completely to reduce CO2 emissions; they are headed for a record this year.  22 September 2014 (Afghanistan was unable to conclude an election)  Afghanistan was unable to conclude an election to choose between two candidates for president, so eventually the two leading candidates made a power-sharing deal.  It does not betoken a government with sufficient unity and strength to fight the Taliban.  22 September 2014 (Fighting fossil fuels)  Desmond Tutu calls for fighting fossil fuels with the tactics used to fight apartheid, including boycotting anything sponsored by fossil fuel companies.  22 September 2014 (Secret prison in Afghanistan)  The US handed over some Pakistani prisoners from its secret prison in Afghanistan to prison in Pakistan.  This Bagram prison is even nastier than Guantanamo; the prisoners have been brought there from around the world, can't even see a lawyer, and the US won't even say who is imprisoned there. In effect, they have been disappeared.  No matter what those men did, or are accused (perhaps spuriously) of doing, it can't justify this.  22 September 2014 (A wave of assassinations)  Libyan Islamists appear to be behind a wave of assassinations of non-Islamists in Benghazi.  21 September 2014 (Ebola virus)  In the horrible world where Ebola virus spreads, anyone who comes near you could kill you.  If we stop the spread of Ebola reasonably soon, the long-term population growth will be unaffected. Having "neighbourhood festivities" when a baby is born might be partly responsible for the dangerously high growth rate. We need to do something about that.  21 September 2014 (The "privatization" of Britain)  How the "privatization" of Britain replaced government services with foreign-controlled monopolies.  21 September 2014 (Poor people can barely cope)  Why poor people eat junk food and smoke, and can't make long-term plans that would improve their circumstances: they can barely cope with each week.  Being sleepy all the time makes it harder for people to plan well. When the system imposes that on people, it's the system that must be changed. However, discouragement plays a role too. It is hard to summon up attention for long-term dangers when you know you can't protect yourself from the immediate dangers.  This shows that the US needs to undo the plutocratic changes since 1980, so as to make most people's lives no worse than they were then.  However, it also shows the importance of helping the poor in ways that don't require them to make plans, choose carefully among options, and apply for support. Because they don't have the time for that on top of their daily obligations.  When a woman who did not want to get pregnant has an abortion, it means the system failed to give her the means to avoid pregnancy and she is correcting that failure.  We should help poor women avoid pregnancy by having high school steer students into effective modern birth control, such as implants or IUDs. The state should pay for these, for all women. To refuse is stupid penny-pinching.  If you want to buy Ms Tirado's book, please don't order it, especially not from Amazon. Buy it with anonymous cash in a local independent book store.  21 September 2014 (Fingerprinting students)  UK schools have taken the fingerprints of a million students as if it were nothing.  21 September 2014 (Google)  Assange: Google is effectively the private equivalent of the NSA.  21 September 2014 (Global heating denial)  Global heating's effects are all around us, but powerful plutocrats suppress recognition of global heating in the US (and Canada, Australia and the UK). So US cities that want to plan to cope with the consequences expected in the next few decades have to tiptoe around the cause.  21 September 2014 (US massive surveillance programs)  The CDT and ACLU reported 5 US massive surveillance programs to the UN as especially threatening to human rights.  21 September 2014 (Paranoia in Australia)  Paranoia in Australia: a passenger was kicked off a flight because someone saw him scribbling in a notebook about the fear of terrorism.  This sort of paranoia helps governments attack human rights, which does far more damage than terrorists ever could.  21 September 2014 (Obama to "forward-deploy" some "advisers")  Obama says he won't send ground troops to fight in Iraq, but instead will "forward-deploy" some of the "advisers". In practice, it may be the same thing.  There may be some advantage in this disguise; until ISIS kills some on the battlefield, the US could claim not to have troops fighting in Iraq, much as Putin pretended not to have Russian troops fighting in Ukraine.  21 September 2014 (US thugs waiting to rob Canadians)  Warning to Canadians: in the US, thugs are waiting to rob you.  21 September 2014 (Artificial sweeteners)  A study gives a preliminary suggestion that common artificial sweeteners can affect intestinal bacteria in some people, causing them to experience high blood sugar levels.  21 September 2014 (Antibiotic resistance)  The proposed US law to prevent antibiotic resistance won't help; it will make the system worse.  21 September 2014 (Wars of Choice)  Ralph Nader: Damaging Our Country from Wars of Choice.  21 September 2014 (US news editors rebuke Obama)  Leading US news editors rebuked Obama for making the US government more secretive and for intimidation of journalists.  21 September 2014 (The poor to bear global heating cost)  Rich countries including the US are going back on their promises to help poor countries cope with the damages of global heating.  It was inevitable that, as those increased, the rich countries would someday face so much expense coping with those increasing damages that they would refuse to help other countries. Eventually the rich countries themselves will be unable to cope.  However, the austerity that the plutocrats have imposed on the US has made it happen sooner.  21 September 2014 (Less CO2 emissions from Australia)  Australia is drifting into less CO2 emissions, which is good, but means it should adopt a more ambitious target.  21 September 2014 (New Zealand voters reelect spying liars)  New Zealand voters reelected the rulers that spy on them all and lied about it.  One might be tempted to say that they deserve such mistreatment, but that is fallacious. Only half of them chose it &mdash; but all are now stuck with it.  21 September 2014 (Nadya ToloKonnikova)  Nadya Tolokonnikova continues working in Russia to oppose Putin's regime, and global capitalism on the side.  I don't oppose capitalism as such &mdash; the existence of private businesses. However, what some call "global capitalism" is more plutocracy than capitalism as such, and I oppose plutocracy.  21 September 2014 (Peanut contamination hidden)  Executives of a US peanut plant have been sentenced to prison for falsifying contamination test records. 9 people died from the contamination that they hid this way.  21 September 2014 (New Pun: Fossil Fuels)  New pun: Fossil Fuels.  21 September 2014 (Record-breaking fires in California)  California has had the driest three years ever recorded, causing record-breaking fires, and it's expected to get worse in the coming months.  The fire season in the US west has increased, typically, by 70 days since a few decades ago. That is long-term change, global heating at work.  The fires convert trees into carbon dioxide, adding to global heating. Positive feedbacks like this mean that at some point (which we can't predict) global heating will become self-perpetuating.  The fools running the University of California refused to divest from fossil fool companies.  They think divestment would cut the income for running the university. That's probably true, for the next few years at least. They'd certainly be better off continuing the status quo &mdash; but they are fools to think that is what they have chosen.  Have they thought about how much funds the University of California will lose when global heating wrecks the state economy? When drought eliminates half the farming in California, and the forests are burning up, do they think the state will prioritize the university over firefighters? If global heating continues unchecked, some sort of University of California may still exist in 30 years, but it will be a shadow of its present-day self.  If the regents were wiser, they would grab at any chance to avoid that fate. Divestment at least offers a chance.  This is much worse than rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. They are on the oil train, rolling slowly torwards Lac-M&eacute;gantic, and trying to save money by not putting on the brakes.  21 September 2014 (Wisconsin voter ID law)  Republican judges authorized Wisconsin's voter ID law less than two months before the election. 300,000 voters may be disenfranchised, and it would be very hard for them to get IDs even if they can afford to try.  Republicans impose voter ID laws because most citizens that don't have IDs are among the weak who are likely to vote Democrat.  21 September 2014 (London thugs beat helpless man)  The London thug department apologized to Nordell Edmonson. A gang of thugs pulled him out of his car and hit him with sticks while he was helpless &mdash; supposedly because he was driving without insurance.  If he was indeed driving without insurance &mdash; I would not take the thugs word for it &mdash; he deserved to be tried, not beat up.  Edmonson is not satisfied with payment of compensation, because that helps him only. He wants action to curb the violence of the thugs.  21 September 2014 (Australian "anti-terrorism" law)  The proposed Australian "anti-terrorism" law would permit torture.  This law is clearly unnecessary; an alleged terrorist plot involving real violence was watched and the planners were arrested yesterday.  21 September 2014 (Putin to set up internet disconnect switch)  Putin has plans to set up means to disconnect the Russian internet from the rest of the world in an "emergency".  "Emergency" in this case means Russians' paying attention to criticism of Putin.  21 September 2014 (NSA part of blackmail system)  Since the NSA hands over data about Palestinian-Americans' communications to Israel, and Israel uses such data to blackmail Palestinians in Palestine, it looks like the NSA is part of the blackmail system.  20 September 2014 (Transportation of oil)  Canada's extraction lobbyist hopes that more disasters with oil trains will convince the US to approve Keystone XL.  However, looking at the harm done by extracting it as well as by burning it the best option is to stop transporting that oil in any way.  20 September 2014 (Rebuking abuses of power in China)  Ilham Tohti is about to be convicted of bogus charges after a phony trial. His unpardonable crime was to rebuke abuses of power rather than advocate Uighur nationalism.  20 September 2014 (Abandoned oil wells)  Pennsylvania has 200,000 abandoned oil wells, and when fracking is done near them, they become channels for leaking methane.  21 September 2014 (Mexican soldiers captured and then summarily shot 22 people)  Mexican soldiers captured and then summarily shot 22 people, including members of a drug gang, and others who said they had been kidnaped by the gang.  21 September 2014 (Egypt's regime has made religion an arm of the state)  Egypt's regime has made religion an arm of the state. Atheists have been threatened with arrest.  21 September 2014 (NFL player charged with violence against a woman)  Yet another NFL football player is charged with violence against a woman: he appears have tried to force his wife to have sex, then hit her and broke her nose. This together with manipulative threats.  21 September 2014 (The world's population)  Decrease of the human population growth rate has ceased in sub-Saharan Africa. The world's population threatens to grow to 11 billion by 2100.  I don't think it can reach that level &mdash; the consequences will cause global disaster before then, and many children will die. But that is a horrible way to limit the population.  21 September 2014 (Microbeads in toothpaste)  Microbeads in toothpaste can hurt users' gums, as well as wildlife after they go down the drain.  21 September 2014 (Forced to Collect Human Waste by Hand)  India's "Untouchables" Are Still Being Forced to Collect Human Waste by Hand.  There are two wrongs here: the fact that many Indians don't have flushing toilets (which is a matter of poverty and overpopulation) and the fact that certain people are forced to clean them. If caste prejudice were eliminated, the second wrong would be gone but the first wrong would remain.  21 September 2014 (License plate cameras)  A California court denied a driver's suit to gain access to the data that license plate cameras have collected about him.  We should not allow license plate cameras to record seeing any particular plate, unless that plate is invalid or sought by court order.  21 September 2014 (Enslavement of high tech workers in Malaysia)  More about enslavement of high tech workers in Malaysia, and suggestions for ending it.  21 September 2014 (Vote counting for Scotland's referendum)  Russian observers say that the vote counting for Scotland's referendum on independence was not done in accord with international norms.  This is a cheap shot &mdash; the Scottish referendum should have been run according to standards, but that does not validate Putin's phony elections in the Crimea or in Russia.  21 September 2014 (Mother Jailed for Sending Semi-Naked Photos of Daughters)  Mother Jailed for Sending Semi-Naked Photos of Daughters to Dance Teacher.  It appears that the dance teacher manipulated her into doing this so that her daughters would be admitted or kept in the dance school. He abused his power, but I don't think she should be punished.  21 September 2014 (The West Is Acting on Ebola)  Finally, The West Is Acting on Ebola. What Took Us So Long?  21 September 2014 (Atheist airman)  The US Air Force allowed an Atheist airman to swear his oath to support the Constitution without citing a deity.  20 September 2014 (Torture by Nigerian thugs)  Torture is standard practice for Nigerian thugs.  20 September 2014 (Fire near Sacramento)  A fire near Sacramento has burned over 110 square miles and is threatening 2000 houses.  Since global heating is making California more arid, this will be a frequent occurrence in a couple of decades.  20 September 2014 (Agent Orange-resistant GMO crops)  The USDA approved GMO corn and soybeans resistant to the herbicide 2,4-D, which was used in Agent Orange during the Vietnam war.  Superweeds will experience a temporary setback, but in a few years they will evolve resistance to this chemical too.  20 September 2014 (Paying to prevent discussions)  Many companies give money to political parties to prevent an issue from ever being discussed.  20 September 2014 (For-profit schools)  A US for-profit college company has been sued for predatory lending.  I think it is a good idea to prohibit for-profit schools, and for-profit hospitals too.  Philanthropists are buying the students' loans in order to forgive them.  This is necessary because the US has made it impossible to get rid of student loans through bankruptcy. That law is cruel.  20 September 2014 (Obama's "free trade" proposals)  Obama continues to propose to boost exports with antidemocratic "free trade" treaties. The existing ones have not had that effect, but the US Trade Representative is giving Congress fudged statistics to pretend that they did.  Even if they did boost exports, it would not be particularly good, because that principally means more profit for US businesses. Nowadays that growth does little good for US workers, due to the antidemocratic effects of these same treaties. So there is no reason for Americans to make increased exports a goal at all.  20 September 2014 (Pay toilets)  How pay toilets were eliminated in the US.  I wish other countries would pass similar laws.  20 September 2014 (Assad may help US target bombing of ISIS)  Reports say that Assad has agreed to US bombing of ISIS forces in Syria.  If Assad does indeed help target the attacks, that would be useful since they would be less likely to hit the wrong targets. But I worry about one thing: would Assad dishonestly supply coordinates of non-ISIS rebels, claiming they were ISIS?  20 September 2014 (Japan's "scientific" whaling)  Japan's "scientific" whaling has produced just two peer-reviewed papers since 2005.  The papers were based on 9 out of the 3600 minke whales Japan has killed during that time.  20 September 2014 (US citizen reports from Yemen prison)  Sharif Mobley found a way to phone his wife and told her he was being tortured in Yemen's prison.  It appears that the Obama regime and Yemen's regime are collaborating to imprison him without trial. He faces criminal charges, perhaps bogus, but the Yemen regime is sabotaging the trial by refusing to bring him to court.  20 September 2014 (Estate tax)  Senator Sanders proposes a law to make rich heirs start paying estate tax again.  20 September 2014 (Japan to disregard vote on whaling)  Japan announced it will disregard the International Whaling Commission's vote to limit whaling in the Southern Ocean.  20 September 2014 (Price on carbon emissions)  Big investment groups called for a "stable, reliable and economically meaningful" price on carbon emissions.  20 September 2014 (Metadata)  What can be learned about Ton Siedsma from one week of his metadata? Quite a lot.  20 September 2014 (Playing while black)  Darrien Hunts' sword had a rounded edge, so he could hardly have seriously threatened anyone with it. It appears that, before the thugs shot him, he was making moves with the sword as a form of pretend play, away from other people.  The most dangerous looking thing about him was his skin color. If you're a black male, in the US, people will often perceive your actions as dangerous; if a while male did the same thing, people would not consider it dangerous. Over and over, this leads thugs to kill innocent people.  20 September 2014 (Enslaved Malaysian workers)  A large fraction of the workers in Malaysia's electronics factories are enslaved.  20 September 2014 (Being lured into war by videos)  The head of the Lib Dems says he won't let the UK be lured into war with ISIS by provocative videos. There are surely some US politicians that are wise enough to reject that, but the mainstream media don't present them much.  19 September 2014 (The silence on global heating)  The Silence on Climate Change Is Deafening. It's Time for Us to Get Loud.  The term "climate change" was coined by the denialist movement to make global heating sound neutral rather than dangerous. It makes no sense for us to use that term.  19 September 2014 (Price of meeting UK ministers)  The Tories have been so successful at enriching UK businesses that they have doubled the price of meeting ministers.  19 September 2014 (Canadian PM to skip climate summit)  Canadian PM Harper will skip the climate summit.  Not surprising, for a government that gags scientists to cover up the unpleasant facts of global heating.  19 September 2014 (US criticism undermined)  US criticism of Putin's expansionism and destabilization is undermined by several instances where the US did or supported similar actions.  19 September 2014 (US universities militarizing thugs)  US universities are getting M-16 assault rifles, even grenade launchers, for their campus thugs. It is dangerous for them to have such weapons.  18 September 2014 (Urgent: Statement of support for Greenpeace protesters)  US citizens: sign a statement of support for Greenpeace protesters in Cincinnati, who face ten years' imprisonment under Putinesque charges.  18 September 2014 (Urgent: Cleanup of pipeline spill)  US citizens: Tell House Energy Chair Upton to give the polluters' campaign money to the cleanup of the pipeline spill in his district.  19 September 2014 (ISIS threatening to attack the White House)  ISIS released another provocative video, this one threatening to attack the White House.  The ISIS propaganda team is clever, and surely expects this to make a lot of US politicians demand war so that they can look tough. I continue to claim that ISIS wants the US to fight so that it can convince Iraqi Sunnis that they have no choice but to support ISIS.  18 September 2014 (Urgent: Powerplant carbon limits)  US citizens: call on the EPA to make powerplant carbon limits strong enough to do the job.  18 September 2014 (Thugs attacked a BBC team in Moscow)  A group of thugs (not necessarily official state thugs) attacked a BBC team in Moscow; while the team was reporting the attack to the official thugs, someone erased their computers' memories.  Apparently some of Putin's men wanted to stop them from reporting on a Russian soldier apparently killed in Ukraine.  18 September 2014 (Russian writer Mikhail Shishkin)  Russian writer Mikhail Shishkin says that Putin has taken Russia back to "Soviet times of total lies", and that Putin's violence is preparing Russians to support a series of wars.  Putin's nationalist propaganda resembles the US propaganda used to convince Americans to have faith that the US is the "good guy" in every war, in disregard of all truth. However, Putin's version is even stronger.  Here's more about Mikhail Shishkin.  I am saddened by the Americans that grasp at straws to argue that Putin's lies are truth and that the fault lies entirely with Kiev.  There certainly is some wrong on Kiev's side. Its deal with the EU could pave the way for "shock capitalism" and disastrous debt. There are indeed neo-nazi militias fighting for Kiev.  Kiev's rejection of easterners' demands for limited autonomy was unjustified. But none of this alters the nature of Putin's military aggression in Ukraine.  18 September 2014 (Pakistani professor assassinated)  A Pakistani professor who promoted a liberal interpretation of Islam's social rules was assassinated.  18 September 2014 (Battle over cutting Tasmania's old-growth forests)  The battle over cutting Tasmania's old-growth forests will resume, with a government ban on protests condemned by the UN.  18 September 2014 (Chevron trying to buy city council election)  Chevron is trying to buy the city council election in Richmond, California using smears and confusion.  18 September 2014 (Sucking the US into war)  Many experts warn that ISIS propaganda videos are intended to suck the US into a war that would legitimize ISIS among Sunnis and thus strengthen it.  US hawks that call for immediate war are motivated by domestic politics. If as a byproduct of political gain they strengthen ISIS, that's not important to them.  18 September 2014 (Cutting poverty)  What the US government must do if it wants to cut poverty.  18 September 2014 (Posting negative reviews about businesses)  California passed a bill banning businesses from making customers agree not to post negative reviews. One is proposed at the US level.  I wonder whether these measures also cover the attempt to require customers to assign copyright on their reviews to the business.  18 September 2014 (Nationalism)  As surrender to plutocracy spreads poverty across Europe, nationalism offers the prospect of a magical escape without confronting the real root of the injustice.  Often nationalism puts the blame for poverty on "parasitic" immigrants rather the principal parasites &mdash; the rich.  18 September 2014 (FinFisher)  The German government allowed the intrusion software FinFisher to be sold to governments that trample human rights.  The article errs in talking about "Linux computers"; the context shows that this refers to the GNU/Linux system.  18 September 2014 (Hottest August ever recorded)  August 2014 was the hottest August ever recorded, just like May and June.  18 September 2014 (China torturing professor)  Professor Ilham Tohti, who wrote in favor of Uighurs' rights, is being tortured as preparation for his show trial.  18 September 2014 (Global heating denial for kids)  Texas is trying to rewrite textbooks to deny global heating.  18 September 2014 (Limited autonomy in Eastern Ukraine)  Ukraine's government has adopted partial autonomy for the Eastern region where the rebellion is occurring.  This limited autonomy seems natural to me, given that every part of the United States has it. Did Ukraine offer this limited autonomy at the beginning?  18 September 2014 (Apples unjust power over users)  Lots of iThing users are complaining that they did not want the U2 album "gift" that Apple stuck them with &mdash; and that it was hard to delete.  These complaints focus on a superficial problem, which reflects the shallow thinking that Apple instills in its users. Ironically, though, this superficial problem reflects a much deeper problem that the complainers have failed to notice: the unjust power that Apple has imposed on whoever uses an iThing or iTunes.  18 September 2014 (TSA gropes passenger after flight)  Agents of the Theater of Security Agency demanded to grope a passenger after he got off a flight, claiming it was because they had forgotten to do this before the flight.  18 September 2014 (Resource distribution for voting places)  Some US states provide fewer resources to voting places with more minority groups, causing long waiting lines.  One must suspect this is another method of Republican voter suppression.  18 September 2014 (New Mexico sheriff faces charges)  A New Mexico sheriff faces charges for two cases of attacking passing drivers.  18 September 2014 (Mass surveillance in New Zealand)  New Zealand Prime Minister Key is changing and contradicting his statements to try to deny revelations about the massive surveillance he started.  18 September 2014 (US gov't still trying to smear Snowden)  The US government continues trying to smear Snowden with falsified claims that his disclosures aided terrorists.  Even if they had been of some use to underground enemies of Americans, that harm would be small compared with the positive contribution of giving us a chance to recover democracy.  18 September 2014 (Cost of sea level rise)  Sea level rise could cause over 200 billion dollars in damages to buildings and infrastructure in Australia in this century.  For the US, I would guess it is ten times that. Has anyone seen a recent estimate?  18 September 2014 (Man shot in the back by thugs)  Thugs said they shot Darrien Hunt because he lunged at them with a sword. However, an autopsy found he was shot in the back.  Surveillance camera recordings have been provided to the thugs but not to Hunt's family.  18 September 2014 (Racism among US thugs)  Attorney General Holder launched a study of racism among US thugs.  It is a good idea. If only he went after the banksters and the torturers, he'd be doing a good job.  18 September 2014 (Persecution of Botswana journalists)  The president of Botswana is persecuting journalists that reported on his car accident.  18 September 2014 (Prisoner granted euthanasia)  Belgium has granted a prisoner's petition for euthanasia.  I understand and sympathize with a prisoner's wish to die rather than spend life in prison.  It worries me that there's a danger this will encourage prison conditions designed to encourage suicide, a de-facto death penalty. However, such conditions exist in many countries, including the US, where euthanasia is not allowed.  18 September 2014 (New pollution controls cut Australian coal)  New Chinese pollution controls on coal will cut into Australian coal exports.  This is a great opportunity for Australia to cancel all the planned expansions in coal mining.  18 September 2014 (Imprisonment of Ghoncheh Ghavami)  Ghoncheh Ghavami has been imprisoned in Iran for 3 months for asking to be allowed to watch a sporting event alongside men.  18 September 2014 (The Fate of the Gaza Ceasefire)  Noam Chomsky: The Fate of the Gaza Ceasefire.  18 September 2014 (Invasion by Israeli "settlers")  Israeli "settlers" invaded Hebron and pepper-sprayed two Palestinian children, who had to be taken to a hospital.  18 September 2014 (Google's support for ALEC)  Google refuses to respond to public criticism of its support for ALEC.  18 September 2014 (Drug smuggling funds Jihadi groups)  Jihadi groups in north Mali run on funds obtained by smuggling drugs north.  I seem to recall that Islam disapproves of these drugs. It would be hard to reconcile the smuggling with being an "Islamist".  18 September 2014 (Tax rules for multinational companies)  44 economically powerful countries are drawing up a plan to make multinational companies pay taxes.  18 September 2014 (Deal made with Qatar)  Qatar has made a deal to reduce its support for Islamist parties. The deal also includes ordering al-Jazeera to stop criticizing Egypt for its bloody suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood.  I shed no tears for those religious extremists, but al-Jazeera has been hurt by this. We have seen evidence of bias in al-Jazeera imposed from above, but this blatant censorship is shameful nonetheless.  17 September 2014 (Teenagers doing less harmful things)  Teenagers in many countries are drinking less, using drugs less, even getting pregnant less. Perhaps that's because they expect to be punished all their lives if they do those things, and expect the adult world to be one that condemns all but a small fraction winners to hopeless poverty.  It's good that teenagers do less of these harmful things, but not good at all that plutocracy has made adult life so hard.  17 September 2014 (Curbing global heating without harming economic growth)  The New Climate Economy report claims it is possible to curb global heating without harming economic growth.  17 September 2014 (Urgent: Support H.Con.Res.114)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to support H.Con.Res.114, which says that any sustained US combat in Iraq or Syria requires congressional authorization.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  17 September 2014 (Medical marijuana)  An Australian state is moving to legalize medical marijuana but only for people who are dying.  The people who need this most are the ones that might be saved by chemotherapy if they can stand the suffering it causes.  17 September 2014 (Forest fires)  Indonesia has agreed to do more to stop the forest fires that people set for the purpose of deforestation.  Indonesia should make it illegal to farm land that was forest less than 10 years ago, use satellite photos to identify such farms, and destroy them so that the forest can come back.  17 September 2014 (Giganews logging accesses to newsgroups for FBI)  An insider accuses Giganews of logging all accesses to newsgroups for the FBI.  17 September 2014 (US must stop claiming that the law is secret)  To comply with the principles of human rights, the US must stop claiming that the law is secret. Secret "law" is really arbitrary rule.  The "13 Necessary and Proportionate Principles" that the EFF advocates may be necessary and proportionate, but they are not sufficient to achieve their goal: to protect society from massive total surveillance. They were designed for a different context, before Snowden showed us how far surveillance really goes even in "free" countries; then they were transferred to this issue without rethinking them.  What we really need is to redesign digital systems so they don't surveil and track people.  17 September 2014 (Former guard at Auschwitz charged)  A former guard at Auschwitz has been charged as an accessory to 300,000 murders.  It turns out that this guard has campaigned against holocaust deniers.  17 September 2014 (Hagel proposes sending US troops into combat in Iraq)  "Defense" secretary Hagel proposes sending US troops into combat in Iraq to fight an unending war with no concept of victory.  Chelsea Manning &mdash; who was an Iraq intelligence analyst before becoming a heroic whistleblower &mdash; explains why this won't work.  If the goal is to win Iraqi Sunnis away from supporting ISIS, sending US troops to attack them again is the stupidest possible strategy. However, if the goal is to distract Americans with war fervor from the way plutocracy is oppressing them, it might work.  17 September 2014 (Large protests for democracy continue in Hong Kong)  Large protests for democracy continue in Hong Kong after China rejected free elections there.  17 September 2014 (Labeling GMOs)  Look at the companies donating money to oppose the Oregon referendum to require labeling GMOs.  17 September 2014 (Groundwater management)  California has enacted groundwater management.  17 September 2014 (Syria intervention plans)  Senator Machin says he will oppose Obama's misguided Syria intervention plans.  17 September 2014 (Another step towards near-universal poverty)  Web sites that make desperate people bid to do jobs for the lowest pay move society another step towards near-universal poverty.  17 September 2014 (A Diet for a Healthy Planet)  For the First Time, U.S. Agencies Consider a Diet for a Healthy Planet.  17 September 2014 (Israeli war crimes in Gaza)  Human Rights Watch identified several Israeli actions in Gaza that appear to be war crimes and must be investigated.  17 September 2014 (US military to fight Ebola)  Obama will send 3000 US military personnel to Africa to fight Ebola.  I can't judge the details but it seems to be a necessary job.  17 September 2014 (Urgent: Blanket use of antibiotics on farm animals)  US citizens: call on Obama to put a stop to blanket use of antibiotics on farm animals.  17 September 2014 (Tortured to death in an Israeli prison)  An autopsy suggests that a Palestinian prisoner was tortured to death in an Israeli prison.  17 September 2014 (Sacrificing the Vulnerable)  Sacrificing the Vulnerable, From Gaza to America.  17 September 2014 (Urgent: Block another Enbridge pipeline)  US citizens: call on Kerry to block another Enbridge pipeline plan for exporting Canadian tar sands oil.  17 September 2014 (Comcast threatens Tor users)  Users of Comcast are reporting that Comcast says they are not allowed to use Tor and threatening to terminate their service.  17 September 2014 (One-use plastic bags)  California has banned stores from handing out gratis one-use plastic bags.  We need to make bags, and other food packaging, out of plastics that will truly biodegrade in a few years.  I taught myself a couple of years ago to reuse larger, tougher plastic bags. I carry 3 of them in my computer bag and mostly avoid single-use bags.  17 September 2014 ("Democrats" backed by Chamber of Commerce)  The US Chamber of Commerce is backing some "Democrats", the sort who are almost like today's Republicans.  17 September 2014 (Foreign policy lessons learned)  Obama Has Indeed Learned Some Foreign Policy Lessons, Just Not the Ones the Establishment Likes  16 September 2014 (Urgent: Oppose arming Syrian rebels)  US citizens: sign this petition not to arm the Syrian rebels.  16 September 2014 (Urgent: Debate the war against ISIS)  US citizens: call on Congress to debate the war against ISIS.  Call on Obama to seek authorization for this war.  16 September 2014 (FCC receives 3 million comments)  The FCC received 3 million comments about network neutrality.  16 September 2014 (Frack wells contaminate drinking water)  Fracking's contamination of drinking water in Texas and Pennsylvania was due to leaky cement in frack wells, a study finds.  16 September 2014 (An end to rain in part of Brazil)  Deforestation and global heating have put an end to rain in part of Brazil.  16 September 2014 (Librarians campaigning to protect users)  Some librarians are campaigning to protect library users from massive digital surveillance.  16 September 2014 (Press access to Canadian scientist denied)  A newspaper requested an interview with a Canadian scientist about algae. Government officials had a discussion of 100 pages before they refused permission for him to talk to the press.  This is because the facts about the algae demonstrate effects of global heating, while the Canadian government wants to promote use of fossil fuel.  16 September 2014 (Rich French people dodging taxes)  Thousands of rich French people are dodging taxes by moving their money to Belgium.  France needs to tax these people no matter where they go.  16 September 2014 (How LA thugs see black people)  LA thugs saw a black woman kiss a white man in a car, and handcuffed her, making the assumption based on that alone that she was a prostitute. They do this every day, but this time they were embarrassed because she was a film star.  Real prostitutes don't deserve to be treated that way either, so jumping to the conclusion because of her race makes it two wrongs.  16 September 2014 (Biometric ID cards)  Nigeria is imposing biometric ID cards that include fingerprints and iris scans.  And share all the data with Mastercard.  National ID cards such as this are inherently oppressive. Nigeria faces a big terrorist threat, but these  cards will do no good whatsoever against it.  16 September 2014 (Airport expansions in London area)  British politicians distract attention from the need to reduce CO2 emissions by debating where to expand airports in the London area.  At least the estuary airport would be self-limiting, since global heating will eventually make it unserviceable.  16 September 2014 (UK eager to surrender sovereignty)  The UK's right-wing parties talk about recovering sovereignty from the EU, but they are eager to surrender sovereignty to businesses through TTIP (This Treaty Is Plutocratic).  16 September 2014 (Uruguayan marine faces charges in Italy)  An Uruguayan marine who snuck out to Italy when investigated for participation in government torture now faces charges in Italy.  16 September 2014 (Firing people for being gay)  A Republican congresscritter champions the right to fire people for being gay.  16 September 2014 (Urgent: UN control of fuel rod removal)  Everyone: sign this petition for the UN to take control of the removal of fuel rods from the fuel pool at Fukushima #4.  16 September 2014 (Whaling)  Scientists Don't Need to Kill Whales to Study Them.  16 September 2014 (Plastic in the sea)  Sea animals near Australia are eating plastic, 3/4 of which comes from waste from cities.  16 September 2014 (Israeli military intelligence)  The Israeli military intelligence reservists who revealed that their work included blackmailing innocent Palestinians have been condemned for puncturing the claim that Israel's army is "the most moral in the world".  Those reservists believe their army is really supposed to be the world's most moral. That's why they are disgusted with what it really is.  16 September 2014 (Militarization of thug forces)  Militarization of thug forces implies that they are  occupying enemy territory, but who in the US is the enemy? Blacks, principally. This article makes the connection between militarization and racism.  The article also explains that the occupation of Ferguson puts on display the weapons and armor that most often are used to attack private homes, unseen by anyone except the people who live there.  Although non-blacks are not inherently part of the enemy, anyone such as a protester or journalist whose actions support the enemy is treated as one of them.  16 September 2014 (Urgent: Put a price on carbon emissions)  US citizens: sign this petition to put a price on carbon emissions.  16 September 2014 (Urgent: Disclose fracking chemicals)  US citizens: sign this petition to require disclosure of fracking chemicals.  16 September 2014 (Urgent: Abortions in Pennsylvania)  Everyone: call on the Pennsylvania legislature to stop impeding abortion.  16 September 2014 (NSA's penetration in Germany)  Information provided by Edward Snowden proves that the NSA has penetrated national and international networks operated by German companies in ways that they cannot figure out.  16 September 2014 (Global heating and plutocracy)  Naomi Klein connects global heating to the plutocratic system that has subjugated democracy.  Klein is right that reducing your personal energy consumption is not an effective action. Under a market system, the fossil fuel you don't use will be sold to someone else. The way to reduce the total use of fossil fuel is by macro-policies such as placing more tax on such use.  The let's-win-over-the-billionaires environmentalism that Klein shows is ineffective is the climate analogue of "open source," which says, "Let's win over the businesses by not saying things they wouldn't like." They got a lot of  shallow success, but it didn't have deep roots.  16 September 2014 (Endangered sharks)  Shark meat is popular in Indonesia, and tuna fishers catch and sell lots of endangered sharks as "by catch".  16 September 2014 (Yangtze river sturgeon going extinct)  The Yangtze river sturgeon is following the Yangtze river dolphin into extinction.  16 September 2014 (UK prison budget cuts)  In the UK, prisoners regularly die or commit suicide as a result of prison budget cuts. They see no point in reporting when they are raped.  There are no funds for rehabilitation, which puts a burden on the rest of society when they get out.  16 September 2014 (Massive surveillance in New Zealand)  The Prime Minister of New Zealand says that there is no massive surveillance there. Edward Snowden proves he is lying.  This was implemented in 2012/2013, under a law that was misrepresented as having a much smaller effect.  16 September 2014 (California drought)  The almond farms of California are rapidly exhausting the state's ground water.  Global heating will make droughts in California more frequent. For the short term, the state needs to manage its water rather than allow farmers to pump it at will.  For the long term&hellip;there won't be much farming in California, by and by, unless we curb global heating.  16 September 2014 (Unschoolers)  A study of unschoolers &mdash; people who were allowed as children to learn on their own for some years &mdash; shows that they turned out quite well as adults. They had no trouble getting into college or being successful there.  I suspect that one of the conditions for this to be successful was that the children did not feel the threat of poverty and were not surrounded by despair. It might not work for most children of the non-rich in the US today.  16 September 2014 (China harassing foreign journalists)  China is systematically harassing and excluding foreign journalists, and pressuring their Chinese assistants to spy on them.  The US is not blemish-free in this area: it requires foreign journalists to get a special visa. The US should repeal this law so that it can effectively criticize other countries.  16 September 2014 (The right to offend people)  A teenager in Pennsylvania faces two years in prison for faking oral sex with a statue of Jesus.  This law should certainly be unconstitutional. The right to offend people is part of freedom of speech.  16 September 2014 (Ransoming hostages)  The relatives of James Foley report that US officials told them that paying a ransom for him would be a crime.  This policy is just and necessary to avoid encouraging the taking of more hostages. Foley's relatives, mad with grief, would have saved Foley by endangering others; the officials prevented this. It's not that they didn't understand what it's like to be a relative of a hostage. Rather, it's that they recognized their duty was not solely to that family. I only wish President Reagan could have been prosecuted for ransoming hostages from terrorists.  The one doubt that occurs to me is whether ransoming hostages might encourage terrorism less than letting them be used in the snuff videos that are effective propaganda for ISIS. The current policy was not chosen for a situation like this, which nobody envisioned.  Meanwhile, it is foolish to criticize the US government for not rescuing Foley. I'm sure the Pentagon was looking for a chance to rescue these hostages, but that is much easier said than done. Many attempts to rescue hostages have ended up killing them instead.  There are plenty of reasons to criticize US foreign policy, but we shouldn't endorse every criticism just because the US is its target.  16 September 2014 (More hunger as agribusiness grows)  The concentration of agribusiness has resulted in record production while hunger continues to grow.  16 September 2014 (Asylum-seekers in Australia)  Asylum-seekers in Australia are treated worse than the inmates of asylums; they can be put in solitary confinement for long periods.  I hope the recent supreme court decision puts an end to this.  16 September 2014 (National ID cards)  The Modi government expressed doubts about mandatory ID cards, before the election. Now in power it strongly supports the imposition of ID cards.  Requiring a national ID card is an injustice in itself; taking everyone's fingerprints or iris scans is an even worse injustice.  16 September 2014 (Republicans United)  Not one Republican voted for the amendment to reverse the "Citizens United" decision.  15 September 2014 ("Bombing" ISIS)  Obama Is Picking Targets in Iraq and Syria While Missing the Point.  US officials have big disagreements about how dangerous ISIS is, and whether bombing will hurt it or help it.  The question is confused because the term "bombing" fails to distinguish between air strikes on troops engaged in battle and drone assassinations, but this distinction is crucial. Tactical air support focuses on heavy weapons and military vehicles, and it is easy to distinguish them from civilians. People don't have heavy weapons or HUMVs at home, even in Iraq. Thus, air support causes few civilian casualties, and those few, when they occur, are understandable.  By contrast, drone assassinations often kill civilians in their homes and cars; in Pakistan and Yemen, those casualties, coming literally and figuratively out of the blue, have inspired understandable lasting hatred against the US.  For the moment, the US campaign against ISIS is mostly air support for the armies fighting ISIS. I'm in favor of providing such support. We see already that it is effective: it has prevented ISIS from conquering thousands of people and likely butchering them wholesale. It has also resulted in rather easy recapture of substantial territory, a vital dam, and some towns. As long as ISIS maintains armies fighting in the field, fighting them this way will be effective for the same reasons.  But Obama's speech shows he envisions continuing the fighting into a drone assassination campaign. A proper debate must treat those as two separate issues.  A drone assassination campaign in Iraq would be self-defeating as well as unjustifiable. Iraqi Sunnis would form ranks behind ISIS in response to the civilian casualties, producing a stalemate of suffering like that in Yemen. Such a stalemate never leads to victory; each day, the US would face the choice to terminate it and lose, or continue it and cause additional pointless suffering to preserve the status quo.  When Congress debates fighting ISIS, as is its duty, it must distinguish these two forms of fighting. If I were a member of Congress, I would vote for air support on the battlefield, for as long as ISIS keeps fighting on battlefields, but insist on prohibiting assassination campaigns.  15 September 2014 (New model of "trade" negotiations)  NGOs call on Congress to adopt a new model of "trade" negotiations, with goals to be stated in advance.  Given a Congress not subservient to business, this new system could give good results &mdash; but our current Congress is too submissive to adopt it.  15 September 2014 (The Need For Solidarity)  The US suffers from a lack of feelings and activities of general solidarity.  15 September 2014 (Taliban advancing)  The Taliban are advancing in parts of Afghanistan.  It's sad, but predictable. The Afghan government's army doesn't have the motivation needed to resist the Taliban. Afghans who oppose the Taliban aren't motivated to fight as much as the Taliban are motivated to fight.  We could continue to keep the Taliban out with permanent US intervention. We could do that for as long as the US has resources to do it, which won't be forever (in a few decades, global heating will be causing disaster in the US). But permanent victory against the Taliban depends on Afghans. We could continue war there until we go broke, but at the end the Taliban would come back unless Afghans opposed to the Taliban.  15 September 2014 (Canada subjugated to Chinese investors)  Canada's government has, in effect, subjugated Canada to Chinese investors (including the Chinese state) by allowing them to sue secretly to demand changes in Canadian government policies.  This includes extremely dangerous pipeline plans.  To subject one's country to such a treaty constitutes treason, in my view. A new Canadian government should abrogate the treaty.  15 September 2014 (US media on pension cuts)  The mainstream US media describe cutting workers' pensions as "responsible". If the government is forced to break promises, break promises to the rich before promises to the non-rich.  15 September 2014 (Video of witnesses in Ferguson)  Witnesses recorded immediately after Michael Brown was shot dead said that he had his hands up.  15 September 2014 ("Just-in-time" work schedule)  "Just-in-time" scheduling of hourly workers means that their part-time job rules them every hour of the week, although they only get paid for a fraction of those hours.  I think that businesses should be required to pay half wages for every hour that an hourly worker is on call to work with less than a week's notice.  15 September 2014 (Urgent: Authorization for expanding war in Iraq or Syria)  US citizens: call on Obama to get authorization for expanding war in Iraq or Syria.  For background.  15 September 2014 (Obama's plans for war with ISIS)  Obama's plans for war with ISIS depend on allies that have not shown an ability to do what is required.  I think the article underestimates the peshmerga. They had to retreat when ISIS attacked with its captured US heavy weapons and armored vehicles, but were able to advance with US air support. So were the Shi'ite Iraqi militias. The problem with them is that strengthening them pushes Iraqi Sunnis to support ISIS.  15 September 2014 (Australia's ancient rock art threatened)  Australia's ancient rock art is threatened by miners, tourists and animals.  15 September 2014 (Boko Haram suffered a big defeat)  Boko Haram suffered a big defeat in a pitched battle in Nigeria.  One such defeat won't destroy the group, but could inspire the Nigerian army to fight harder from now on, if the government gives this priority.  15 September 2014 (New Jersey prosecutor McClain)  New Jersey prosecutor McClain went easy on a football player that knocked his fianc&eacute;e unconscious, but threw the book at a women for carrying a gun with a permit from Pennsylvania.  To carry a gun for protection against future robberies is not necessarily a wise idea; it may cause more danger than it avoids. That's an unrelated issue and has no effect on this one, but I shouldn't mention the idea of getting a gun for self-protection without mentioning these doubts also.  15 September 2014 (Advertising on NPR)  The new CEO of National Public Radio intends to get more money from advertising by advertising more attractive products.  I used to give money to a local NPR station, but I stopped when I noticed that the shows had started to include commercials.  15 September 2014 (Urgent: Encryption standards)  US citizens: call on Congress to remove the requirement for NIST to consult the NSA specially about encryption standards.  15 September 2014 (Republican filibuster)  A Republican filibuster killed the constitutional amendment to stop companies from buying elections for Republicans.  15 September 2014 (Universities' choice of professors)  The Koch brothers are trying to buy control over universities' choice of professors, for political purposes.  15 September 2014 (China rents pandas to zoos)  China rents pandas to zoos for a lot of money as part of a general system of pressuring countries for trade advantage. Meanwhile, the habitat for wild pandas is being wiped out.  14 September 2014 (Being scared of partner not "normal")  A relationship where the woman says she is scared of the man should not be considered "normal".  14 September 2014 (Gun control activist threatened)  The leader of a gun control protest in Chicago is receiving death threats from US gun nuts, who call him a "terrorist".  He isn't one, but they and their threats are coming pretty close.  14 September 2014 (Campaigns of false criticism)  Zoe Quinn is the victim of a campaign of false criticism that was organized dishonestly from the beginning by people that wanted to do her harm.  You can see something similar though smaller in the attacks against me that are posted in some forums. They not only make strained criticism, they also misrepresent the free software movement drastically (as you can see for yourself by comparing their statements with gnu.org).  14 September 2014 (War)  This Is the Third World War &mdash; And This Time We Are on the Fringes.  I think there is some truth in this, but it's not entirely true. Conflict between Shi'ites and Sunnis, like conflict between Catholics and Orthodox and Muslims in the former Yugoslavia, is not inevitable. It is stimulated or provoked by political parties that expect short-term gain, and many of them could theoretically be convinced to stop.  14 September 2014 (Deforestation)  Most deforestation on Earth is done commercially, and half of it is done to get products to sell to the wealthy countries.  Deforestation in the Amazon jumped by almost 1/3 last year.  14 September 2014 (Urgent: Preserve food labeling law)  US citizens: call on your senators to preserve the US law requiring food to be labeled by the country of origin.  14 September 2014 (UN's vote on stopping oppressive debt)  The UN General Assembly voted to start negotiations on a treaty to allow states to get rid of oppressive debt.  The US was among 10 countries that voted against. Shame on you, Obama.  14 September 2014 (The courage that saved the ozone layer)  Stopping Climate Meltdown Needs the Courage That Saved the Ozone Layer.  That means daring to tell powerful businesses to drop dead rather than let them kill us.  14 September 2014 (Ebola intervention)  Scientist Who Identified Ebola Virus Calls for "Quasi-Military Intervention".  14 September 2014 (Expensive UK privatizations)  The UK government is trying to set up privatizations so that they are too expensive to cancel.  They act like raiders who have taken control of the state and intend to destroy as much as they can before they are chased out.  The just response would be to impose a 200% tax on those businesses, or make it a crime to continue to exercise such a contract.  13 September 2014 ("School police" get armored vehicle)  San Diego's "school police" has acquired a mine-resistant armored vehicle. They must think students will riot against whatever follows the Common Core and might turn to improvised explosive devices.  13 September 2014 (Citing BP for "gross negligence")  Citing BP for "gross negligence" hardly did justice to the company's persistent pattern of safety violations around the world.  13 September 2014 (Key Points from Obama's Isis Speech)  Seven Key Points from Obama's Isis Speech And What They Actually Mean.  I disagree with the article on the conclusion of the first point. If it's a question of fighting threats to the US, it does not follow that the US should only fight the worst one. But this is a side issue, since it's relevant only if you believe that the most important thing about ISIS is whether it threatens the US directly.  The second point's conclusion is simply wrong. There is nothing "preventive" about responding to a continuing armed attack.  However, the other five points are valid.  13 September 2014 (University of Sydney disinvites NGOs)  The University of Sydney disinvited two Sri Lankan NGOs from an international human rights event, caving to pressure from Sri Lanka's brutal government.  13 September 2014 (Dictatorship in Russia)  People have called Belarus "Europe's last dictatorship", but Russia has more or less become equal to it.  Regardless of what organizations it may join, Azerbaijan is not in Europe. It is in the Middle East.  13 September 2014 (NSA interception of mail packages)  It appears that the NSA intercepted the Thinkpad keyboard that Andrea Shepard, a Tor developer in Seattle, had ordered from Amazon. Presumably this was to sabotage it. I wonder if people have studied this keyboard to see what the NSA changed.  If you are any sort of activist, don't order a computer by mail yourself. Have a friend order it, after discussing the plan in person with no mobile phones around.  13 September 2014 (Divest from fossil fuel companies)  Almost 250 teachers at Boston University have called on the university to divest from fossil fuel companies.  It is clear that conservation measures in Boston University itself will have only a tiny influence on world fossil fuel consumption. In a market system, if A decides not to buy some commodity, the price goes down and B or C buys more. We need to change the parameters of the system itself.  The direct financial effect of divestment by Boston University alone would also be small, but this approach has a better chance to turn into a movement by many universities, and that could intern influence policies to change the parameters.  13 September 2014 (Apple redesigning iThings)  Apple is redesigning iThings to help companies communicate users' personal data from one to another, and enable them to manipulate users better. This page shows the perverse viewpoint of someone who is on the companies' side and presents this malice as an advance.  They are also now designed to make it harder for victims to keep control of their budgets.  It is a truism that "if you don't pay, you're the product." But now we see that, with proprietary software, you are often the product even if you do pay.  13 September 2014 (Urgent: Remove Koch brother from WGBH board)  In Boston: rally at 3pm on Oct 1, at WGBH headquarters (1 Guest St), to remove a Koch brother from the WGBH board.  13 September 2014 (Constitutional limits on imprisonment of asylum seekers)  Australia's supreme court placed constitutional limits on imprisonment of asylum seekers.  13 September 2014 (Criminal Investigations into Gaza Attacks)  Israeli Military Orders Criminal Investigations into Gaza Attacks.  This is a promising development if they do an honest job, but I fear its purpose is only to deflect criticism.  13 September 2014 (Reducing US greenhouse gas emissions)  Presenting a feasible program of investment to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030.  It's doable, but the fossil fuel companies don't want it to be done. They intend to to force us to stay on track to global catastrophe.  13 September 2014 (Russia sent another convoy of "humanitarian aid")  Russia sent another convoy of "humanitarian aid" into Ukraine without Red Cross inspection.  I am sure they are carrying ammunition. If not, Putin would have had the Red Cross inspect them so he could refute such accusations.  13 September 2014 (Russian military vehicle spotted in Ukraine)  A Russian military vehicle was spotted in Ukraine. The soldiers running it said they were Russian mercenaries. Then they repainted it to disguise its origin.  13 September 2014 (Global heating effects threaten agriculture)  Global heating effects threaten agriculture, and the more diverse agriculture is, the better it can withstand those effects. Big agribusiness monoculture is driving agriculture in the wrong direction.  13 September 2014 (Turkey has increased internet censorship)  Turkey has increased internet censorship.  Internet censorship was one of the early signs that Erdogan was going to attack human rights in Turkey.  12 September 2014 (Israeli intel vets speak out)  43 veterans of Israel's military intelligence (equivalent to the NSA in the US) denounced their work as a system of oppression and political manipulation rather than a matter of national security.  The full text of their letter.  Quotes from their personal testimonies: The fact people were innocent was not at all relevant.  12 September 2014 (Fear of Ebola in Sierra Leone)  Fear of Ebola is making Sierra Leone life crazy.  In Liberia, MSF's treatment center is full.  12 September 2014 (US evidence about flight MA-17)  The US has declined to show whatever evidence it has about who shot down flight MA-17.  I find it implausible anyone intentionally fired at an airliner. Thus I believe that rebels fired at what they thought was a Ukrainian government plane.  12 September 2014 (Teacher risks dismissal for kids)  A Florida teacher is risking dismissal by refusing to spend a week administering a standardized computerized test.  12 September 2014 (Corporations at climate summits)  The UN has allowed corporations' interests to pervade the climate summits.  12 September 2014 (Illness caused by fracking)  In Pennsylvania, fracking causes illness in 40% of the households within 1km of a frackwell.  Fracking probably contributes even more to global heating than coal. Fracking should be banned, so that as we cut down coal mining, it is not replaced by another fossil fuel.  12 September 2014 (Fijian peacekeepers released)  Jabhat al-Nusra released the 45 Fijian peacekeepers that it took prisoner two weeks ago.  The job of these peacekeepers was to separate Syrian and Israeli forces. I think that no forces currently separate al-Nusra from the Israeli border.  12 September 2014 (Urgent: Stop funding global heating denial)  Everyone: call on Google, Microsoft and others to stop supporting global heating denialists.  12 September 2014 (Clinton's push for fracking)  How Hillary Clinton's State Department Sold Fracking to the World.  12 September 2014 (Reversal of ozone hole growth)  The ban on chlorofluorocarbons is starting to reverse the former growth of the ozone hole.  11 September 2014 (Obama trying to stretch presidential authority)  Obama is trying to stretch presidential authority to cover air attacks anywhere in the world. This is a dangerous precedent.  Obama calls ISIS a "terrorist group", but I think that term is misleading. ISIS does not seem to have carried out any terrorist attacks against civilians. It is murderous and oppressive, but in a different form. I would call it a gang army. They have been known for many years in the eastern Congo and other parts of Africa.  Obama says he will employ the tactic of drone assassination against ISIS because it has been so successful in Yemen and Somalia. The Islamist militias in those countries don't seem to have been defeated by years of drone assassinations.  The current round of air strikes against ISIS don't pose the same problems because they take the form of close air support in field battles. It is easy to distinguish soldiers with heavy weapons from civilians, so mistakes are unlikely. If some civilians are hit, their relatives will understand that battle zones are dangerous places to be.  But it appears that Obama expects the fight against ISIS to develop into an assassination campaign. If it does, it will generate support for ISIS.  11 September 2014 (New plan for Detroit's water supply)  The new plan for Detroit's water supply eliminates public accountability and paves the way towards future privatization.  11 September 2014 (Israel imprisoned retired Palestinian professor)  Israel has imprisoned a retired Palestinian professor, Yousef Abdul Haq, without charges.  Abdul Haq has been active in organizing nonviolent resistance to the occupation. It's not the first time he has been imprisoned without charges.  11 September 2014 (Wounded in Gaza struggle to find medical treatment)  12,000 wounded people in Gaza struggle to find medical treatment in the remaining hospitals.  11 September 2014 (The modern American witch hunt)  As part of the modern American witch hunt, a woman was convicted of endangering a fetus because she took methadone prescribed by her doctor.  11 September 2014 (Inability to buy newsprint)  Inability to buy newsprint is forcing some Venezuelan newspapers to close.  It takes dollars to buy imported paper, and how many bolivares you have to pay for each dollar depends on your level of privilege.  11 September 2014 (No reason to think ISIS wants to attack US)  The Secretary of Homeland Security says there is no reason to think ISIS wants to attack the US.  Don't be taken in by the exaggeration of politicians.  11 September 2014 (Atheist US Air Force officer is suing)  An Atheist US Air Force officer is suing for permission to take his oath of service without citing a deity &mdash; something that the Air Force permitted until a year ago.  11 September 2014 (Former Israeli officials back peace plan)  Former Israeli intelligence officials say Israel should agree to the Arab peace plan.  11 September 2014 (Praise for Steven Salaita)  Praise for Steven Salaita from other teachers and from his students.  Salaita was offered a job by the University of Illinois, which treacherously rescinded the offer a couple of weeks before the start of the school year.  11 September 2014 (Boycott of Israeli products)  Palestinians are boycotting Israeli products.  11 September 2014 (IPCC proposal for dealing with debt)  The IPCC proposed that governments surrender to their debt by borrowing more money to cope with the damage caused by global heating.  This would wipe out what remains of democracy in the world, and would not even reliably do what it is supposed to do.  Since the debt is the result of an unjust plutocratic regime, it needs to be erased, not be catered to by increasing debt.  11 September 2014 (Chinese censorship)  Chinese censorship demonstrates that the internet empowers tyrannical regimes, if they are clever.  To argue for human rights based on efficiency is turning things upside down. Freedom is more important than efficiency. We should sacrifice efficiency for freedom if necessary.  If we want freedom in the internet, we can't assume that will happen due to the nature of the internet. We have to fight for it. YOU have to fight for it.  11 September 2014 (ISIS and the fear-war complex)  The fear-war complex has convinced lots of Americans that ISIS is a direct threat to the US.  The US government is planning to pressure Iraq to adopt a federal scheme for the "security forces".  (Note that the article errs in speaking of the "Sunni majority". The Sunnis are a minority in Iraq, and the Iraqi government is controlled by the Shi'ite majority, which has used this power to oppress the Sunni minority.)  I don't know enough to say this can work, but it seems to be at least vaguely headed in a sensible direction.  However, the idea of supporting Syrians that are fighting both Assad and ISIS has serious problems: some of them are almost as fanatical Islamists as ISIS, and the rest tend to treat Islamists as rivals rather than enemies.  11 September 2014 (Persecution of homeless people)  Hawai'i's hotels are pushing to make it a crime to sleep or even sit on the sidewalk in Honolulu. The proper answer to those hotels is, "Give the homeless people a better place to sleep and sit, or shut up!"  Meanwhile, providing a camp on Sand Island is better than what many other US cities are doing.  11 September 2014 (Neo-Nazi Azov militia mumbling)  The neo-Nazi Azov militia battalion mumbles about overthrowing the government of Ukraine.  11 September 2014 (Russian troops withdrawn from Ukraine)  Ukraine says Russia has withdrawn most of its troops.  Offering some sort of partial autonomy to eastern Ukraine seems like a fine thing to do, and should not have required a war.  11 September 2014 (Global fight for a neutral net)  Join the global fight for a neutral net: Big Telecom vs THE WORLD.  11 September 2014 (B'Tselem to stop sharing with army)  The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem says it will not provide evidence of war crimes to the Israeli army, because the army has proved not to try seriously to investigate such crimes.  11 September 2014 (Funding for West Bank settlements)  Israel gives preferential funding to people living in colonies in Palestine.  11 September 2014 (Special Ops corporate bonanza)  Murky Special Ops Have Become Corporate Bonanza, Says Report.  11 September 2014 (Queensland bans suing to block mines)  Queensland, a state in Australia, has banned the general public from suing to block mines on environmental grounds.  Thus, when the state government is inclined to close its eyes to probable environmental harm &mdash; which it clearly is, or it would not pass such a law &mdash; citizens will be helpless to prevent the harm.  11 September 2014 (Effects of daily marijuana use)  A study finds that people under 17 years old that use marijuana every day suffer various harmful effects.  I don't think this can justify prohibition, because prohibition hurts a much larger number of people.  It is possible, though, that these teenagers used marijuana so much because they already had problems.  11 September 2014 (Urgent: Walmart video showing killing)  Everyone: Call on Walmart to release the video showing the killing of John Crawford.  11 September 2014 (Urgent: Stop harassment for student loans)  US citizens: call on the Department of Education to stop hiring debt collection companies to harass people for student loans.  We really need to restore the possibility to eliminate student loans through bankruptcy. Until we do that, this is a necessary first step.  11 September 2014 (Congressional approval of war)  Obama believes he is allowed to order bombing of Syria without congress.  If the president is allowed to bomb any country if he can convince it to accept some "noncombat" US troops, the requirement for Congressional approval of war is almost completely negated. Congress is inclined to approve this campaign, but it should demand to be asked so it can say yes.  11 September 2014 (Israel presents "evidence")  Israel presented a video from 2009 as "evidence" that Palestinians were firing from al-Wafa hospital.  The video was of a different building, and was put together with an unrelated audio track talking about a house (not a big building).  11 September 2014 (Hindu fanatics)  Hindu fanatics in India say they are going to convert "all" Christians and Muslims. This could only be done by threats of violence.  Meanwhile, when supposedly "Hindu" Dalits try to convert officially to Buddhism, they face violent interference.  11 September 2014 (Arbitrary detention in Australia)  Australia's government says Australians shouldn't worry about being arbitrarily stopped from leaving the country, because the officials will be so well trained that they will never make a mistake.  11 September 2014 (Teachout gets 1/3 of the vote)  Zephyr Teachout got 1/3 of the vote in the New York gubernatorial primary against incumbent business-subservient Democrat Andrew Cuomo.  11 September 2014 (Rapists protected by UK thugs)  An organized gang that raped children in the UK was protected assiduously by thugs: when a researcher discovered what was going on and reported it, they threatened to expose the researcher to the gang.  There are laws that dishonestly claim that every time someone under 16 or 18 (depending on where) has sex, it is "rape". Calling willing sex "rape" does not make it rape, and calling a 17-year-old who wants to have sex a "child" does not make that teenager a child.  However, this gang committed real rapes, and other real violence, and its victims included real children.  11 September 2014 (New rules of Federal Reserve Bank)  A subtle change in the rules of the Federal Reserve Bank (an organization run by the big US banks) requires those banks to dump municipal bonds. This could force many US cities into bankruptcy.  11 September 2014 (Crop varieties)  Development of new crop varieties depends on wild relatives of the crops, but global heating puts those relatives in danger.  11 September 2014 (CIA water torture)  CIA water torture was even more vicious than previously reported.  If the US wants to be morally superior to ISIS, it must punish all the torturers from Dubya on down.  11 September 2014 (Methane leaks from fracking)  Obama and Clinton take note: due to methane leaks, fracking is a bridge to nowhere. We must aim for renewables without delay.  The US leads the way in failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  11 September 2014 (Famous tree-huggers)  Famous tree-huggers can inspire us to actions that could save Earth's climate.  A Massachusetts district attorney dropped charges against two anti-coal protesters because he concluded their actions were justified to prevent global disaster.  11 September 2014 (UK's excuses to fine the poor)  The UK government has created lots of excuses to fine the poor, so it is no surprise that one man's death is directly tied to fining him.  11 September 2014 (Ferguson court fine income)  Ferguson's city council is voting to limit court fine income to 15% of the city revenue, instead of 21% as now.  What directly oppresses the poor citizens of Ferguson is the rules that the system follows, such as fining people for being unable to pay fines. Cutting out a little over 1/4 of the fines is insufficient to make a qualitative difference.  Some of the other changes might matter more.  11 September 2014 (If the US goes to war with ISIS)  If the US goes to war with ISIS, how long before Americans conclude that it was a mistake?  ISIS is evil enough that fighting ISIS is not inherently wrong. The same was true for Saddam Hussein &mdash; but launching a war against his regime made things worse in Iraq, and the same thing could easily happen again.  Thwarting ISIS in a conventional war of movement is easy. Destroying ISIS would mean an urban guerrilla war, which would be horrible (as it was 8 years ago in the same part of Iraq) and would not succeed. To really defeat ISIS requires convincing Iraq's Sunnis to kick ISIS out.  11 September 2014 (Limiting global heating)  Limiting global heating to 2C was an arbitrary target, and appears to be too much heating for safety.  11 September 2014 (Violence between individuals)  Violence between individuals kills ten times as many people as wars, and costs 40 times as much.  11 September 2014 (US customs bans famous French cheeses)  A silly and annoying rule change by US customs has banned famous French cheeses.  Another silly and annoying US customs rule is the one that prohibits import of all meat products, even soup mixes. Yes, it is conceivable that they could carry a prion disease &mdash; but nobody is going to feed the soup to cattle.  11 September 2014 (Ill treatment of models)  Models are in danger of being denied their pay unless they diet to an extent that is dangerously unhealthy. Except the stars, of course.  These abuses resemble what we see in other fields of work, so I wonder if there are general solutions that cover all fields.  For instance, how does it happen that models start in debt? Should it be a crime to make workers pay money to get a job?  11 September 2014 (Greenhouse gas emissions)  Greenhouse gas emissions in 2013 increased faster than any time since 1984.  11 September 2014 ("Open carry" for whites only)  John Crawford was shot dead by thugs in a Walmart while holding a BB gun he wanted to buy. It appears this was based on an exaggerated and false accusation from someone who was in the store.  The article shows why "open carry" laws effectively apply only to whites. It's too dangerous if you're black. Lawfully carrying a concealed gun can cause you trouble if you're a black; thugs frequently search you, and even though the gun is not a crime, the thugs will look for an excuse to charge you with something.  As a result, "stand your ground" laws are also whites-only.  10 September 2014 (Urgent: Publish consumers' complaints about financial companies)  US citizens: tell the CFPB to publish consumers' complaints about financial companies.  10 September 2014 (Urgent: Require frackers to disclose all the chemicals they use)  US citizens: call on the EPA to require frackers to disclose all the chemicals they use.  10 September 2014 (The ideology of ISIS)  The ideology of ISIS is based on modern European ideas, notwithstanding its pretension to return to the roots of Islam.  Exposing this might undermine ISIS propaganda.  10 September 2014 (Armored cars for thugs)  The manufactures of armored cars for thugs feel uncomfortable about admitting that they are made to repress protesters.  When US thugs use their military-style "counter-terrorism" gear for suppressing protests, it turns out to be illegal; thug departments that have done this could get in trouble.  Rather than fining these thug departments, it would be far more effective to take away their heavy weapons and armor.  Or maybe the rule won't get enforced.  10 September 2014 (Bahrain continues to repress dissidents)  Bahrain continues to repress dissidents.  10 September 2014 (US thugs have taken 2.5 billion dollars)  US thugs have taken 2.5 billion dollars in the past 13 years from people who were not charged with crimes.  No matter what Kafkaesque excuses they make, this is punishment without trial.  The US is also turning towards Pre-emptive prosecution, where the question is not whether you committed a crime but whether you might.  10 September 2014 (EU's dependence on Russia for natural gas)  The EU's dependence on Russia for natural gas is creating strong pressure for energy efficiency improvements.  10 September 2014 (TEPCO is withholding pay)  TEPCO is withholding pay from Fukushima cleanup workers.  One would think that such an important job, which has to be done right, should offer high pay to get the best workers.  10 September 2014 (Clinton's glowing review of Kissinger's book)  Clinton's glowing review of Kissinger's book shows what she is really made of.  10 September 2014 (Life Sentences for Some Homosexual Acts)  Gambia Passes Bill Imposing Life Sentences for Some Homosexual Acts.  10 September 2014 (Urgent: Call on OceanaGold to drop lawsuit)  Everyone: call on OceanaGold to drop its lawsuit which claims El Salvador is not allowed to protect its water supplies.  10 September 2014 (Deforesters murdered Peruvian activists)  Deforesters murdered Peruvian activists that campaigned against illegal logging.  10 September 2014 (US spending millions on aid projects that don't work)  In Africa, as formerly in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US is spending millions on aid projects that generally don't work because they never made sense.  10 September 2014 (Urgent: Get a warrant before using drones)  Everyone: urge California Gov Brown to sign the bill that requires thugs to get a warrant before using drones.  10 September 2014 (Accusation of sharing)  The BBC wants to make ISPs in Australia punish their customers on accusation of sharing &mdash; including anyone that makes heavy use of a VPN.  10 September 2014 (An end to the War on Drugs)  A group of former presidents and ministers calls for an end to the War on Drugs.  10 September 2014 (Poverty wages)  Janitors don't have to be paid poverty wages &mdash; if they unionize.  10 September 2014 (Modi has started denying global heating)  Modi, since his election, has started denying global heating.  Apparently he has surrendered to the "burn, baby, burn" lobby.  10 September 2014 (Urgent: Oppose Pebble Mine)  US citizens: tell the EPA not to allow the Pebble Mine.  10 September 2014 (Qatar slavery investigators freed)  The slavery investigators disappeared in Qatar have been freed.  10 September 2014 (Today's climate models)  Today's climate models, applied to 1990s data, predicted the slowdown in atmospheric heating of the 2000s.  There was no slowdown in global heating; rather, heat started going into the oceans rather than the low atmosphere.  10 September 2014 (Global heating threatens US birds)  Over half the bird species in the US, including the bald eagle, are threatened by global heating.  10 September 2014 (Still Scared Stupid)  Still Scared Stupid in the Age of Terrorism.  10 September 2014 (Greenpeace protesters face prosecution)  Greenpeace protesters in the US face felony prosecutions for a banner drop.  Putin in America?  10 September 2014 (Spanish thugs buying more arms)  Spanish thugs are buying more arms to escalate repression of suffering Spaniards.  10 September 2014 (Kidnaping of Estonian detective)  More about Russia's armed kidnaping of an Estonian detective.  10 September 2014 (NYC thugs beat handcuffed man)  A gang of 6 thugs in New York City handcuffed a man and then hit him repeatedly with sticks.  10 September 2014 (Companies show no shame at "Urban Shield")  The companies that sell armored vehicles and automatic weapons to US thugs are showing no shame at "Urban Shield".  09 September 2014 (Big Ag in Oregon)  Big Ag in Oregon procured a law giving farms immunity for dropping toxic pesticides on people's houses.  09 September 2014 (The US justice system)  The US justice system will believe in the impossible, to excuse killings by thugs, or to keep someone in jail.  09 September 2014 (Russia's population decreasing)  Russia's population has been decreasing for over 20 years; Russians die younger and have few children. One author says this is because Russian society has learned to give up hope.  If that is true &mdash; I don't take it as certain &mdash; then it probably relates to the cruel capitalism that took over Russia in 1991. The same thing might happen in the US if the plutocrats cement their power.  09 September 2014 (NY thugs get creative for arrest)  New York thugs got creative to find an excuse to arrest a woman who had left a protest, as she waited near a restaurant for her family to come out of the toilet.  09 September 2014 (UK immigration prison death)  A UK immigration prison appears to have killed a prisoner by doing nothing when he reported chest pains. When his relatives asked what happened, they were told he had committed suicide.  09 September 2014 (Killed by thugs after traffic stop)  Illinois thugs have refused to tell Joshua Paul's family any details of why and how they killed him.  09 September 2014 (Death penalty unjustified)  In 1994, Justice Scalia cited two cases as examples that the death penalty could be incontrovertibly justified. One of them was the case of the two men just proved innocent by DNA evidence.  08 September 2014 (Urgent: Oppose enlarging pipeline)  US citizens: call on Obama and Kerry not to let Enbridge double the size of the Alberta Clipper tar oil pipeline.  Also submit a public comment to the State Department.  08 September 2014 (Zero-carbon-emissions society)  To avoid disaster, we should convert with all possible speed to a zero-carbon-emissions society.  I have to comment on some minor points.  It is a shame to cite Bill Gates as a positive example of anything. If the point is valid, it can be established without mentioning him. I distrust carbon offset schemes because many of them make presumptions about future activities that may not come true.  But these do not invalidate the article's conclusion. They only affect side issues.  08 September 2014 (Natural gas in Ukraine)  Ukraine has lots of natural gas that could make it an ideal target for fracking, especially if it is in debt to the IMF and can't resist.  The article erects a large superstructure of theories which I think are strained and not convincing.  08 September 2014 (US widening air bombing in Iraq)  The US is widening its air bombing intervention in Iraq.  As long as it remains limited to giving close air support to a local ground army fighting in a non-urban battlefield, the harm to civilians will be limited too. If it goes beyond that, it could become the sort of hatred-generator that drone attacks in Pakistan and Yemen have been.  08 September 2014 (The Rise of the Warrior Cop)  The Rise of the Warrior Cop describe the horror felt in the early US about mixing the roles of army and police, and how Nixon's "War on Dregs" started to endorse mixing them up.  08 September 2014 (Estonian investigator kidnaped)  Russian troops or thugs kidnaped an Estonian investigator from a customs office on Estonian territory; the former KGB now claims he was captured in Russia.  08 September 2014 (Anti-slavery activist on trial)  Anti-slavery activist Andy Hall has gone on trial in Thailand as punishment for a stellar career of defending the rights of migrant workers.  08 September 2014 (Voter ID laws)  Judge Posner said his ruling in favor of voter ID laws was wrong.  The ruling, which disenfranchised over 70,000 black voters in one state still threatens US democracy.  There are too many activities in the US which require a government-issued ID card, and this threatens to turn state driver-or-equivalent licenses into the equivalent of a national ID card.  08 September 2014 (If Israel wants security)  For Israel, the Beginning of Wisdom Is to Admit Its Mistakes. If Israel wants security, it should stop the policies that insure Palestine can't have any security.  08 September 2014 (Human rights defenders arrested in Qatar)  Qatar has admitted arresting two foreign human rights defenders who were investigating slavery in Qatar.  The delay in announcing this shows that the government hoped the world would not notice, and that the "illegalities", if not fabricated, are violations of laws Qatar will be ashamed to have.  08 September 2014 (Nigera imposing biometric ID cards)  Nigeria is imposing biometric ID cards that include fingerprints and iris scans. And share all the data with Mastercard.  National ID cards such as this are inherently oppressive  07 September 2014 (Abottt campaign promises)  Abbott is betting that if he repeats over and over that he did not break his campaign promises, voters will forget that he did.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Defend network neutrality)  US citizens: if you haven't already, submit a comment to the FCC defending network neutrality.  07 September 2014 (Debates between right-wing pundits that all agree)  Mainstream US TV political shows present debates between right-wing pundits that all agree the US should launch all-out war against ISIS.  "Three things that won't defeat Isis are a kneejerk reaction to the videos of western hostages being killed, going back to the old models of dictatorship and airstrikes."  Above all, it is necessary to show Iraqi Sunnis how they can have a government they generally won't feel is their enemy.  Perhaps that requires offering to break up Iraq, so they can have their own government as long as it isn't warlike.  07 September 2014 (Kidnaped journalists)  Many journalists have been kidnaped in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Secrecy in many individual cases has hidden the size of the problem.  07 September 2014 (NATO)  NATO: Part of Solution [in Ukraine] &mdash; Or Problem.  I think the question is not quite right. Nato expansion has clearly contributed to provoking Russia, but that doesn't prevent NATO from being useful for resisting Russia. Putin is not an innocent good guy, he is a former KGB officer.  07 September 2014 (If the bank doesn't make you homeless, thugs might try)  In Philadelphia, if the bank doesn't make you homeless, the thugs might try it.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act)  US citizens: support the Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act.  07 September 2014 (Atheist fanatics)  Violent religious fanatics are a real danger, but there are no violent atheist fanatics nowadays. The closest thing you can find are a few Communist dictatorships. They are cited to create a false appearance of moral equivalence between secularism and religion.  People do not need religion in order to treat each other well. Humans (except sociopaths) have a conscience as a matter of instinct, and can train it through reflection. It can even have the strength to prevail over religious immorality.  A story from Samoa (*) says that the religious practice of human sacrifice was ended when the son of the Malietoa (one of the top-level chiefs) saw that the woman he loved was going to be sacrificed, and presented himself for the sacrifice in place of her. The Malietoa, rather than sacrifice his son, banned human sacrifice thenceforth. Whether or not this really occurred, the repetition of the story shows that a human society can value conscience over religion, and it makes an instructive contrast with the story of Abraham and Isaac.  * From Les religions du Pacifique et d'Australie by Nevermann, Worms, and Petri.  07 September 2014 (US rate of job generation)  The US rate of job generation fell to a new low, less than ever since the 1970s.  The 1970s is the last time we had a government that represented Americans other than the elites.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Hold a rally for network neutrality)  In the US: hold a rally for network neutrality.  07 September 2014 (FBI censors Justice Dept. report)  The Justice Department's Inspector General released a report about how the FBI can bypass new "guidelines" about getting journalists' phone records and other data, but the FBI censored it so badly that all we know is that it's a secret.  07 September 2014 (Eritrean refugee gets asylum in UK)  An Eritrean, imprisoned because of his religious sect, took 3 years to reach Britain, where he received asylum.  He had to fend off kidnapers in Sudan, which also lets the Eritrean agents seize Eritrean refugees.  One thing I do not understand is why he snuck into the UK from Calais rather than asking for asylum in France. What is the attraction or advantage of the UK for a person who has a valid claim to asylum? Does anyone know?  07 September 2014 (Facebook's "curated" newsfeed)  Twitter told people about protests and thug violence in Ferguson (those who are interested), while Facebook mostly steered people away.  07 September 2014 (ISIS torturer shoots four at Jewish Museum)  An ISIS torturer went to Brussels and shot four people at the Jewish Museum.  Why it would be a mistake to discourage jihadis from western countries from returning home if they have changed their mind about the issue.  07 September 2014 (Fast-food striker's motivation)  One fast-food striker explains how he chose to get arrested for his daughter's sake.  07 September 2014 (Making thugs wear cameras)  Making thugs wear cameras is not an automatic guaranteed solution to thuggishness. They tend to turn off their cameras when they shoot people &mdash; and the cameras can contribute to massive general surveillance. Careful rules are needed.  07 September 2014 (Australia's threatened species)  The Australian government wants to delegate protection of threatened species to the states, which are not in a position to do it properly even if they wanted to.  Of course, the point of the change is that the states don't even want to try.  07 September 2014 (US pressuring Canada to seize medicines)  The US is pressuring Canada to seize generic medicines in transit on behalf of patentholding pharma companies.  These laws are murderous; officials who carry out such seizures should be tried in the ICC.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Do more than weakly criticize Israel's continued land-grab)  US citizens: tell Kerry it is time to do more than weakly criticize Israel's continued land-grab in Palestine.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Support journalists' freedom to report)  US citizens: support journalists' freedom to report.  07 September 2014 (Urgent: Stop selling off people's mortgages)  US citizens: Tell the Department of Housing to stop selling off people's mortgages to the same sort of "securitized" market that screwed them.  06 September 2014 (UK Green Party opposes plutocracy)  The UK Green Party is broadening its concerns to include opposing plutocracy.  It could replace the former UK Labour Party, which has transformed itself into a center-right party on economic issues.  06 September 2014 (Sierra Leone "lockdown")  Sierra Leone has declared a four-day "lockdown" in about two weeks to try to halt the spread of Ebola.  I think the need is sufficient to justify such a measure, but is it likely to work?  06 September 2014 (Abbott's attacks against environment)  Abbott treats Australia's environment as an enemy. These are his ten worst attacks against the environment.  06 September 2014 (Arrest at Moral Mondays protest)  At a Moral Mondays protest, thugs arrested a black politician for handing out voting rights leaflets (which is not a crime).  Right-wing Americans don't want people of minority groups to be able to vote, and in many states have passed laws designed to stop them.  06 September 2014 (Cell phone "interceptors")  Cell phone "interceptors", special modified cell towers, can take over a phone through the back door in the baseband processor.  06 September 2014 (ISIS barbarity)  ISIS waterboarded its captives.  What a shame it is to America to have set an example of barbarity for barbarians. The US must punish its torturers, starting with Bush.  As for the prisoners that can't be put on trial because torture taints the case against them, we must release them! So what if they go to ISIS or some affiliate of al Qa'ida? They won't add much to the strength of those organizations, but releasing them is crucial for the moral strength of the US.  06 September 2014 (Fast food workers' strike)  State representatives and even a congresswoman joined in fast food workers' strike protests.  06 September 2014 (Koch Operative)  Koch Operative: Raise the [minimum] Wage, Totalitarianism and Terrorism Follow?  06 September 2014 (UK cuts funds for food inspection)  The UK has cut funds for inspection of food and prosecution of food fraud to the point where fraud is easy and profitable. That's the Tory philosophy: make crime pay, when business wants it to.  06 September 2014 (Reducing militarization of thugs)  In San Jose, California, the thug department decided to act a little more like a police department, by getting rid of the armored repression vehicles that the US government gave it.  In Davis, it was the city council that made this wise decision, over the opposition of the thugs.  06 September 2014 (Harmful educational reform)  The supporters of harmful educational reform are asking for a less polarized discussion.  That's what right-wingers say when they are in the driver's seat and the people are getting angry enough to kick them out.  06 September 2014 (Urgent: Support fast food workers)  In the US: support the fast food workers strike.  06 September 2014 (Urgent: Oppose drilling in Beaufort Sea)  US citizens: oppose oil drilling in the Beaufort Sea, off the coast of the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge.  06 September 2014 (US oil production rising)  US oil production is rising, due to extraction of shale oil, and short-sighted politicians are claiming this is a good thing.  06 September 2014 (Bombing kills a leader of al-Shabaab)  A US bombing killed a leader of al-Shabaab.  I predict this will have as little effect as the killing of the previous leader. These groups don't depend on one person.  06 September 2014 (Collapse of case against Kenyatta)  The ICC case against Uhuru Kenyatta has collapsed because Kenya's refusal to cooperate has prevented collecting evidence.  06 September 2014 (Cease fire in Ukraine holding)  The cease fire in Ukraine is holding so far.  06 September 2014 (Towns controlled by Boko Haram)  Boko Haram has seized towns and held them, and the Nigerian army is not fighting back very well.  06 September 2014 (Blue whale population recovery)  The blue whales of California have recovered their numbers almost to pre-whaling levels, thanks to lots of protection efforts.  However, globally the blue whale population is only around 2% of what it was 140 years ago.  06 September 2014 (Defeating ISIS)  Obama says he wants to destroy ISIS, but will not escalate until there is an Iraqi army that is strong enough to win with help.  This means he is rejecting the pressure to do something rash and foolish.  However, he is straining the limits of the War Powers Act to the breaking point.  ISIS propaganda videos are designed to recruit individual supporters by making ISIS look tough and harsh.  It is a mistake to go to war because ISIS killed two Americans, or because ISIS kills people in a barbaric way. As has been pointed out, Saudi Arabia frequently kills people by beheading, and the practice is just as barbaric there.  The murder of thousands of Iraqis and Syrians, and religious oppression of those that live, are much bigger reasons to fight ISIS, but only if that is likely to be effective.  Could it be effective? This article, although it frames the issue in terms of "what do we need in order to win" rather than "does the approach make sense", points out that defeating ISIS is unlikely unless it is done by a more powerful army which is determined to fight and defeat ISIS, and which can cut off ISIS from its supply of recruits.  A foreign army would tend rather to boost ISIS recruiting as a reaction, while the Iraqi army lacks the commitment that could enable it to win.  06 September 2014 (Children facing physical violence)  60% of the world's children face regular physical violence, in many cases from their parents.  06 September 2014 (Israel plans more houses in colonies)  Israel has announced plans for 300 more houses in its colonies in Palestinian territory.  06 September 2014 (Data brokers)  A new data broker offers to pay people directly for their personal data.  Datacoup's existence by itself will not eliminate ordinary data brokers; something more is required. Supposing that something more appears, and other data brokers disappear, how much better will this be?  I would not give any data to the services that Datacoup works with. In fact, the only one of them I might consider using is Twitter, precisely because one doesn't have to give real personal data to it.  Therefore, I would not be interested in making such data available for a mere $10 or $100 or $1000 a month.  06 September 2014 (Policies that keep poor people out)  US inner-ring suburbs such as Ferguson are full of blacks, partly because other suburban towns have adopted policies to keep poor people out.  Zoning laws are a big source of injustice, and play a major role in the high cost of renting housing in the US. I think we need to invalidate some aspects of zoning laws in a broad fashion.  06 September 2014 (Using TTIP to bully the EU)  The TTIP is providing an excuse for companies to bully the EU to accept GMO food imports.  Modern free exploitation treaties, since the one that created the WTO, are harmful by nature. Politicians that endorse the project of making a new free exploitation treaties have their hearts in the wrong place.  06 September 2014 (Fads for unusual pets)  Movies trigger fads for unusual pets, which get abandoned by the dozens or hundreds a few years later.  05 September 2014 (Activists protesting thug militarization conference)  Activists in Oakland and San Francisco are protesting the "Urban Shield" thug militarization conference.  05 September 2014 (Revitalizing the union movement)  Fast-food strikes are revitalizing the union movement in the US.  05 September 2014 (Russian TV Shows Funeral of Soldier Killed 'On Leave')  Russian TV Shows Funeral of Soldier Killed 'On Leave' in Ukraine.  05 September 2014 (Lessons to draw from the Ashya King case)  Lessons to draw from the Ashya King case.  05 September 2014 (Torture)  A country can't admit torture was committed and then fail to do anything about it. Unless it is ruled by the Obama regime.  05 September 2014 (Accused of Promoting Feminist Views)  Iranian Women's Magazine Editor Accused of Promoting Feminist Views.  05 September 2014 (Fighting ISIS by making it look ridiculous)  Fighting ISIS by making it look ridiculous.  The Arab World's Version of the Ice Bucket Challenge: Burning ISIS Flags.  05 September 2014 (Human rights activists disappeared by gov't)  Human rights activists investigating enslavement of workers in Qatar appear to have been disappeared by the government.  05 September 2014 (Cradle-To-Prison pipeline)  The downtrodden parts of the US systematically direct youth into prison, but some forms of aid have shown they can break the cradle-to-prison pipeline.  We also have an obligation to end the systems that constitute the pipeline: running the economy to keep most Americans poor, racist thugs, the War on Drugs, and thugs in schools shoving students into the school-to-prison pipeline.  05 September 2014 (Seattle activists blocked a train line)  Seattle activists blocked a train line to protest the transport of oil by train through their state.  05 September 2014 (Refuges for women experiencing domestic violence)  Refuges for women experiencing domestic violence are necessary so they don't have to stay with their abusers.  Closing them down is part of the right-wing "family values" agenda, which values compelling people to be in families rather than the people as people.  05 September 2014 (Global heating and the plutocratic world order)  Naomi Klein: global heating and the plutocratic world order are hitting the world at the same time. This means either disaster or perhaps opportunity.  The plutocrats will seek to use the effects of global heating for shock capitalism, so as to drive most people in developed world into desperation such as we haven't seen since the 1930s. If ending plutocratic rule is necessary to avoid disaster, maybe that will spur people to do it  Naomi, please don't call the plutocrats and their supporters "Liberals". A Liberal is someone like me, or (to cite a leader of Liberals) someone like FDR.  05 September 2014 (Hamid Kehazaei was apparently killed by Australia)  Asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei was apparently killed by Australia, which sent him to an offshore prison in which prisoners got bad and delayed medical treatment.  05 September 2014 (Ukraine and Russia-lead rebels agreed to cease-fire)  Ukraine and Russia-lead rebels have agreed to a cease-fire.  The defeats suffered by Ukraine's forces, after weeks of slowly gaining, seem to prove by themselves that Russia gave the rebels armor, if not troops as well. Therefore, I don't think Putin is willing to let the matter end here.  05 September 2014 (BP guilty of "gross negligence")  Billionaire Polluters will have to pay Billions in Penalties after a judge ruled BP guilty of "gross negligence" in the Big Spill.  05 September 2014 (Abott the suppository of false promises)  Abbott continued right up to the Australian election a year ago being the suppository of false promises.  05 September 2014 (Stopping the Ebola outbreak)  Stopping the Ebola outbreak will cost half a billion dollars and take up to 9 months.  That's if we commit the resources now.  05 September 2014 (Let Down By the Law)  Ashya King Case Shows How Parents Can Be Let Down by the Law.  05 September 2014 (Dalai Lama barred from South Africa)  South Africa barred entry to the Dalai Lama &mdash; again.  05 September 2014 ("Playable city")  The idea of a "playable city".  05 September 2014 (Practices of Ferguson thugs)  The US government will investigate the practices of Ferguson thugs, in general as well as relating to the killing of Michael Brown.  In Ferguson, if you're black and not rich, simply driving is enough to get you fined over and over, and jailed because you can't pay.  05 September 2014 (Violation by Koch-funded organization)  A Koch-funded organization appears to have violated IRS regulations on electioneering in 2012.  Will Obama and Holder bestir themselves to have this investigated?  05 September 2014 (Pennsylvania facilitating fracking)  Pennsylvania, to facilitate fracking, has gutted its inspection system and rushed the approval of projects.  05 September 2014 (Google's support for ALEC)  50 organizations have called on Google to stop supporting ALEC.  Google claims its motto is "Don't be evil", but there is little in US politics that is more evil than ALEC.  05 September 2014 (Urgent: Reverse the Citizens United decision)  US citizens: phone your senators to urge them to vote for the constitutional amendment to reverse the Citizens United decision.  Although the amendment being considered is narrow,and won't abolish the idea that corporations are entitled to human rights, it is important nonetheless. The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  05 September 2014 (Living from paycheck to paycheck)  75% of Americans are living from paycheck to paycheck, unable to save any money.  14% have had trouble getting food at some time in the past year.  03 September 2014 (Evidence of Russian troops in Ukraine)  Some US intelligence whistleblowers say they distrust the claim that Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine.  Here is the evidence I've seen that Russia has sent troops to fight in Ukraine.  It does not all come from the US or NATO.  03 September 2014 (Rich spending more on election)  Due to the Supreme Court's "rich people's money is speech" McCutcheon decision, 300 rich people have already spent 11 million dollars more on this year's election than previous limits permitted.  03 September 2014 (Tories try to hamstring charities)  The Tories are trying to hamstring organizations such as Oxfam so they cannot campaign for hungry people there.  03 September 2014 (Spread of phony abortion counsellors)  Phony abortion counsellors that give false information have spread from the US to Australia.  03 September 2014 (Greenpeace India funding)  The Indian government blocked foreign funding for Greenpeace India, but a court reversed the decision.  Evidently Modi's government wants mining companies to trash India.  03 September 2014 (CVS discontinuing sale of cigarettes)  CVS is discontinuing sale of cigarettes.  03 September 2014 (Lobbying against GM labelling)  Opponents of GM Labelling Triple Lobbying Spending in 2014.  03 September 2014 (Worse off today than under Dubya)  In a Lot of Ways, We're Worse Off Today Than We Were under George W. Bush.  03 September 2014 (Gulf of Maine hit by global heating)  Global heating is hitting the Gulf of Maine hard, driving many species northward.  03 September 2014 (Prison next to coal ash dump)  Pennsylvania put a prison next to a coal ash dump, and the prisoners are getting diseases from that.  03 September 2014 (Great Barrier Reef still threatened)  Australia has been pressured into cancelling the plan to dump waste from dredging a new coal port straight into the Great Barrier Reef. However, the export of coal from that port will still gravely threaten the reef.  03 September 2014 (What AT&amp;T wants)  AT&amp;T Wants Tax Incentives And State Laws That Protect It from Competition.  Since cables running down the street are a natural monopoly, they should be be owned either by tightly regulated businesses or directly by the state.  03 September 2014 (Commenting on a candidate's appearance)  Commenting on a female candidate's appearance, whether positively or negatively or neutrally, tends to harm the candidate's success in the race. Pointing out that this is a side issue, and what matters is the candidate's politics, cancels out that effect.  In this context, it is interesting to note the way other senators commented disparagingly on the appearance of Senator Gillibrand.  03 September 2014 ("Fast food" staff strike)  Staff in "fast food" restaurants in several US states plan to go on strike on Sep 4 and protest outside restaurants.  Remember that "fast food" was not supposed to be eaten. It was originally intended for fasting.  04 September 2014 (ISIS getting desperate)  ISIS published another beheading video.  ISIS is really desperate to get the US more involved in fighting.  04 September 2014 (Therapy of LSD)  How conservative prejudice cut off the promising therapy of LSD.  04 September 2014 (Help block a pipeline for fracked gas)  Citizens of New York State, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts: help block a pipeline for fracked gas.  04 September 2014 (Israel sabotaged the Palestinian Authority)  Israel sabotaged the Palestinian Authority by not passing on the tax revenues it collects on the PA's behalf.  04 September 2014 (UK thugs secretly checked a journalist's phone records)  UK thugs secretly checked a journalist's phone records without a warrant.  This was to identify a whistleblower in the thug department.  The thugs refuse to say how many times they have done this.  04 September 2014 (Tax dodging and corruption)  Tax dodging and corruption cost the world's poorest countries 20 billion dollars in tax revenue, or maybe more if the tax rate were what it should be.  The US government (and US citizens) suffer from this too.  03 September 2014 (Tasmania has permitted logging)  Tasmania has permitted logging in 1500 square miles of currently protected forests.  They claim that this is justified by "creating jobs", which is standard bullshit for right-wing governments that decide to loot the environment. (The same has been said to argue for the Keystone XL pipeline.) Of course, the same right-wing governments destroy far more jobs through austerity. Take away a lot, give back a little while screwing you, and say you should be grateful.  I do not consider trees sacred. If most of the Earth's wild forests were still here, it would make sense to cut parts of them, just not too much. But we've already come close to wiping out many ecosystems, and now it is time to stop.  As we get closer to catastrophe, the money pressure attacking every protected area or possible resource will grow. The plutocrats who hope to profit will promise trickle-down to some of the masses they have made desperate, so as to get them to support the looting. By the time civilization can no longer support the sort of trade that makes it profitable to cut down forests and ship the wood across the world, we may have wiped out every last bit of forest in the final frenzy.  Mining threatens to poison the Scandinavian Arctic.  03 September 2014 (Questions North Carolina thugs must answer)  Five questions North Carolina thugs must answer about the two teenagers they framed for murder.  03 September 2014 (Judge rejects release of torture photos)  A judge rejected release of photos of Mohammed al-Qahtani, because seeing how he was tortured might make people angry at the US.  Wouldn't all criminals love to be able to use that argument.  03 September 2014 (EU requiring better energy efficiency)  The EU is requiring improved efficiency from electric appliances, and right-wing media are trying to make a scandal out of it.  03 September 2014 (TTIP would ban undoing privatization of NHS)  The UK government has had to admit that that the TTIP would ban undoing the privatization of the NHS. Its whole purpose is to put companies over the public.  Is there any major party in the UK that opposes the TTIP? Please tell me if you know.  03 September 2014 (Global heating tied to droughts)  Advances in climate modelling have tied global heating to long droughts including the current drought in California.  03 September 2014 (Uber banned in Germany)  In Germany, Uber has been renamed Unter: it is banned. However, not for the sake of passengers' privacy.  03 September 2014 (False murder convictions)  Two convicted murderers in North Carolina may be freed now that DNA evidence shows the real killer was someone else.  The thugs bullied the teenagers into confessing, then hid evidence that would have proved their innocence. Egregiously, the thugs seem to have actively blocked investigation of the real killer at the time. (Don't let inconvenient facts get in the way of the preferred theory.)  It's as if the thugs were out to get those two teenagers, but why? I don't know, but I can guess a possible explanation. Is it possible that the teenagers were black and the real murderer was white?  Will the detectives that committed this vicious act be put on trial?  03 September 2014 (Curbing long-term global heating)  Some policies to reduce long-term global heating can increase short-term global heating. This is because they reduce CO2 emissions but increase methane emissions.  This issue becomes important if humanity gets its act together to reduce CO2 emissions enough to curb long-term global heating. If humanity fails to do so, as now appears likely, then this issue will only slightly change the timing of disaster.  03 September 2014 (Traffic ticket quota in Florida)  A few Florida thugs listened to their consciences and reported that their chief was illegally giving them a quota for traffic tickets.  Will the chief be prosecuted? Will the tickets be refunded and the license points taken off?  03 September 2014 (Global heating disaster meeting)  India and China have announced they will downgrade their participation in the last-ditch meeting to try to avoid global heating disaster.  03 September 2014 (Increased racism in Israel)  A Palestinian citizen of Israel, well accustomed to second-class citizenship, reports on the wave of increased racism and repression.  Widely repeated death threats against Arabs go unchecked, while Arabs that make sober criticism of war get fired or arrested.  03 September 2014 (Boycott of Israeli products)  The boycott of Israeli products is getting strong enough to make Israeli businesses pressure the government.  03 September 2014 (Urgent: Pass the Voting Rights Amendments Act)  US citizens: Call on Congress to pass the Voting Rights Amendments Act.  03 September 2014 (The winners and the losers of the latest battle in Gaza)  The winners and the losers of the latest battle in Gaza.  03 September 2014 (Israeli soldier shot Palestinian teenager in the head)  An Israeli soldier shot a Palestinian teenager in the head with a rubber-coated steel bullet, fracturing his skull.  This does not happen by accident: the soldiers are good shots, and the teenager was not expecting violence, so he was probably walking in a steady, predictable way.  03 September 2014 (Israeli army used Palestinian civilian as human shield)  The Israeli army took a Palestinian civilian hostage, then used him as a human shield, forcing him to search buildings for tunnels.  Israel repeatedly accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields but there is no evidence this ever occurred.  03 September 2014 (Collusion and lying among thugs)  The UK has exposed collusion and lying among the thugs that accused an important Tory politician of calling them "fucking plebs".  Such collusion and lying is commonplace among thugs, to cover up other nasty things such as killing an innocent person. The system is set up to take it for truth &mdash; unless the victim is an important right-wing politician.  03 September 2014 (Barcelona faces an excess of tourism)  Barcelona faces the problem of an excess of tourism, which threatens to force the residents out of the city, as a local consequence of broader problems: corruption and the debt-collecting government of occupation.  03 September 2014 (Health systems have collapsed in West Africa)  Medecins Sans Frontieres says military medical teams are needed in West Africa because health systems have collapsed. Infectious corpses are rotting in the streets and treatable diseases are killing people.  The absence of medical care could kill a lot more people than Ebola is killing now. The panic could become worse than a civil war.  Liberian nurses have gone on strike because they don't have proper equipment to protect them from catching Ebola from their patients.  Shouldn't the US donate this equipment?  03 September 2014 (Collapse into global poverty)  40 years later, data vindicate the Limits to Growth study, suggesting that civilization is nearing the start of a collapse into global poverty.  02 September 2014 (Easing Restrictions on Gaza)  Easing Restrictions on Gaza Won't Create Conditions for Normal Life Or Offer Any Economic Or Diplomatic Horizon.  02 September 2014 (Governor Walker target of campaign violations investigation)  Proof that Wisconsin Governor Walker is indeed a target of the campaign violations investigation that a crony judge has halted.  02 September 2014 (Urgent: Employee Empowerment Act)  US citizens: call on Congress to pass the Employee Empowerment Act, which would make it illegal to discriminate against employees for trying to organize a union.  02 September 2014 (Neural modulators)  The US is developing tiny neural modulators as implants to modify the function of particular nerves in the brain.  I am suspicious of the idea of using this to treat arthritis. Arthritis is not a brain condition; it is a disorder of joints. A neural modulator might alter the sensation of pain from arthritis but that would not make the joint any better. It might over time do just the opposite.  02 September 2014 (Smoothing the way for mining projects)  Ahead of proposing mining projects in northern Australia, the Australian government is cutting funds for monitoring environmental damage there.  02 September 2014 (Weather forecasts for 2050)  Sample weather forecasts for 2050 might show people what global heating means in practice.  Remember that 2100 will be much worse than 2050.  Our reality resembles the film, The Day the Earth Caught Fire, though not at the same speed.  I think the writer doesn't really understand science fiction; he thinks it is supposed to be a comment on our world. As a famous critic (was it Samuel Delaney?) pointed out, people who don't really understand science fiction tend to perceive it as allegory, a comment on something else, rather than a fictional world in which the events described happen. This is the heart of science fiction.  I once heard a song on the radio that talked about birds' disappearing in the sky. What an alarming idea! I recall imagining what I'd ask if I saw that really happen. Were they being destroyed, or transported elsewhere? What's the cause &mdash; a natural phenomenon, a technological accident, a weapon? Would it get me next?  Then I realized the song did not mean it literally, only that the birds were flying off into the distance. How pedestrian! Their disappearance would have been far more interesting.  This made me realize that I have a science-fictional way of understanding a story.  02 September 2014 (UN to investigate ISIS atrocities)  The UN will try to investigate atrocities committed by ISIS, and lesser atrocities committed by the Iraqi government army.  02 September 2014 (Hong Kong legislators protest)  Hong Kong legislators protested as China's representative declared that only submissive candidates would be allowed in Hong Kong.  02 September 2014 (New Spanish Pun)  New pun  anteojos para dormir.  02 September 2014 (Urgent: Pay workers a living wage)  Everyone: call on Dunkin Donuts to pay workers a living wage.  02 September 2014 (Farm guards acquitted of shooting Bangladeshi farm workers)  Farm guards in Greece were acquitted, incredibly, of shooting Bangladeshi farm workers who were protesting that they had been denied their pay.  The farmer owners exploit these migrant workers rather than pay a Greek worker decent wages. I would support the Greek government completely in deporting the migrant workers &mdash; and prosecuting the farmers for hiring them. But that is no justification for denying them their pay, let alone for shooting them.  02 September 2014 (Urgent: End to funding militarization of thugs)  US citizens: call for an end to funding militarization of thugs.  02 September 2014 (Madly overzealous UK thugs)  Madly overzealous UK thugs had the King family arrested in Spain for taking their sick child out of a hospital, hoping to give him a different treatment elsewhere.  It appears doctors disagree about whether the proton beam treatment they hope to give Ashya King might help him. (See the end of the article.) In any case, the hospital he was in had given up hope for saving him, so there was nothing to lose by trying another treatment except what it would cost.  The hospitals that say the proton beam treatment is better might have been exaggerating to get business. Or it might be true.  Whether it is true or not, whether it saves Ashya King or not, it is clear that his parents were acting responsibly to try to care for him. The accusations of neglect, used to get them arrested in Spain, are impossible to justify.  It appears that the European arrest warrant was issued without a valid legal basis.  02 September 2014 (Coal mining licenses in India)  Modi's government wants to preserve some of the coal mining licenses that were issued corruptly.  Even if a mine is ready to produce, that is no obstacle to requiring the mine license to be auctioned properly to buyers.  There is also the separate and vital environmental issue of whether India ought to burn so much coal.  02 September 2014 (Thousands of Russian soldiers sent to places near Ukraine)  Thousands of Russian soldiers were sent to places near Ukraine, then stopped communicating with their families.  Hundreds have turned up killed in combat, and the government refuses to say where they died.  The only plausible explanation is that they have been sent into Ukraine to fight.  I find it amusing that people who (rightly) distrust what the US government says about its own military operations are willing to believe what Putin says about his.  02 September 2014 (Don't blame low-paid working mothers)  Don't blame low-paid working mothers for bringing along children to help.  Instead, blame the cruel right-wing politicians that make laws that make this the best option those mothers have available.  02 September 2014 (Urgent: Call on Dole to intervene to protect Andy Hall)  Everyone: call on Dole to intervene to protect Andy Hall, who reported on slavery in pineapple production in Thailand.  Here is more information.  01 September 2014 (Urgent: An excuse to avoid punishment for rape)  Everyone: call on Algeria and Tunisia to stop accepting marriage as an excuse to avoid punishment for rape.  01 September 2014 (Erdogan has continued to arrest Turkish thugs)  Erdogan has continued to arrest the Turkish thugs that are connected with trying to prosecute ministers for corruption.  01 September 2014 (Seizure of land near Bethlehem)  The US rebuked Israel for seizing Palestinian land near Bethlehem.  Israel admits that this seizure of land is meant as a collective punishment of Palestinians for a crime they have nothing to do with.  01 September 2014 (Dehumanization by Israeli society)  Israeli society is increasingly flooded with dehumanization of Palestinians and threats/advocacy of sexual violence.  01 September 2014 (Pentagon cover-ups)  The Pentagon has repeatedly covered up flaws in its weapons, flaws that kill US troops, and punishes the whistleblowers that reveal them.  01 September 2014 (ISIS and al-Nusra's funding)  ISIS and al-Nusra continue to get lots of funding from people in Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  Those states may not be funding them directly, but they permit it to go on.  01 September 2014 (Urgent: Call on the Vatican to divest from fossil fuels)  Everyone: call on the Vatican to divest from fossil fuels.  01 September 2014 (Urgent: Your candidates on abortion rights)  Massachusetts citizens: see how your candidates stand on abortion rights.  01 September 2014 (Bill requiring students to explicitly ask for sex before doing so)  California is about to pass a bill that in effect requires college students to explicitly ask "Do you want to have sex?" before doing so.  The article does not make it clear that this law will regulate how colleges handle accusations of sexual assault &mdash; not students directly.  However, it is so common for people to have sex without explicitly asking each other "Do you want to have sex now?" that I fear students will consider the requirement for "affirmative consent" ridiculous, and systematically ignore it, so that they will nearly all be technically guilty if the school ever investigates them.  Another point in the article, which makes the law seem unreasonable in a different way, describes it wrong. The law does not say that consent is invalid if "given under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs", as the article put it. Those words would seem to mean that if two people meet after drinking alcohol, and then have sex, then neither of them really consented &mdash; if the law said that. But the law really says that a person who is "incapacitated" by alcohol and/or drugs does not consent. That seems correct to me.  01 September 2014 (Systematic harassment of the poor)  The high rate of arrest warrants in Ferguson &mdash; more than 1.5 per year per inhabitant &mdash; is due to systematic harassment of the poor.  This is common across the US, and amounts to an additional tax on the consequences of poverty.  01 September 2014 (Thousands protested in Australia)  Thousands in Australia protested Abbott's war on children and young people.  01 September 2014 (Decline of wild salmon wiping out orcas)  The decline of wild salmon populations is slowly wiping out the orcas of Puget Sound.  01 September 2014 (Munitions that reduce the environmental damage of war)  Designing munitions that reduce the environmental damage of war.  This is the opposite of depleted uranium munitions.  01 September 2014 (Hong Kong citizens plan a massive protest)  Hong Kong citizens plan a massive protest after China rejected free elections in Hong Kong.  01 September 2014 (Babies are born at the 23rd week of pregnancy)  When babies are born at the 23rd week of pregnancy, out of those that survive, almost 90% will have a disability. Often very serious.  I think that implies a moral duty to abort these fetuses rather than let them become disabled babies.  01 September 2014 (Britain Accused of Conniving at Torture)  Britain Accused of Conniving at Torture of Maoists in Nepal's Civil War.  01 September 2014 (Islamist army terrifying residents)  The Islamist army that conquered Tripoli is also tied to particular Libyan tribes, and is terrifying residents connected with tribes it considers enemies.  01 September 2014 (NYT endorses not punishing killer thugs)  The New York Times endorses bending over backwards not to punish killer thugs.  The impunity is so complete that exceptions are very rare.  31 August 2014 (Microsoft dodging taxes)  Microsoft is playing the offshore game to dodge lots of taxes.  31 August 2014 (Australian man rejects Australian state)  An Australian of aboriginal origin has rejected the Australian state, its money, its passport, etc., as a symbolic act.  31 August 2014 (America's Real Foreign Policy)  Noam Chomsky: America's Real Foreign Policy.  It aims for security for state and plutocratic power, not for citizens.  31 August 2014 (Imposed poverty in the UK)  Imposed poverty in the UK has reached the point where children suffer from rickets, which is caused by a shortage of minerals or of vitamin D.  Vitamin D is made in the skin when it's exposed to sunlight, but the minerals must come from food.  31 August 2014 (Pacific Islands drowning)  The Pacific Islands Are Drowning, We Need the World's Help.  31 August 2014 (TTIP treaty back door)  The proposed TTIP treaty has a back door which could be used, afterwards, to cancel out food safety inspection.  31 August 2014 (Overloading the Earth)  Even though economic growth is no longer tied strictly to energy use increases, many human activities are pushing absolute resource limits.  Of course, our current way of doing things is not sustainable. But ceasing to overload the Earth does not inevitably mean we must be poor and deprived. That depends on whether the plutocrats take it all.  31 August 2014 (Court orders censorship of app)  A Brazilian court ordered Apple, Google and Microsoft to delete the Secret app (and a similar one) from their app stores.  Nobody should use that app; it is proprietary software, so the users don't control it and it may well be malware (as many proprietary programs are).  The Apple and Microsoft operating systems are proprietary and full of malware, too, as is Google Play which is part of Android.  Notwithstanding that, this court decision is oppression, pure and simple. But what makes the decision so damaging is that Apple and Microsoft have built censorship of apps into their operating systems. Now Brazil is using their censorship systems for its own purposes.  31 August 2014 (Power of the UK establishment)  In 1950, the UK establishment confronted democracy to maintain its power. Nowadays, it has achieved such superiority over democracy that there is nothing to restrain its power.  In the US, the confrontation dated from 1932 to 1980, and some details of the establishment are different, but the result is the same.  This is why none of the major parties proposes measures that would give poor Britons decent housing.  31 August 2014 (ISIS)  Kerry called for a "global coalition" to fight ISIS.  Fighting ISIS in a way that is effective in the long term is not such a simple thing. Previous interventions backfired, and ISIS is the result.  Although fighting ISIS can hurt it tactically, in the long term military opposition that enrages foreign Sunnis is what ISIS thrives on.  The leaders of ISIS seem to want to encourage a big US intervention, and that is why they publish provocative videos of real or pretended beheadings.  They also want to encourage Shi'ite hatred that will frighten Iraqi Sunnis.  31 August 2014 (GMOs get Clinton's full support)  Hillary Clinton went to a GMO convention and gave GMOs her full support, repeating the false talking points of the GMO companies.  30 August 2014 (Urgent: Vermont's GMO labeling law)  In the US: petition major organic dairies to drop out of the organization that is supporting the lawsuit to overturn Vermont's GMO labeling law.  30 August 2014 (Expressions of emotion)  Women report that men's verbal confrontation is occasionally followed by their physical aggression, often enough that the verbal confrontation makes them scared physical aggression will follow.  I don't understand those men's attitude towards women. It seems to be a mixture of desire, hatred and contempt. I have never felt that way towards anyone, but I am compelled by women's testimony to believe that some men do.  Nonetheless, expressions of emotion are not physical attacks. The two are not morally equivalent. If some insults lead to an assault, that doesn't mean an insult is as bad as an assault.  30 August 2014 (The War for Nothing)  Uri Avnery: The War for Nothing.  It is interesting that the rockets fired from Hamas, although they rarely injure a person, made life so unpleasant in the farms near the border of Gaza that people began to move away.  Israel has no right to order Gazans to stay away from the border on pain of being shot without warning. Israel does have the right to evacuate the land on its own side of the border. If Israel wants a buffer zone, that is the legitimate way to make one.  30 August 2014 (Prison sentence for redistributing movie)  A UK man was sentenced to about 3 years in prison for redistributing copies of a movie.  Someone pointed out that this is as much as the usual penalty for convicted rapists.  This redistribution was done commercially. I don't advocate legalization of commercial redistribution of copyrighted works without authorization. Works made to be used in a practical way should all be free but this was a work of fiction, not a functional work. So I don't think what Danks did has to be legalized.  However, the companies that the UK government caters to would have told it to jail him just the same if he had not tried to make one penny.  Please don't refer to unauthorized copying with the smear term, "piracy". Movie piracy is what you see in Captain Blood.  30 August 2014 (Foolish American overreactions)  Most Americans want it to be illegal to allow children to play outside alone.  This shows how far the American insanity about children has gone.  Another foolish overreaction: a foreign tourist who climbed a tower on the Brooklyn Bridge faces criminal charges. He is likely to be jailed for years before trial.  30 August 2014 (Canadian scientists silenced)  Canadian scientists are required to get 9 levels of approval before they can tell the public how much Arctic ice has melted.  30 August 2014 (Thugs knowingly jail wrong person)  The thugs knew Shannon Renee McNeal was the wrong person, and so did the court, but they insisted on jailing her anyway.  Anyone can make a mistake, but there should be zero tolerance for insisting on mistreating someone based on a mistake that has been recognized. All the people who did so should be fired.  30 August 2014 (Legalized medical marijuana)  States which had legalized medical marijuana, in 2010, had significantly fewer deaths from opioid pain-killers.  30 August 2014 (Money for Mugabe's terror campaign)  A US hedge fund appears to have given Mugabe the money for his terror campaign that undid the opposition's electoral victory.  30 August 2014 (Texas thug kills teenager)  A thug in Texas killed a teenager who reasonably thought the thug was an armed thief and tried to drive away. The thug faces no charges.  30 August 2014 (Executive Order 12333)  An executive order made by President Reagan, which ostensibly allows spying on foreigners, is used today mainly to collect data about Americans.  The article repeats the absurd nostrum that terrorists such as al Qa'ida threatened the existence of the US. This is a ridiculous exaggeration &mdash; what they could directly do was too small to eliminate the US, and the only way they could do great harm was if the US reacted self-destructively (which it did). Since this ridiculous exaggeration was the excuse for Dubya's attacks on US human rights, and on Iraq, we must not let it pass as true. We must refute it even when someone else mentions it only in passing.  President Reagan's other horrible things: He betrayed his country by supplying weapons to terrorists as ransom for the hostages they had taken. He attacked the non-rich, setting the US on the path towards today's plutocracy and expanding poverty.  30 August 2014 (Republican loyalty to money)  Republican candidates for the senate met with rich donors and confessed their undying gratitude and loyalty to the money.  30 August 2014 (Urgent: End corporate tax write-offs)  US citizens: call for an end to tax write-offs on penalties to corporations.  30 August 2014 (US thugs plan to deploy drones)  Many US thug departments are planning to deploy drones, perhaps with infrared cameras to see what the eye could not (such as, whether someone is home).  We certainly can't trust thugs to follow rules, or laws.  30 August 2014 (Social networks silence dissenters)  Some major social networks tend to silence a dissenting few, on any issue.  This is why it helps us greatly if you insist on calling the GNU/Linux system "GNU/Linux" and refuse to be intimidated by those who erroneously call it "Linux".  30 August 2014 (Pakistani TV station driven off air)  Intimidation by Imran Khan's opposition party is driving a Pakistani TV station mostly off the air.  30 August 2014 (Investigation of war crimes in Gaza)  The ICC says that it can investigate war crimes in Gaza if it gets a request from the government of Palestine.  I don't know whether it really needs that request or is passing the buck. I am sure the US is putting pressure on Palestine not to give the ICC jurisdiction.  30 August 2014 (ISIS uses waterboarding)  ISIS uses waterboarding on prisoners, following the US example.  30 August 2014 (Overestimation of terrorism danger)  Intelligence agencies have every reason to overestimate the danger of terrorism.  Not to mention that it provides an excuse to do to us what they want to do anyway: spy on everyone's communications and movements.  30 August 2014 (Ferguson thug department sued)  Ferguson protesters and bystanders attacked by thugs have sued the thug department for 40 million dollars.  I hope they win, but if they do, they will only get compensation from the city. The guilty won't be punished.  30 August 2014 (Urgent: Ditch ALEC)  US citizens: call on state officials to ditch ALEC.  30 August 2014 (US political "debate" shows)  On US TV, the political "debate" shows don't invite, or even mention, union leaders.  30 August 2014 (The libertarian ideology)  The libertarian ideology stubbornly opposes all solutions to problems such as public health and global heating.  30 August 2014 (US sanctions against Iran)  US sanctions against Iran continue to make necessary medicines unavailable there.  30 August 2014 (UK says Russia sent 80 tanks and lots of soldiers into Ukraine)  The UK says that Russia has sent 80 tanks and lots of soldiers into Ukraine.  30 August 2014 (Hong Kong has launched accusations of bribery)  Hong Kong has launched accusations of bribery against a media mogul that campaigns for democracy.  30 August 2014 (Plutocrats want socialism for them)  Plutocrats want the benefits of socialism for them, plus "small government" to strand the rest of us.  30 August 2014 (Number of manatees in Florida has increased greatly)  The number of manatees in Florida has increased greatly since they were protected, so the question is whether to designate them as "threatened" rather than "endangered".  A species can't survive if its habitat is wiped out. The US often protects one endearing endangered species as a way of protecting the whole ecosystem, including many other species, that it lives in. It seems that manatees are an example of this. The existing restrictions enable manatees to coexist with human water activities, but this redesignation would permit land development that could wipe out all of them.  30 August 2014 (E-Cigarettes Should Be Called 'Nicotine Sticks')  E-Cigarettes Should Be Called 'Nicotine Sticks' to Curb Appeal, Experts Say.  I suggest calling them "nicotine inhalers" and designing them to look like the inhalers for other drugs &mdash; totally un-cool.  29 August 2014 (Urgent: Oppose support for Monsanto)  US citizens: tell Hillary Clinton to stop supporting Monsanto and GMOs.  29 August 2014 (UN peacekeepers taken hostage)  Syrian rebels have taken UN peacekeepers hostage.  29 August 2014 (GMO industry trying to silence criticism)  The GMO industry is trying to get Reuters journalist Carey Gillam fired or transferred, part of a general pattern of trying to silence criticism.  29 August 2014 (Brain-eating amoeba)  Due to global heating, a brain-eating amoeba is spreading north from Louisiana.  Getting just one in your nose can be fatal.  29 August 2014 (Senate's torture investigation report)  Victims of US-managed kidnaping and torture call on Obama to release the Senate's torture investigation report.  29 August 2014 (Captured soldiers killed by ISIS)  ISIS killed 200 Syrian soldiers that it had captured, according to its supporters.  Even supposing the report is inaccurate, it shows what ISIS would like to do.  29 August 2014 (Prohibition on cohabitation overturned)  A prohibition on cohabitation, effectively Mormon polygamous marriages though not saying so, has been overturned in a court.  There is a secular polyamory community, which I support. We believe that polyamorous relationships are legitimate; we know they can be happy, and don't lead particularly to problems. I see no valid grounds for the prohibition that was just overturned.  However, the critics of Mormon polygamy say it is a system of oppression of women and children. Are they right? If so, how can those facts be reconciled with secular polyamorous experience? Are these relationships bad in a hidden way? Is there a crucial difference, that causes secular polyamory to have better results than Mormon ones? Is it a matter of different ways of judging whether a relationship is good or bad?  29 August 2014 (Warren on Israel's occupation)  Elizabeth Warren is right wing in regard to Israel's occupation of Palestine.  29 August 2014 (Export peace to Gaza)  Muslim and Jewish leaders in Britain say, let's export peace to Gaza.  29 August 2014 (Australia's spending on energy)  Australia's next offensive for the fossil fuel companies is to eliminate new spending on conversion to renewable energy.  29 August 2014 (Market Basket's old CEO returns)  Market Basket's old CEO, that customers and workers supported, has returned.  29 August 2014 (Estimated emissions from Keystone XL)  How the US government's basic error leads to underestimating the CO2 emissions from Keystone XL.  29 August 2014 (Renewable energy)  Renewable energy now generates 22% of electricity, but politicians are working hard to slow the growth rate.  When you compare the cost of renewable energy subsidies with the damage global heating will do, the former is clearly less. It's also much less than the fossil fuel subsidies, which the same politicians don't complain about. Clearly that cost is not the real reason.  I think the reason for this is fossil fuel company money.  29 August 2014 (Stepping on the downtrodden)  The Australian government's next excuse to step on the downtrodden: punishing those who miss a job interview.  29 August 2014 (Putin's covert war of conquest)  The Ukrainian army says that the Russian army has invaded and is attacking the city of Mariupol, after weeks of bombardment from Russian territory.  It appears that Putin has decided on a real covert war of conquest, not the provocation/distraction from Crimea that I thought this was.  29 August 2014 (Safety advice and victim-blaming)  Not all safety advice constitutes victim-blaming.  29 August 2014 (Whether to intervene in Iraq)  The question of whether to intervene in Iraq includes questions about what sort of intervention it would be, and with what goal.  29 August 2014 (Obama regimes' obedience to banksters)  The Obama regime, obedient to the banksters as usual, fined Goldman Sachs for fraud, but will allow Goldman Sachs to deduct the fine from its taxes and recover 1/3 of it.  29 August 2014 (Shaker Aamer beaten for protesting)  Shaker Aamer, held without charges in Guantanamo, is now being beaten daily by the guards as punishment for protesting his imprisonment.  29 August 2014 (US not obligated to fight in Syria)  Suggestion: the US has no more obligation to fight Assad in Syria than it has to fight the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, etc.  When Assad faced a campaign of peaceful protests for human rights, that campaign merited support on ethical grounds. Today's situation is totally different.  When a violent uprising started in parallel with that campaign, Assad said it was started by Islamists, and that may have been true. Once the fighting started, various Sunni groups, reportedly less fanatical, joined in; but they have been eclipsed by the jihadi groups funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  That the US does not have to fight all these dictators does not mean it must or should give them strong support, as it does now.  The reasons the US government has stated for supporting so many Arab dictators and monarchs are: to oppose the Soviet Union (obsolete), and to promote stability. Ironically, this practice has had the effect, across decades, of enabling Islamist fanatics to win the support of those who oppose the dictators and monarchs for other reasons.  29 August 2014 (The cease-fire in Gaza)  The indefinite cease-fire in Gaza includes some relaxation of the siege, but not entirely.  29 August 2014 (UK thugs' priorities)  The UK thugs didn't bother investigating the murder of Ricky Reel, apparently for racist motives, because they were too busy investigating his family as they campaigned for a proper investigation of the murder.  29 August 2014 (Universities)  Universities were once considered a way to benefit society by spreading learning and giving the non-rich a path to advance; now they mainly maintain the elite status quo.  29 August 2014 (Rate of killing by US thugs)  The US equivalent of Iraq Body Count has found that US thugs kill about 3 times as many people as the FBI reports &mdash; around 1100 a year.  29 August 2014 (War on drugs in Australia)  In an Australian state, one party proposes to escalate the war on drugs.  I think it is a bad idea to use methamphetamine, but the war on drugs does worse harm than the drugs.  29 August 2014 (New coal electric plants in Europe)  New coal-fired electric plants in Europe threatens to wipe out all its savings in CO2 emissions.  If solar power and more advanced batteries catch on, these plants will be lost investments. I suspect that the owners are getting a subsidy to build them, or a loan from the state that will never be repaid if the plants become unnecessary.  29 August 2014 (Urgent: Call on Burger King to drop tax dodging plan)  Everyone: call on Burger King to drop its tax dodging plan.  29 August 2014 (Urgent: Call for protection of monarch butterflies)  US citizens: call for protection of monarch butterflies, whose numbers have fallen by 90%.  Please don't distort the formerly useful word "decimate". It means killing ten percent of something. (The Romans used this as a punishment for military units that mutinied and then surrendered.) What we have done to the monarch butterflies is far worse than decimation.  29 August 2014 (Ban on GMOs in Kaua'i overturned)  The ban on GMOs in Kaua'i was overturned in court.  29 August 2014 (Net neutrality is "marxist")  A Koch brothers front group claims that net neutrality is "marxist".  The Koch brothers figure that any absurd claim will pass for true if they get enough organizations to say it often enough.  29 August 2014 (Three Vietnamese activists jailed)  Three Vietnamese activists who protested for democracy were jailed for "obstructing traffic".  Did Vietnam bring in thugs from Ferguson? This sounds awfully like what they did to some journalists.  29 August 2014 (UN reports on the atrocities in Syria)  The UN reports on the atrocities in Syria, committed by Assad's army and by ISIS.  29 August 2014 (Years-Late apology from thug department)  Protester Ellie Mae O'Hagan, CS gas sprayed by a wild thug for no reason says that the years-late apology from the thug department is no substitute for holding thugs accountable for their actions.  29 August 2014 (The War on Sharing)  The City of London has a police force that fights the War on Sharing, illegally.  The City of London is a small part of London that acts as a political arm of the banksters. It is the enemy of democracy.  29 August 2014 (UK social mobility)  The UK has very little no social mobility. Here are some of the causes.  The situation in the US is similar overall. Social mobility has gone way down since 50 years ago.  28 August 2014 (Declared a "security risk" for having sign on car)  A security guard in Australia was declared a "security risk" for having a sign on her car that criticized the danger of coal dust.  The greatest irony is that these ports endanger the security of Australians far more than any individual could.  28 August 2014 (Australia's record-breaking summer heat)  Global heating denialists claim Australia's record-breaking summer heat is a lie.  28 August 2014 (New Spanish Pun)  New pun in spanish.  27 August 2014 (Urgent: Wasting money on unnecessary roads)  US citizens: call on the Department of Transportation to recognize that Americans drive a little less every year, and stop wasting money on unnecessary roads.  27 August 2014 (Detroit resumes water shutoffs)  Detroit has resumed disconnecting poor people from water supply.  Some people have restored their own connections. Bravo!  27 August 2014 (Oil companies endanger New Orleans)  Greg Palast: oil companies destroyed the swamp that protected New Orleans from hurricanes, and an oil company shut down the research center that tried to warn people of the danger.  27 August 2014 (IPCC report on global heating)  The IPCC reports that global heating is already a source of danger and it may be impossible to reverse.  27 August 2014 (Imprisonment for attempting abortion)  A woman in Indiana faces many years' imprisonment for taking drugs to cause an abortion.  27 August 2014 (Thyroid cancer in Fukushima youth)  Young people who were in Fukushima at the time of the meltdown show a high rate of thyroid cancer.  27 August 2014 (Bus deregulation in the UK)  Bus deregulation in the UK (outside London) resulted in high fares and bad service.  This suggests to me that buses need a subsidy, and that deregulation meant elimination of the subsidy. Does anyone know?  27 August 2014 (How the Brutalized Become Brutal)  How the Brutalized Become Brutal.  27 August 2014 (Portable phone tracking)  Countries and criminals around the world are tracking people's movements through portable phones.  This is why I don't have one.  The NSA can figure out that two people know each other by seeing that their cell phones are in close proximity.  27 August 2014 (Pipeline protesters in Michigan)  Pipeline protesters in Michigan locked themselves to trucks to block construction of an oil pipeline.  27 August 2014 (Thug attacks man in wheelchair)  A Florida thug dumped a mostly paralyzed man onto the floor by tipping his wheelchair.  This incident is unusual, both for callousness, and because the thug's superior condemned it and apologized. It is not a basis for judging thugs in general.  But I think it is the extreme manifestation of an attitude that many thugs have in a less egregious form.  27 August 2014 (AT&amp;T's campaign against net neutrality)  How AT&amp;T buys the support of grass-roots organizations for its campaign against net neutrality.  27 August 2014 (Funds raised by Wisconsin governor)  Wisconsin Governor Walker actively raised funds for supposedly independent groups that were going to use the funds to promote voting for him.  27 August 2014 (Russian soldiers in Ukraine)  Russia admitted its soldiers were in Ukraine, and reporters trying to investigate reported secret graves in Russia of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine were attacked.  27 August 2014 (Hypersonic weapons)  Hypersonic weapons now being developed by the US, China and Russia would put the world on a hair trigger and could even be mistaken for a nuclear attack.  It would be smarter to sign a treaty to ban them, but the US government generally refuses, assuming it will have the advantage.  27 August 2014 (Urgent: Phone Lisa Kershner)  Everyone: phone Lisa Kershner, General Area Manager of Oakland Marriott City Center and Oakland Convention Center, at 1-510-466-6410, and say you object to their support for the "Urban Shield" event which promotes military weapons for use on US streets and in US homes.  27 August 2014 (Spanish women protest mayor)  Spanish women are protesting a mayor who warned men that women would make false accusations of rape.  The mayor's statement combines two points which don't really fit together. The suggestion to be careful where you go at 06:00 is wise, not just for women, and not just in regard to rape. There are places in Cambridge where I hesitate to walk when it is dark or deserted, because I don't want to be robbed.  To give this advice for avoiding rape does not excuse rape, any more than giving this advice for avoiding robbery excuses robbery. Safety advice does not inherently involve blaming the victim.  But sometimes it does. In the case of that mayor, for instance. When the mayor combines safety advice with claims about unlikely false accusations of rape, it is clear that he intends to attack women and is looking for pretexts.  27 August 2014 (Participation in Israel war crimes)  Palestine calls on various countries to investigate the participation of their citizens (who are soldiers in the Israeli army) in Israel war crimes.  27 August 2014 (Dalit women face threats of attack)  Dalit women who refuse to collect toilet waste face threats of attack from higher-caste people who demand this service.  27 August 2014 (Regulation of e-cigarettes)  WHO calls for regulation of e-cigarettes.  26 August 2014 (Russian soldiers in Ukraine)  Ukraine says its army has captured Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine alongside rebels.  26 August 2014 (Israel's destruction of buildings)  Israel's total destruction of tall buildings in Gaza is an intentional collective punishment of civilians. This is proved by the fact that Israel can, and in the past did, attack particular apartments without destroying the whole building.  26 August 2014 (If Argentina surrenders)  If Argentina surrenders to the vultures, it may be forced to surrender a lot of land to foreign powers.  26 August 2014 (UK gov't fabrications)  The UK government is fabricating absurd excuses to evade responsibility for undercover thug infiltrators that formed sexual relationships with activists, much as it is fabricating absurd excuses to evade responsibility for aiding US torture.  I may shock some people by saying this, but I think that sending thugs to infiltrate nonviolent opposition movements, in the absence of a serious crime (other than the crime of protesting), is totally unacceptable for a free society even if the thugs do not have sex with them.  26 August 2014 (Current instantiation of lynching)  Thugs' shooting black people is the current instantiation of lynching.  26 August 2014 (Guilty unless proven innocent)  A prominent Tory wants to apply "guilty unless proven innocent" to anyone that goes to Syria or Iraq.  26 August 2014 (NSA database of who talks to whom)  The NSA maintains a huge database of who talks with whom, including Americans as well as foreigners, and makes it available to several government agencies for all sorts of investigations.  26 August 2014 (Khalida Jarrar exiled)  Khalida Jarrar, a Palestinian human rights defender and feminist and member of the Palestinian parliament, has been arbitrarily exiled by Israel's army from Ramallah to a distant part of the West Bank.  26 August 2014 (ISIS massacres Shi'ite prisoners)  ISIS massacred Shi'ite prisoners in Mosul after telling them they were about to be released. This lie reminds me of the lies Nazis told to Jews to get them to cooperate with being killed.  I suspect the purpose of this massacre was to provoke Shi'ite militias to massacre Sunnis and thus force Sunnis to support ISIS.  26 August 2014 (Euro-austerity)  Germany may be forced to allow euro-austerity to stop.  26 August 2014 (Diablo Canyon nuclear reactors)  A former Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspector says that the NRC is ignoring its safety guidelines regarding the safety of the Diablo Canyon reactor in case of earthquake.  26 August 2014 (Shutdown of unofficial poll in Macao)  In Macao, an unofficial poll of citizens satisfaction with the chief official was shut down forcibly, based on an absurd pretext as usual.  26 August 2014 (How harsh reactions can backfire)  Strong and harsh reactions to the spreading of Islamist ideology can backfire (not to mention that they can violate human rights).  26 August 2014 (Heating of Earth's surface)  Short-term events and cycles explain the short-term discrepancy in heating of the Earth's surface since 2000, showing that the climate models were correct overall for the long term.  26 August 2014 (Cameron wants another "war on terror")  Cameron wants to grab at the ISIS provocation to start another open-ended "war on terror".  As the article says, this is strategically foolish; but it's a great excuse to smash what remains of civil liberties with "anti-terrorist" laws which can then be turned against dissidents, journalists, and journalists' spouses.  26 August 2014 (Faculty offer cancelled due to tweets)  The University of Illinois confirmed that it cancelled its faculty offer to Steven Salaita because he had criticized on Twitter the Israeli occupation pf Palestine.  I asked someone to find me a sample of his tweets; these are what I received.  I try my best to remember that we don't just stumble into political consciousness; it's better to teach than to berate or shame.  "Hamas" is the biggest red herring in American political discourse since Saddam's "weapons of mass destruction."  When will the attack on #Gazaend? What is left for #Israelto prove? Who is left for Israel to kill? This is the logic of genocide.  Members of the Knesset routinely call for the elimination of Palestinians, so #Israel can spare us the bullshit about restraint in #Gaza.  #Israelgets billions in aid, arms, and financial subsidies from the US, yet most Americans condemn imaginary Black women for welfare.  Rednecks need a new slogan. Instead of "kick their ass and take their gas," how about "#Gazais a disaster, but Netanyahu is my master"?  Republicans are such tough guys, eager to kill 4 God and country. #Israel slaps around the US of A, though, and all they do is ask for more.  The dude who wrote the genocide is permissible article has an egg avatar. Total hasbara troll.  I just got an email condemning my "slander of holy Israel." I reckon I can accept "slander," but "holy" seems a bit out of place.  I don't see anything here that legitimately justifies taking away a teacher's job.  26 August 2014 (UK's sham democracy)  As Scotland votes about independence, one Englishman is envious, wishing England had the chance to escape from its sham democracy.  What this says to me is that independence for Scotland is a side issue. All of the UK needs to real democracy.  26 August 2014 (Entrenched systematic bigotry)  Entrenched systematic bigotry means that fatal accidents systematically happen to the group on the receiving end.  26 August 2014 (Plastic fibers in harbors)  Harbors around the world have plastic fibers in the water, which can harm fish.  It will take a lot of work to find out how these fibers affect various species of fish.  26 August 2014 (Rush to approve killing a US citizen)  David Barron, now Federal Judge Barron, was in an awful rush to approve killing a US citizen with no criminal charges based on nothing but intelligence reports.  We know how a president can shape intelligence reports around whatever result he seeks, so this is little limitation.  26 August 2014 (Employees' social media profiles)  35% of young Britons would be happy to show their social media profiles to employers if pressured to do so.  The report says "in exchange for job security", which sounds like a benefit; but since employers can reduce job security to zero if they wish, in practice it means, "If you don't show us, you'll be fired (or never hired)."  It should be illegal for employers to even ask.  26 August 2014 (Outcomes of trials in Florida)  The outcome of trials in Florida is affected by the race of the people in the jury pool, in a strange way.  If all the jury pool is white, black defendants are more likely to get convicted than white defendants. But if at least one black person shows up for the jury pool, the disparity disappears &mdash; even a jury is made up only of whites.  I think it would be legitimate to arrange for partial racial balance in jury pools if that eliminates demonstrated unfairness in trial outcomes.  26 August 2014 (Roundup-ready GMO corn study)  The study that found damage in animals that were exposed to Roundup, or that ate Roundup-ready GMO corn, has been published again.  The journal that published it first later retracted it in suspicious circumstances.  26 August 2014 (Racism)  Thugs killed another black man in St Louis, not far from Ferguson. Video shows that there was no reason to shoot him, let alone shoot him 12 times rapidly without waiting as much as 15 seconds.  It could well be that those thugs really believed he was threatening them. Part of the effect of racism is that it leads people to perceive a black male as potentially violent. If the thugs are allowed to cite this as an excuse for killing someone, their murder spree will go unchecked.  Racist thinking is associated with the bad logic of "essentialist" thinking, but specific kinds of experiences can lead people out of such thinking.  25 August 2014 (Racist assaults teach justified rage)  Racist assaults, often by thugs, are frequent occurrences for blacks in the US, which teach them a justified rage.  Learning to control so much justified rage is not easy. It would help if they could get justice.  25 August 2014 (Shi'ite militias intend to expel Sunnis)  The Shi'ite militias that resist ISIS, where the Iraqi army is incompetent to do so, hate Sunnis and intend to expel them from any areas they capture from ISIS.  This is likely to force Sunnis to support ISIS even if they detest ISIS's oppression and cruelty. Unless they have somewhere else to turn, and at present they don't.  US Republicans want the US to intervene against ISIS in Syria.  I don't think the killing of one US journalist, on top of so many others murdered by ISIS, is particularly important. I don't think ISIS is close to attacking the US itself. Whether this sort of intervention is right depends mainly on its effects on the region itself. I can see the reasons in favor, but I also worry that things can go wrong in ways we are not likely to anticipate.  US military support for Kurdistan makes sense because Kurdistan is a nation fighting a conventional war. It has an army that is loyal to something more than its pay. In addition, Kurdistan is not likely to fall into brutality comparable to that of ISIS or the Shi'ite militias.  The use of drones to attack ISIS poses no special ethical issue because the targets are military units, typically equipped with unmistakable military vehicles or heavy weapons &mdash; not cars, houses and groups of people standing around, that might well have civilians in them.  Can/will Kurdistan protect Sunni Arabs that wish to join it? Can it offer them a way out of support for ISIS?  25 August 2014 (B'liar's business advised dictator of Kazakhstan)  Tony B'liar's business accepted a lot of money to advise the dictator of Kazakhstan on how to damp down the bad publicity he got from shooting a bunch of protesters and crushing the opposition.  25 August 2014 (A proprietary World Wide Web)  Google seems to be aiming slowly to make the World Wide Web effectively its proprietary product.  25 August 2014 (Liberal Zionism among Jews)  Israel's shift to right-wing racism means that Liberal Zionism among Jews elsewhere has hit a dead end.  Liberal Zionism means support for a Liberal Israel which no longer exists; Israelis who would support it are met with intimidation, even repression. No wonder 40% of Israelis are thinking of emigrating.  25 August 2014 (UK cuts in support for local government)  UK cuts in support for local government are focused on the poorest areas.  25 August 2014 (When thugs get fired)  When thugs do something violent, and get fired, they frequently move on to some other town that doesn't care.  25 August 2014 (Sugar in foods you would not expect)  Campaigning against the practice of putting sugar in lots of foods where you would not expect it.  25 August 2014 (Thug shot at Michael Brown as he was running away)  The Ferguson thugs confirm that a thug shot at Michael Brown as he was running away.  Apparently that shot did not hit Brown, but that miss is no excuse for shooting at someone who was no threat.  After they shot Brown, the thugs did not allow a nurse to perform CPR.  That amounts to deliberate murder.  25 August 2014 (Voter registration booths in Ferguson)  The head of the Missouri Republican Party thinks it is shameful that voter registration booths have been set up in Ferguson.  Republicans can't count on voter-suppression laws to prevent black citizens from voting; some of them will succeed in voting if they try.  25 August 2014 (India has permitted the entry of GMOs)  The government of India has permitted the entry of GMOs, disregarding its own laws over and over.  25 August 2014 (Opposition to ISIS)  Various states and parties in the Muslim world are declaring their opposition to ISIS.  25 August 2014 (Chinese film festival shut down)  Beijing Independent Film Festival Shut Down by Chinese Authorities.  25 August 2014 (Austerity in Europe)  Austerity Has Made Europe's Depression Longer Than In The 1930s.  25 August 2014 (Economic growth with less energy use)  Economic growth used to require more energy use, but now it is possible to invest in energy efficiency leading to growth with less energy use. Many governments don't do that, because they have surrendered to the fossil fuel companies, which won't permit it.  However, economic growth is not invariably a good thing. It is good when people generally share in it and it reduces inequality.  25 August 2014 (No expectation of justice for Brown)  The black citizens of Ferguson do not expect justice for Michael Brown.  25 August 2014 (Israel destroys two large buildings)  Israel completely destroyed two large buildings in Gaza, saying that Hamas was using space in them.  One of them had 44 apartments. Hamas should not have used one of them for warlike activities &mdash; if indeed it did so; I would not take Israel's word for that. But if Hamas did so, that doesn't excuse destroying the building.  25 August 2014 (Tripoli under Islamist control)  Islamists took control of Tripoli, bringing about the semipermanent fracture of Libya.  25 August 2014 (Racist repression)  From Gaza to Ferguson: Exposing the Toolbox of Racist Repression.  The US has seen cycles of racial segregation and desegregation in different areas. Segregated areas for blacks tend to be ruled by whites, with thugs that repress the black inhabitants on various pretexts.  Ferguson became poor, where people can barely get by from week to week and people can't afford education, as a result of companies' moving manufacturing out of the US.  Being poor, they are continually harassed by the US legal system, which in 2013 delivered three warrants per household in the town.  25 August 2014 (GE eucalyptus trees)  Genetically engineered eucalyptus trees won't directly hurt people, but they have the potential to do great ecological harm and encourage land grabs.  25 August 2014 ("Suspension" of the First Amendment)  The ACLU says that the First Amendment was "suspended" in Ferguson; the right to protest, or report on protest, was loaded with impossible requirements.  It points out that journalism in the US is under general attack.  25 August 2014 (Unpleasantness of Comcast)  The reason it is so unpleasant to deal with Comcast is that call center staff are under pressure to sell something, regardless of the purpose of the call.  25 August 2014 (Obama regime argues Nuremberg irrelevant)  The Obama regime argues in court that the Nuremberg trials are legally irrelevant to the culpability of Bush and his officials for the crime of aggressive war.  It is easy for US law to define US officials as legally immune from prosecution for whatever crime it may be. The moral argument is harder for them to win.  25 August 2014 (US university imposes censorship)  A lousy US university has imposed censorship on network access for students and others on campus.  25 August 2014 (Melting of ice sheets)  Satellite observations show that the melting of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has doubled since 2009.  Don't buy land within a few meters of sea level!  25 August 2014 (US thugs want more military weapons)  US thugs are campaigning to continue receiving military weapons and gear.  25 August 2014 (Ferguson thug "relieved of duty")  A thug from the vicinity of Ferguson was "relieved of duty" after it was seen that he had made a bigoted right-wing speech in an organization primarily of thugs and soldiers.  The thug has not been fired.  25 August 2014 (Abbott to push global heating)  Despite Abbott's mystification, his policies clearly reflect the intention to push global heating to the max.  25 August 2014 (Ferguson's Black community)  Ferguson's Black Community Must Not Be Given the Same 'Justice' As Trayvon Martin.  24 August 2014 (Right-Wing operative trying to do a hatchet job)  The Center for Media and Democracy, which often reports on ALEC's lobbying, believes that a right-wing operative is trying to do a hatchet job. He's the one who destroyed ACORN by publishing a misleading video.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: A fair and predictable work week)  Everyone: tell Starbucks to offer employees a fair and predictable work week.  24 August 2014 (The Lac M&eacute;gantic oil train explosion)  The Lac M&eacute;gantic oil train explosion was a disaster waiting to happen, due to weak safety rules granted to railroad magnates by an evidently corrupted government.  24 August 2014 (The kidnaping and killing of three Israeli teenagers)  A Hamas representative living in Turkey said that Hamas was responsible for kidnaping and killing three Israeli teenagers.  However, there are doubts about whether the Hamas leadership really ordered the kidnaping is not clear.  24 August 2014 (Australia's proposal for increased surveillance)  Australia's proposal for increased surveillance is written so broadly that the spy agency would be allowed to access any computer on the internet.  The government says wiping out privacy is supposed to be legitimate because "we're protecting you". The usual stupid excuse of tyrants.  24 August 2014 (US compensation for civilians killed in Yemen)  The US may be funding compensation for civilians killed in Yemen while refusing to admit killing them.  24 August 2014 (What Britain would have if it had avoided Tony B'liar)  What Britain would have if it had avoided Tony B'liar.  24 August 2014 (Ferguson relates to net neutrality)  Ferguson relates to net neutrality, which enables people to spread the word about what the thugs are doing.  It also relates to censorship by Facebook and now Twitter too.  24 August 2014 (Ocean cycles coincided in sinking Earth's acquired heat)  Two different ocean cycles coincided in sinking Earth's acquired heat for the past decade, so that the atmosphere didn't warm all that much.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: List the northern long-eared bat as endangered)  US citizens: call on the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the northern long-eared bat as an endangered species.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: Support regulation of pollution from oil refineries)  US citizens: Americans, comment to the EPA to support regulation of pollution from oil refineries.  24 August 2014 (UK must nationalize the trains)  The UK must nationalize the trains; privatizing them was wrong.  Privatization of a government service is generally harmful unless it allows the public to buy from a free competitive market. Otherwise, the private owners increase their profits by shafting the public, the workers, or both.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: End Google's support for ALEC)  Everyone: tell Google to stop supporting ALEC.  ALEC lobbies for damaging laws in US states and cities, but you don't need to be a US citizen to put pressure on Google.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: No heavy weapons for thugs)  US citizens: Sign this petition to stop providing heavy weapons to thugs.  24 August 2014 (Why Israel wants to keep fighting in Gaza)  Uri Avnery on why Israel wants to keep fighting in Gaza.  Avnery suspects that the three rockets supposedly launched from Gaza weren't really launched from Gaza.  24 August 2014 (Fanatics attack mosque in Iraq)  Shi'ite fanatics attacked a Sunni mosque in Iraq, killing almost 100 people.  Aside from being an atrocity, this will help ISIS gain support and commit atrocities.  24 August 2014 (Hollywood treatment of abortions)  Why Hollywood treats abortions as shocking and shameful &mdash; in contrast to the 1980s, when it treated them as no big deal.  24 August 2014 (US fighting in Iraq)  The US is not giving much information about its fighting in Iraq.  Drone weapons turn out to be convenient for suppressing journalism. In Dubya's invasion of Iraq, the Bush forces pressured nearly all journalists to "embed", which both limited their movements and pressured them to bias their coverage. But there's not even room for an embedded reporter in a drone.  24 August 2014 (Privatization in Britain)  Privatization in Britain has followed the path of privatization in Russia, leading to an immense transfer of wealth to the new owners.  24 August 2014 (Russian "humanitarian aid")  Most of the Russian "humanitarian aid" trucks entered Ukraine without inspection.  Putin would never go to such trouble for humanitarian purposes. This must have some harmful motive.  24 August 2014 (Racists cheer killing of blacks)  US right-wing racists are raising funds to support the thug that killed Michael Brown, cheering on the killing of more blacks.  24 August 2014 (Student reenactment of killings)  A teacher in the US was punished for allowing students to reenact two controversial killings, which the students themselves selected as important current events.  I don't see why students should not learn about these events in that way.  24 August 2014 (Mortar fired into town kills child)  A Palestinian mortar rocket killed an Israeli child.  Firing mortars at towns is a war crime, just like the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.  24 August 2014 (Pranksters threatened with prison)  Pranksters accused of painting the side of a building in Moscow are threatened with 7 years in prison.  They say they did not do the painting, but the more important point is that whoever did the painting should not be imprisoned.  23 August 2014 (School-to-prison pipeline)  The school-to-prison pipeline at work: a student in South Carolina was suspended from school, then arrested, for writing a story about shooting a pet dinosaur.  The thugs say he was arrested for his reaction when the thugs threatened him. Of course, being threatened by armed thugs who can put you in prison by lying about you is enough to rattle most anyone. It takes training and experience to avoid giving them something they can twist into an excuse to put you in the wrong.  23 August 2014 (India censors film)  India has censored a film about the assassination of Indira Gandhi because of the political slant of certain scenes.  This shows where the UK will get to if it continues down the path of political censorship.  A censorship board that does its job "honestly" is a bigger threat to human rights than one that can be bribed not to censor.  23 August 2014 (The Security Council and Syria)  The UN human rights chief says the Security Council's ineffectiveness on Syria caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.  However, there is was no proper action the Security Council could have taken in regard to Syria, even if it had not been paralyzed between the US and Russia.  The US and UK are now being drawn by necessity into allying with Assad in Syria against ISIS.  The only chance for supporting opposition to Assad with good results was when the opposition was not jihadi. I think Saudi Arabia and Qatar are to blame for the jihadists in Syria.  23 August 2014 (Public school spending cuts)  The public school reality that white Americans won't see: cuts in spending, especially on schools in poor neighborhoods, track the children (mostly minority groups) into bad lives (or prison).  The various "education reform" programs that the US has seen since 2000 in effect pretend to compensate for these cuts with burdensome handwaving. The result is that poor American children have been forced into what we might call "reform school".  24 August 2014 (Urgent: Reject the Comcast-TWC merger)  US citizens: call on the FCC to reject the Comcast-TWC merger.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: Reject palm oil made from deforestation)  Everyone: call on McDonalds to pledge to reject palm oil made from deforestation.  I have never eaten at McDonalds, because I don't need to repeat someone else's mistake in order to learn from it. McDonalds makes fast food &mdash; food for not eating.  24 August 2014 (UK gov't planning giveaway of public land)  The UK government is planning a massive giveaway of public land, a requirement to extract all fossil fuels, and abolition of local planning.  24 August 2014 (Thailand made military coup permanent)  Thailand has made its military coup effectively permanent by declaring the head general to be "prime minister".  24 August 2014 (Urgent: Don't import apples from China)  US citizens: tell the USDA, don't import apples from China.  24 August 2014 (Hamas supports Palestine's joining the ICC)  Hamas supports Palestine's joining the International Criminal Court. This would expose Hamas and its agents to war crimes prosecutions, as well as Israel and its agents.  24 August 2014 (UK immigration prisons paying prisoners a pittance)  UK immigration prisons are paying prisoners a pittance to cook and clean. Ironically, those prisoners are not allowed to work in the UK outside prison.  This practice hurts not only the prisoners but all workers in the UK. Whoever does this work should be paid a decent wage.  24 August 2014 (Green Party condemns injustices in policing)  The Green Party condemns many systematic injustices in the policing of the US.  24 August 2014 (Corporations Spy on Nonprofits)  Corporations Spy on Nonprofits (that criticize them) with Impunity (in the US).  24 August 2014 (Protesters Hold Up Mirrors to Police)  Oakland Protesters Hold Up Mirrors to Police Officers in Ferguson Solidarity March.  Thousands rallied in New York City.  24 August 2014 (Bank of America agreed to pay a fine for mortgage fraud)  Bank of America agreed to pay a fine for mortgage fraud, but it's much smaller than it appears to be.  24 August 2014 (Consult Congress before military interventions)  Congress should insist that Obama consult Congress before military interventions such as the bombing campaign in Iraq.  24 August 2014 (Insurance coverage of contraception)  Obama has taken steps to protect insurance coverage of contraception from the Hobby Lobby decision.  24 August 2014 (Urgent: Oppose Comcast-Time Warner merger)  US citizens: submit a comment to the FCC opposing the merger between Comcast and Time Warner.  That two companies with such large share of any market should not be allowed to merge ought to be a no-brainer. Unfortunately, the US goverment has been turned into a zombie by businesses, and has trouble with no-brainers.  23 August 2014 (Urgent: Stop supporting Urban Shield)  Everyone: call on Marriott to stop supporting Urban Shield, the main US event to promote militarization of thugs.  23 August 2014 (Urgent: Prosecutor for killing of Brown)  Everyone: call on DA McCulloch to appoint a special prosecutor for the killing of Michael Brown.  23 August 2014 (Sweden sentences artist to prison)  Sweden sentenced an artist to prison for "racist" art.  I share their disapproval of racism, but censorship threatens everyone.  23 August 2014 (World Bank redefining poverty)  The World Bank and friends say that they are eliminating poverty, but it's more like redefining poverty.  23 August 2014 (Canada's attempt to gag professor)  Canadian professor John Smol rebuked the government for trying to gag him from talking about his measurements of pollution from oil sand strip mining.  23 August 2014 (US "war on terror")  The US "war on terror" has not only failed, it has backfired.  23 August 2014 (US "economic recovery" lopsided)  The US "economic recovery" is lopsided, leaving low-paid workers poorer than before.  23 August 2014 (Earnings for Britons under 30)  Earnings for Britons under 30 have fallen around 10% in 4 years.  23 August 2014 (UK censorship in politics)  UK censorship expands to politics with a vengeance; the government threatens anyone redistributing or even watching an ISIS propaganda video.  Censorship "invariably starts with the suppression of viewpoints which are so widely hated that the emotional response they produce drowns out any consideration of the principle being endorsed."  23 August 2014 (Withdrawl of National Guard from Ferguson)  The National Guard is being withdrawn from Ferguson.  I hope that the protests do not peter out soon. Nothing fundamental has been corrected.  23 August 2014 (Trial of Sharif Mobley blocked)  The trial of Sharif Mobley is blocked because the Yemeni government is holding him in a secret prison and won't allow him to see the court or his lawyers.  22 August 2014 (Protests in NYC, LA, Oakland)  Protests have occurred in NYC, Los Angeles, Oakland and elsewhere against the killing of local people by thugs and in solidarity with Ferguson.  22 August 2014 (Russian humanitarian aid convoy)  The Russian humanitarian aid convoy is starting to enter Ukraine after Red Cross inspection.  Putin could have got all these trucks inspected by the Red Cross days before, and into Ukraine without conflict, if he had wanted to.  22 August 2014 (Venezuela to use biometric card)  Venezuela plans to use a biometric card to ration subsidized products so they won't be smuggled into Colombia and resold.  Switching to a system like food stamps would solve this problem pretty well.  22 August 2014 (Cameras on meter maids)  It's right to make thugs wear cameras in public, but why do that to meter maids?  22 August 2014 (Twitter censors video)  Twitter undermines its history of respect for freedom of speech by censoring a bloody ISIS propaganda video.  Operators of Diaspora hosts are reportedly threatened with punishment if people post the ISIS propaganda on their hosts.  I think this is censorship as dangerous as ISIS. Your opinions are next on the list.  22 August 2014 (Airport X-ray scanners)  Tests prove that many kinds of weapons and explosives can be smuggled through the X-ray scanners that were formerly used, untested, for "security" in airports.  Even worse, if one of these machines were to break, it could give a person a dangerous radiation burn. Once I learned that, I opted out every time. I said, "Please feel me up."  22 August 2014 (Israeli weapons factory in UK shut down)  Protesters explain why they shut down an Israeli weapons factory in the UK.  The crime of "aggravated trespass" is a synonym for "annoying protest". To accuse anyone of that crime is a sign of an antidemocratic government.  22 August 2014 (Neighborhood in Liberia quarantined)  A neighborhood in Liberia has been quarantined to block spread of Ebola.  I don't know whether this sort of measure is effective enough to justify the loss of liberty it involves.  22 August 2014 (Repression of Australia's homeless)  Repression of the homeless in Australia: in Melbourne, begging is a crime.  As the Australian government proposes to cut the support for the unemployed, especially those under 30, it will make more homeless people that will be forced into "crime".  22 August 2014 (Aborting Down's syndrome fetuses)  Richard Dawkins says that women have a moral duty to abort a fetus that has Down's syndrome.  I completely concur. Having a baby with Down's syndrome does harm to someone (that baby). An abortion does no harm to anyone.  22 August 2014 (US military prohibits reading The Intercept)  The US military says that employees will be punished if they read The Intercept.  This prohibition would be ludicrous if it were not so dangerous. It covers millions of people, soldiers and civilians, many of whom will obey the prohibition. Then they will base their thoughts on, and spread, a warped world view which they have taken for truth.  22 August 2014 (Ferguson protests)  Ferguson protests respond to systematic repression and disenfranchisement.  22 August 2014 (Ferguson thugs raid church)  Thugs in Ferguson raided a church that was providing medical care to protesters who were suffering from tear gas.  22 August 2014 (Another proposed oil pipeline)  Mobilizing Canadians against the Atlantic substitute for the Keystone XL pipeline.  22 August 2014 (Urgent: Help End Domestic Slavery)  US citizens: Help End Domestic Slavery.  With Javascript disabled, this page does work even though it appears to have failed.  22 August 2014 (Investigators barred from Gaza)  Israel is blocking the staff of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch from going to Gaza to investigate war crimes.  22 August 2014 (Rising sea level)  A town in the Solomon Islands has to move to higher ground as sea level rises.  The US must start planning to move parts of Boston, parts of New York City, parts of Washington DC, and all of Florida. This move won't be needed for some decades, but it will take decades to do.  22 August 2014 (Hidden costs of fracking)  The hidden costs of fracking are tremendous.  22 August 2014 (Arrested for filming NY thugs)  New York gubernatorial candidate Randy Credico was arrested and given a little gratuitous torture in New York City for making a video of thugs' arresting someone else.  I hope he wins and starts jailing thugs for such conduct.  22 August 2014 (Activist, age 90, arrested in Ferguson)  Activist Hedy Epstein, age 90, was arrested for protesting in Ferguson.  Her supposed "crime" was simply continuing to protest.  Thugs in Ferguson repeatedly offered to "help" some reporters by taking them far away from the protests, "for their safety".  Considering that the only danger to them is from the thugs, this is really half of a threat.  22 August 2014 (New Australian coal mine)  A new Australian coal mine was allowed to dicker down the compensation it would have to pay for predicted damage to the Great Barrier Reef.  For several reasons, this mine should not be allowed at all.  22 August 2014 (The Real Looting of Ferguson)  The Real Looting of Ferguson: Its Black Citizens Never Had a Chance to Get By.  22 August 2014 (Secrets exposed by James Risen)  Here are the embarrassing secrets for which Obama plans to imprison James Risen.  22 August 2014 (Civilian casualties in Gaza)  A former Israeli gun crew chief says he does not believe Israel's claim to have tried to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.  22 August 2014 (Corporations expect tax amnesty)  US corporations claim that corporation taxes are too high, but really they believe that since they got one tax amnesty they are entitled to tax amnesties ad infinitem.  22 August 2014 (Reading on the Amazon Swindle)  A study found that people who read novels on the Amazon Swindle remember less of the events.  I think issues like this are less important than the injustice of the Swindle.  22 August 2014 (New military weapons for thugs)  They claim that military weapons and equipment for thugs are "surplus", but 1/3 of them are new.  I think there are multiple motives for it. Repressing racial minorities and the poor is one reason. Feeding the manufacturers is another.  21 August 2014 (Urgent: Stop choosing McCain as a pundit)  In the US, or where US TV networks are available: Call on TV networks to stop choosing McCain as a pundit.  21 August 2014 (Override state laws purchased by ISPs)  US cities, and senators, are asking the FCC to override state laws purchased by ISPs that ban municipal broadband networks.  21 August 2014 (Saudi Arabia's role in creating ISIS)  Saudi Arabia's role in creating ISIS, the monster that it can no longer control.  21 August 2014 (Someone in Gaza fired rockets at Israel)  Someone in Gaza fired rockets at Israel, breaking the cease fire. Israel responded by killing the family of a Hamas leader, and another family.  21 August 2014 (US thugs keep on killing unarmed black men)  US thugs keep on killing unarmed black men, then fabricating excuses.  Here's What Happens to Police Officers Who Shoot Unarmed Black Men.  White Supremacy Is the Real Culprit in Ferguson. The Excuses Just Prove It.  21 August 2014 (Undo militarization of US thugs)  Dennis Kucinich explains what is needed to undo militarization of US thugs.  21 August 2014 (Israel kills Gazans all the time)  Israel kills Gazans all the time, not just when there is a war.  21 August 2014 (Israel campaigning to undermine international humanitarian law)  Israel is systematically campaigning to undermine international humanitarian law &mdash; the treaties about war crimes which Israel has been condemned for violating.  21 August 2014 (Israeli soldiers arrested 64 Palestinian)  Israeli soldiers arrested 64 Palestinians from the West Bank, clearly for political reasons.  Israeli soldiers demolished a Palestinian home in Jerusalem without warning, and did not allow the inhabitants to take out any of their property.  21 August 2014 (Israeli sociologist tries to explain psychology of fear)  An Israeli sociologist tries to explain the psychology of fear that enables Israelis to see themselves as humane while dehumanizing Palestinians.  The article also offers explanations for how Israel became almost entirely hawkish, racist and right-wing.  If 40% of Israelis wish to emigrate, I suspect that it's because those who are more or less secular expect the religious fanatics to take over and oppress them.  21 August 2014 (ISIS advancing in Syria)  ISIS is advancing territory in Syria using weapons captured from the Iraqi army.  It seems the West must attack ISIS in Syria to protect Assad. Murderous as he is, letting ISIS defeat him would be even worse.  20 August 2014 (Urgent: Tighten rules on ivory)  US citizens: call for the US to tighten rules on ivory, to protect elephants.  20 August 2014 (Artist/Hackers who put white flags on Brooklyn Bridge)  Two artist/hackers who put white flags on the Brooklyn Bridge fear they will be permanently excluded from the US.  It sure looks like the US has no sense of humor.  20 August 2014 (Iraqi gov't failed in an attempt to retake Tikrit)  The Iraqi government failed in an attempt to retake Tikrit; Isis soldiers gave hard resistance.  US air strikes are easy and effective in open country, but not in cities.  If Tikrit is indeed controlled by Baathists and Sunni militants, as the article says, it should be possible to make a peace with them. They can't be very happy with Isis; they must regard it as a last resort to get out from under the Maliki's sectarian rule. The challenge will be to convince them that a new Iraqi government won't be equally bad.  20 August 2014 (Urgent: Protect Americans from oil trains)  US citizens: call on the DOT to protect Americans from oil trains.  20 August 2014 (Australia forcing Syrian refugees back to Syria)  Australia is going to "unthinkable" lengths to force Syrian refugees back to Syria, where they face torture or death.  20 August 2014 (Australian state proposes guilty-until-proven-innocent)  The Australian state of Victoria proposes US-style seizure of possessions on a system of guilty-until-proven-innocent.  20 August 2014 (ICANN considering giving gov'ts total power)  ICANN is considering giving governments almost total power over its decisions.  20 August 2014 (Journalist reports on his arrest in Ferguson)  A journalist reports on his arrest in Ferguson. Thugs shot him first. They did not really care why he was there; they were arresting anyone who could be found.  Note the sleazy excuse for denying the journalist the right to phone his lawyer. Just the sort of behavior I'd expect from a thug.  Then a press photographer was arrested, for not standing where the thugs wanted photographers to stand. These thugs think they are entitled to control protests and control the press.  I am glad that some of the protesters tried to control random violence by other protesters. That sort of indiscipline leads to defeat. While it is less serious, intrinsically, than the thugs' violence, it gives the thugs an excuse to pretend that they are protecting the town rather than occupying it.  Some suspect that the few violent protesters are outsiders.  The next night, they arrested 78 people, protesters and bystanders and journalists I suppose.  20 August 2014 (Countries that trample human rights given opportunity to retort)  Other countries that trample human rights more than the US find in Ferguson an opportunity to retort.  I wish the US would clean up its act so it could criticize oppression without making people laugh.  20 August 2014 (Arrests of Reporters in Ferguson)  The Committee to Protect Journalists Condemns Ongoing Harassment, Arrests of Reporters in Ferguson.  20 August 2014 (Guatemala's New DC Lobbyist)  The Man Who Ran Contra Propaganda for Reagan Is Guatemala's New DC Lobbyist.  20 August 2014 (Urgent: Union organizing bill)  US citizens: support the bill to make firing union organizers a matter of discrimination.  It's already forbidden, but this would make it easier and faster to enforce the ban.  20 August 2014 (Lobbying by UK environmental dept)  The UK's environmental department is lobbying the EU to keep a very dirty coal power plant running.  20 August 2014 (City councilor of Ferguson)  One of the thugs who accused Henry Davis of "destruction of property" for bleeding on their uniforms is now a city councilor in Ferguson.  20 August 2014 (Wealth of the 1%)  The wealth of the 1% is literally beyond measure, because they hide so much of it. What they sequester has prevented economic recovery for the rest.  20 August 2014 (UK's complicity in CIA torture)  The UK ambassador to the US has been lobbying the US Senate since 2012 to conceal the UK's complicity in CIA torture.  20 August 2014 (Gang of thugs)  A gang of thugs (not cops this time)  attacked an editor in Sudan that had advocated normalizing relations with Israel, and trashed the newspaper office.  20 August 2014 (Whipped for criticizing book)  Two Iranians will be whipped for criticizing a book published by a local official on artistic grounds.  20 August 2014 (Language of the unheard)  M. L. King: A riot is the language of the unheard.  20 August 2014 (Civilians in convoy hit by rockets)  Ukraine and rebels accuse each other of firing rockets at a convoy that was evacuating civilians.  I expect that neither side attacked them intentionally, but this is the sort of thing that happens in war, and even more so when care is not taken.  However, firing the inaccurate Grad rockets into urban areas is a war crime, and I have seen accusations that Ukraine regularly does that.  20 August 2014 (Ferguson thug violence facts)  Ten Facts About Police Violence in Ferguson Sunday Night.  20 August 2014 (Militarization of US thugs)  Arms companies have effectively paid Congress to support militarization of US thugs.  20 August 2014 (Failure to coexist)  The pollution and resource scarcity problems that humanity is creating can be seen as a failure in coexistence with the natural world.  20 August 2014 (New "counter-terrorism" proposals in Australia)  Civil liberties organizations in Australia warn that human rights are threatened by the new "counter-terrorism" proposals.  There is very little danger of terrorism in Australia. It's just an excuse to attack human rights.  20 August 2014 (Extreme capitalism)  Extreme capitalism is the idea that every aspect of society has to be run as a business. This is a major cause of what's wrong in US education and health care.  20 August 2014 (Urgent: Respect the rights of peaceful protesters)  US citizens: support Amnesty International's call for the Ferguson thug chief to respect the rights of peaceful protesters.  20 August 2014 (Republicans blocking funds for processing "rape kits")  Republicans are blocking federal funds for processing the backlog of "rape kits" containing evidence from complaints of rape.  Those right-wingers don't care much about any sort of rights if they are for women.  20 August 2014 (Undermining Constitution with illegal spying and dirty tricks)  Richard Nixon faced impeachment for undermining the Constitution with illegal spying and dirty tricks. Under Bushbama it's even worse.  20 August 2014 (Earth Overshoot Day)  Aug 19 is "Earth Overshoot Day", the day when we've used, since the beginning of the year, as much resources as the Earth can sustain for the whole year.  Just 14 years ago, that point was reached in October.  20 August 2014 (Irom Sharmila ordered for release)  Irom Sharmila has been in prison and on hunger strike for 14 years after witnessing a massacre by the Indian Army.  I think she was never given a trial, but a court now ordered her release.  20 August 2014 (You don't control your mobile phone)  Bringing home the fact that you don't control your mobile phone, there's an app to give someone else remote control over it.  20 August 2014 (Obama is stretching the facts)  Obama is stretching the facts to avoid asking Congress for authorization to use military force in Iraq.  Congress should not accept this stretching. What's at stake is the US Constitution.  20 August 2014 (Urgent: Defend the rights of the Tibetan people)  Everyone: call for your country to defend the rights of the Tibetan people under repression.  When 100 Tibetans protested, Chinese thugs shot several, then arrested them and denied them medical treatment. Some died from this.  20 August 2014 (We can switch entirely to renewable energy)  Amory Lovins claims we can switch entirely to renewable energy without on-grid storage by using time-shifting to make demand fit the momentary supply.  We need to be careful to set up these systems so that they don't collect information about what systems we are using.  For instance, if the goal is to tell 1/4 of the air conditioning systems in a substantial area to shut off, it isn't necessary to find out which ones happen to be on at the moment. Statistically, the result would be roughly the same if you make the decision based on which houses have such air conditioning.  19 August 2014 (On Hacking updates)  Update to On Hacking to recognize that "hacking" is not supposed to cover wit and art.  18 August 2014 (Cesarean section forced on woman)  A desperate woman in Ireland was forced to have a cesarean section, when she threatened to starve herself after being denied an abortion.  She was pregnant because of a rape committed before she reached Ireland.  Abortion is a basic right.  18 August 2014 (Iraqi Kurds recapture Mosul dam)  The Iraqi Kurds recaptured the Mosul dam, with US air support.  18 August 2014 (Michael Brown's autopsy report)  Michael Brown's autopsy report says he was shot 6 times, all from the front.  Even if the thug's actions after stopping Brown were not wrong, it seems clear he would not have stopped a white man.  US thugs will let you walk around with a weapon (in some states) &hellip; if you're white. If you're black, they order you to drop it, and shoot you before you have a chance to comply, even if it's a toy.  In other words, "open carry" laws potentiate the effect of racist attitudes.  18 August 2014 (Cost of filing worker complaint in UK)  Now that the UK charges workers almost $2000 for filing a discrimination case, complaints have gone down by 80%. Only well-paid workers can afford to complain.  18 August 2014 (EPA fails to make polluters pay)  The EPA has failed for 30 years to issue legally required rules to make polluters pay to clean up their pollution.  18 August 2014 (Coal ash and asthma)  Just living near a place where coal ash is handled or dumped can give people asthma.  18 August 2014 (US pressure against Gaza inquiry)  The US is pressuring the ICC and Mahmoud Abbas not to request an investigation into Israeli and Palestinian war crimes.  18 August 2014 (Australia's renewable energy target)  Australia's government said it would maintain the renewable energy target but is clearly making plans to create an excuse to eliminate it.  18 August 2014 (The background of ISIS)  Explaining the background of ISIS in radicalization of Sunnis.  18 August 2014 (10,000 Israelis protest for peace)  10,000 Israelis demonstrated for peace with Gaza.  It was a good try, but I think it will take more than 10,000 to influence the government, and the Arab-hating people.  18 August 2014 (Western media's superficial view)  Western news media have a superficial view of many countries, because reporters nowadays don't stay in a place long enough to know what's what.  18 August 2014 (Curfew in Ferguson)  The curfew in Ferguson was obeyed by recognized leaders and organizers, but hundreds of people stayed past midnight in pouring rain rather than let thugs chase them out of their town.  This article says the thugs did use tear gas.  18 August 2014 (SWAT raids in the US)  Over 100 SWAT raids occur each day in the US, and most of them are for nothing more serious than searching a house for drugs.  This is accompanied by training thugs to act like an occupying army. If they expect to shoot people down, they will find opportunities to do it.  Here is data about the military equipment that the US has given to thugs.  18 August 2014 (Facebook forcing app on users)  Facebook is ordering users to switch to a different Messenger app which demands access to lots of personal information.  It's proprietary software, thus inherently untrustworthy, so using it is an act of folly. The same is true of Facebook's main app, and the nonfree program (in either iThings or Android) for accessing the app store where it is released.  In Android, that program is called Google Play, and it has a back door that is more or less universal.  Of course, you shouldn't be used by Facebook at all, because it extracts personal data that nobody ought to know.  18 August 2014 (Mob drives out Ebola patients)  A mob attacked a clinic in Liberia and drove out 29 people infected with Ebola.  Now they are likely to infect other people. Way to go, idiots!  The patients have been found and brought to another clinic.  18 August 2014 (Abbott serving fossil fuel companies)  Australian PM Abbott's plan to stop promoting renewable energy would amount to a 10 billion dollar gift to the fossil fuel companies he serves. And without even achieving the promised insignificant side benefit of a reduction in electricity prices.  18 August 2014 (Racist response to wedding in Israel)  A Jewish Israeli woman converted to Islam and is marrying an Arab. This has brought out various sorts of racists.  I find it hard to imagine a greater folly than for a woman to convert to Islam. But she has a right to do it, and a right to get married.  18 August 2014 (Torture of suspects)  A US woman accused in Indonesia of murdering her mother says that thugs are beating her and threatening to deny her water unless she confesses.  I have no opinion about whether she is guilty of those charges. There may be valid reasons to prosecute her, but suspects should not be tortured.  17 August 2014 ("We don't talk with terrorists")  The slogan "We don't talk with terrorists" is often an excuse to continue war.  Negotiating ransom with terrorists is what one should never do. Negotiating peace, that's different.  17 August 2014 (Urgent: Protect farm workers from dangerous pesticides)  US citizens: call on the EPA to protect farm workers from dangerous pesticides.  17 August 2014 (Ferguson Won't Be The Last Flash Point)  On Race, America Has Far to Go. Ferguson Won't Be The Last Flash Point.  17 August 2014 (Union activists blocked an Israeli ship from docking in Oakland)  Union activists blocked an Israeli ship from docking in Oakland as a protest against the bombardment of Gaza.  Australian thugs are trying to arbitrarily ban a protest against an Israeli film festival in Australia.  17 August 2014 (Urgent: Stop militarizing US thugs)  US citizens: sign these two petitions to stop militarizing US thugs.  17 August 2014 (Require supermarkets to donate unsold but still edible food)  French MPs propose to require supermarkets to donate unsold but still edible food to charities.  In principle, the idea seems good.  17 August 2014 (Poisonous algae in Lake Erie)  Poisonous algae in Lake Erie seem to result from a change in the form of phosphorus used in fertilizer.  17 August 2014 (Afghan thugs raided a coffee shop)  Afghan thugs raided a coffee shop because women and men were allowed to sit and talk there.  17 August 2014 (Question Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy)  Ecuador's foreign minister asks why the Swedish government fails to use the opportunity to question Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy, and thus denies justice both to Assange and to the women who made a complaint against him.  Of course, we can infer the answer easily.  17 August 2014 (California "Kill Switch" Bill)  California "Kill Switch" Bill Could Be Used to Disrupt Protests.  17 August 2014 (Advocates of greater regional autonomy in Russia)  Advocates of greater regional autonomy in Russia have been arrested and their demonstrations banned.  I think it is proper for wealthier regions to support the development of poorer regions; thus, I disagree with demands for independence from the wealthier regions based on objection to this; for example, in Catalunya because its taxes help poorer parts of Spain.  If Siberia is proportionally richer than other parts of Russia, I would object likewise in Siberia's case. But I don't know whether that is so, and I don't know what Putin is doing with the tax money.  17 August 2014 (Greatest Enemy of Press Freedom in a Generation)  James Risen Calls Obama 'Greatest Enemy of Press Freedom in a Generation'.  17 August 2014 (Urgent: Thank Obama)  US citizens: thank Obama for rethinking weapons deliveries to Israel.  17 August 2014 (Urgent: Disincentivize tax avoidance)  US citizens: call on Obama to eliminate the tax incentives for companies to move their headquarters outside the US.  17 August 2014 (UK thugs want people's medical records)  UK thugs want to be allowed to look at people's confidential medical records without getting a warrant (let alone permission). They cite "vulnerable" people as an excuse, but the loss of rights would apply to everyone.  Perhaps it is, in a sense, about vulnerable people. When undercover thugs infiltrate a dissident group, if they could check the medical records of everyone in the group, they could quickly find which ones are vulnerable to being pressured into a sexual relationship.  17 August 2014 (US media spin on Gazan casualties)  How US media spin the civilian casualties in Gaza &mdash; including claiming that civilians working for Hamas in non-military roles count as combatants.  17 August 2014 (iThing users' data in China)  Apple is storing the data of iThing users in China on servers in China.  Since Apple can extract lots of personal data from an iThing remotely, I think Apple will have great difficulty refusing when China demands that it do so.  17 August 2014 (Human rights lawyer tortured in China)  China released human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng from prison, starved and with smashed teeth.  His teeth fell out because he was given limited food. He was tortured both physically and mentally. Now he can hardly speak.  17 August 2014 (Ferguson protests)  Al Sharpton exhorted Ferguson protesters to avoid weakening their case by engaging in crimes such as looting.  This is wise advice: blacks of the 60s won advances in civil rights through discipline, and protesters today need discipline too.  Since then, a curfew has been imposed. I don't expect the protesters to disperse quietly just because someone told them to.  17 August 2014 (Ukrainian rebel soldiers)  A Ukrainian rebel leader claims to have 1200 soldiers who were trained in Russia, as well as 30 tanks.  They could not have captured 30 tanks from the Ukrainian army in that area. If the claim is true, most of those tanks must have come from Russia. Perhaps Russia captured Ukrainian tanks in the Crimea and sent them to Ukraine.  17 August 2014 (Poverty in the US)  Communities, Individuals, and the Long Fight Against Poverty [in the US].  This fight would not be nearly so long if not for the rich that defend poverty for everyone else.  17 August 2014 (Hillary-The-Hawk Flies Again)  Hillary-The-Hawk Flies Again.  17 August 2014 (Urgent: Reverse Corporations United)  US citizens: Call for approval of the constitutional amendment to reverse the Corporations United decision (to call them what they are, not what they pretended to be).  17 August 2014 (The Rabaa massacre)  The Rabaa massacre, one year later.  17 August 2014 (Michael Brown accused of stealing cigars)  Michael Brown has been accused of stealing cigars from a store shortly before he was killed. The thugs have given conflicting stories about whether his killer knew about that.  The news of this ended the temporary peace between the thugs and the people of Ferguson, as the people took this as an attempt to smear the victim.  17 August 2014 (Ferguson's Days of Unrest)  Ferguson's Days of Unrest Expose Stark Reality of a Segregated Society.  One white resident says about black drivers who get stopped: "Tires gone, lights out, no insurance, pieces of junk, that's why."  Perhaps it is true that black residents of Ferguson tend to have cars that are nearly junk, and leave things unrepaired. I wonder why. Perhaps because they don't get enough work, or their unemployment benefits were cut off, or they get paid minimum wage which is worth less and less, or they were victims of fraudulent foreclosure. Or their relatives have these problems, and they have to help their relatives rather than get a nice new car.  17 August 2014 (Obama threatens freedom of the press in the US)  James Risen is epitome of how Obama (continuing Dubya's policy) threatens freedom of the press in the US.  17 August 2014 (Yazidis)  The main group of Yazidis, on Mt Sinjar, escaped the siege of genocidal ISIS, but smaller groups caught in villages are being massacred.  17 August 2014 (Fracking under the sea)  Fracking under the sea threatens coastal ecosystems.  17 August 2014 (Threatening to jail for "liking" a Facebook post)  Malaysia demonstrated contempt for human rights by threatening to jail a citizen for three years for "liking" a Facebook post that praises Israel.  Being a used of Facebook is foolish, but expressing opinions there should not be a crime.  17 August 2014 (Facebook's filtering algorithm suppressed news about thug riot)  Algorithmic filtering can affect history, not just hide history. Facebook's filtering algorithm suppressed news about the thug riot in Ferguson until after it became national news.  17 August 2014 (UK gov't blocked publication)  The UK government has blocked publication of the report into the cause of horsemeat in the "beef", because it will point the finger at the government's cuts in inspecting food.  The deeper cause, which the report may not mention, is the EU's deregulation that makes it easy to ship meat from one company to another, in different countries, in a long sequence. Make the supply chain long enough, and there is sure to be a cheater in it at some point.  The US wants to do both of these things: undermine inspections and deregulate meat imports.  Fraud is profitable, so when business determines the laws, it often legislates for fraud.  17 August 2014 (Ferguson thugs' previous caper)  Ferguson thugs' previous caper: they arrested the wrong man, jailed him even after they became aware of this, kicked him in the head, then charged him with the crime of damaging thug department property (bleeding on their uniforms).  Maybe he didn't bleed on their uniforms at all &mdash; the thugs later said they had made it up.  These thugs committed perjury. Why are they not in prison for that?  17 August 2014 (Eyeless in Gaza)  Uri Avnery: Eyeless in Gaza.  17 August 2014 (Big spill of mine waste in Canada)  A big spill of mine waste in Canada has led to repercussions against the mine.  16 August 2014 (Criminalizing journalism)  Australia's National Security Proposals Will Criminalise Journalists, Says Union.  16 August 2014 (Australia's plan for asylum seekers)  Australia plans to tell asylum seekers they should go to Cambodia instead.  It might be a valid response, except that Cambodia treats asylum seekers almost as badly as Australia does.  16 August 2014 (Israel's "Hannibal Directive")  The widely acknowledged (though not officially) "Hannibal Directive", by which the Israeli army risks killing its own soldiers to make sure they are not taken prisoner, means that the Israeli government will kill Israelis to avoid annoying negotiations.  When you get accustomed to dehumanizing the enemy, you tend to dehumanize your friends too by force of habit.  16 August 2014 (US frackers injecting diesel)  US frackers continue injecting diesel fuel even though it is illegal.  16 August 2014 (Gouging uninsured people)  A California Hospital Charged $10,000 for a Cholesterol Test.  This is an extreme case of a standard practice of gouging people who don't have an insurance company to push for a lower price.  16 August 2014 (Israel punishes peace advocacy)  The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, which monitors violations of Palestinians' human rights and called for peace in Gaza, has been singled out for punishment by the state because of its peace advocacy.  This fits into the general pattern in Israel of repression of those that oppose the occupation. Israel boasted of being the only free society in the Middle East, but it isn't much of a free society any more.  16 August 2014 (Militarization of US thugs)  Due to militarization of US thugs, Ferguson looks like Iraq.  For US blacks, being killed by thugs is not unusual, and being harassed by thugs is an everyday occurrence.  However, while racial profiling is unfair, that's not the central issue here. It's a fact that the people killed by thugs for no reason tend to belong to certain minority groups, but that's not what makes these killings wrong. The killing of Michael Brown would have been equally wrong if he were of some other ethnic group.  The unjustified violence of thugs, exacerbated by their militarization, is the central issue.  16 August 2014 (Australia to push more into poverty)  The Australian government hopes a meaningless apology will mollify those it intends to push into poverty on the street.  16 August 2014 (Making thugs wear cameras)  Making thugs wear cameras is just part of what is needed to curb their violence.  These cameras won't stop other abuses, such as searching people without grounds.  16 August 2014 (Canada-EU free exploitation treaty)  A leak shows that the secret proposed Canada-EU free exploitation treaty, CETA, has investor-state injustice comparable to TPP and TTIP.  For instance, if a city privatizes its water, it would be unable to make the water public again.  We should not be distracted by precisely where lines are drawn. All such treaties are fundamentally inimical to democracy, and we must abolish them, not sign more.  16 August 2014 (NYC worker-owned co-ops)  New York City is directing some of its spending towards worker-owned co-ops instead of businesses that profit mainly the boss.  16 August 2014 (Gov't malware web pages)  Even if the page you visit isn't malware, various governments can replace it with malware.  16 August 2014 (Iraq's new prime minister)  Iraq has a new prime minister, Haidar al-Abadi, but is there any chance he can win support from all sectors of the country?  The US proved it is possible to buy the support Sunni clan leaders, but it's not enough to pay them for a couple of years; one needs to keep paying them permanently. That may be worth the price.  16 August 2014 (Impunity of thugs)  Michael Brown's Death Was No Anomaly. We Cannot Stay Silent.  We must somehow end the impunity of thugs that attack citizens.  16 August 2014 (Verizon harassing customers)  Verizon is harassing phone customers to make them switch from copper lines to fiber cables that will be useless in a protracted emergency.  16 August 2014 (Modi speech condemns rape in India)  Modi focused a speech on condemnation of rape in India and calling for better treatment of girls.  16 August 2014 (Urgent: Disclose frack well chemicals)  US citizens: call on the EPA to require disclosure of the chemicals used in each frack well.  16 August 2014 (Urgent: Detroit water affordability)  Everyone: call on Detroit to implement the 2005 water affordability plan and switch on everyone's water.  16 August 2014 (Privatization of NHS)  Creeping privatization of Britain's National Health Service is resulting in corruption, waste, and injuries to patients.  16 August 2014 (Bullying)  Children are more likely to encounter bullying and harm while at school than on the internet.  16 August 2014 (Soccer world cup)  Busted: the myth that winning the soccer world cup leads to some economic benefit for a country.  Even if that were true, this would be a lousy way to make most people better off, since only one country can win. There are lots of better ways to use that same amount of money for the general good.  16 August 2014 (Glacial shrinkage)  The main cause of glacial shrinkage nowadays is human activity.  Way to go, homo sap! This will lead to growing scarcity of fresh water in the areas that get their water from glacial runoff, such as California and northern India.  15 August 2014 (UK gov't blocks wind energy co-ops)  The UK government talks up community wind energy co-ops but has tightened the rules, blocking new ones.  15 August 2014 (SeaWorld agrees to some changes)  Public pressure, criticizing cruelty to whales, has made SeaWorld agree to change some practices. Will it do enough?  15 August 2014 (Ferguson thugs attacked TV crews)  How the thugs in Ferguson intentionally attacked TV crews.  15 August 2014 (Human rights activists arrested)  Azerbaijan's tyrant has arrested human rights activists.  The excuse about NGO funding has been used to suppress civil society in several other countries, most recently Russia.  15 August 2014 (New Ferguson thug commander)  A new commander convinced the thugs in Ferguson to stop attacking the protesters.  15 August 2014 ("Stand your ground" laws)  "Stand your ground" laws have lead to an increase in number of killings, and in a racially biased way.  15 August 2014 (Urgent: CEO of Market Basket)  Customers of Market Basket: demand restoration of the CEO that treated workers and customers decently.  15 August 2014 (Treaty against weapons in space)  The US continues to oppose the proposed treaty against weapons in space.  15 August 2014 (Ferguson city government)  The black residents of Ferguson report that the city government is controlled by whites that persistently oppress them.  15 August 2014 (Abbott's business adviser)  Abbott's business adviser prominently called climate science a hoax and warns of an imaginary threat of global cooling.  I suspect he is being paid somehow to do this by the coal industry. I wonder if he has ties to those suppositories of all climate folly, the Koch brothers.  15 August 2014 (Attack by thugs in Ferguson)  Thugs, some armed with assault rifles, attacked protesters and journalists in Ferguson.  The thugs fired rubber-coated steel bullets at a protester with his arms in the air, and at journalists. They arrested journalists too.  Firing tear gas canisters at people's bodies is a tactic well known from Palestine, where soldiers sometimes succeed in killing people with these "nonlethal" weapons that way. That's not how tear gas canisters are supposed to be used, but try telling thugs that.  The repression in Ferguson highlights the effect of the general militarization of US thugs since 2001.  Thugs with military weapons now create a war-zone atmosphere at protests they wish to repress.  The thug in Ferguson who arrested a reporter, and bashed his head against a car window, was wearing armor that prevented identifying him. Handy, if you want to hurt and injure people and get away with it.  These thugs are the nascent occupying army of the plutocratic state. As the state imposes more "free trade" treaties to cement the power of big business and serve the interests of the 1%, it needs to repress the people somehow. Just stopping poor and minorities from voting may not be enough.  15 August 2014 (Research ethics)  Why research ethics are necessary even in the midst of an epidemic.  15 August 2014 ("Social media")  "Social media" seem to make many people more narcissistic.  15 August 2014 (Comcast)  Comcast seems to have a systematic practice of telling customers that some repair will be gratis, then charging for it anyway &mdash; unless the customer has a recording to prove it.  15 August 2014 (Enslaved workers in Abu Dhabi)  Interviews with the enslaved foreign workers building Abu Dhabi's branches of the Louvre, the Guggenheim Museum and New York University.  14 August 2014 (Cops are the 'Terrorists')  In Many US Communities, Cops are the 'Terrorists'.  14 August 2014 (US won't make effort to prepare vegetables for school children)  The US wants school children to eat vegetables, but won't make the effort needed to prepare them to be edible.  14 August 2014 (Shipping lots of oil by train is dangerous)  Shipping lots of oil by train is dangerous even at low speed, but US railroads want the trains to travel at 60mph.  14 August 2014 (The "culture of poverty")  Poor people have cultural patterns, but the "culture of poverty" is a fabrication designed to prove that poverty is caused by bad habits.  14 August 2014 (Exposing Walmart spin about its economic power)  Exposing Walmart spin about its economic power.  14 August 2014 (Musical recordings released solely under iTune)  When a musical recording is released solely under iTunes, it is off limits to libraries&hellip; and oppressive for individuals too.  The only way you should ever accept copy of that recording is by file-sharing, so that you do not agree to their unjust contract.  14 August 2014 (NSA's automatic counterattack device)  The NSA's automatic counterattack device presumes that the NSA is intercepting all internet traffic into the US.  14 August 2014 (Comcast and Time Warner "honoring" the FCC commissioner)  Comcast and Time Warner are putting lots of money into "honoring" the FCC commissioner in charge of reviewing their merger.  To such large companies in the same field should never be allowed to merge. That ought to be a no-brainer.  14 August 2014 (Child Asylum Seekers' Rights on Nauru)  Child Asylum Seekers' Rights on Nauru 'Systematically Violated'.  14 August 2014 (We may be able to stop the TPP)  We may be able to stop the TPP, but we must reject Democratic pressure to "give Obama a victory" which would be a defeat for the American people.  14 August 2014 (Russian military vehicles seen crossing border into Ukraine)  Russian military vehicles were seen crossing the border into Ukraine.  14 August 2014 (The occupation of Ferguson)  Appeals for "calm" are not enough; the occupation of Ferguson and other parts of the US by armed thugs must be ended.  Police Brutality Must Be Punished If We Want Real Justice for Michael Brown.  We need to unmilitarize the thugs, too.  14 August 2014 (Urgent: Investigate thugs of Ferguson)  Everyone: call on the Justice Department to investigate the thugs of Ferguson.  14 August 2014 (Urgent: Avoid killing sharks)  Everyone: call on Bumble Bee to take positive action to avoid killing sharks when it catches tuna.  14 August 2014 (Urgent: Ban fracking)  US citizens: call on Congress to ban fracking.  14 August 2014 (Tyranny in Egypt backed by the West)  Egypt Is in the Grip of a Violent Tyranny &mdash; with the West's Backing.  14 August 2014 (Nitrous oxide)  Nitrous oxide, as sold on the street, is hardly dangerous at all, so why so much effort to get rid of it?  Perhaps it is unsightly, like a hungry homeless person. Cities try to ban them, too.  14 August 2014 (Syria's disconnection from internet)  Snowden says that Syria's disconnection from the internet was due to a mistake that the NSA made while trying to install spy software.  14 August 2014 (Guatemalan president hires US lobbyist)  Guatemala's president, formerly a general who implemented US-backed repression has hired a US lobbyist to get more military "aid" from the US.  14 August 2014 (Ebola virus outbreak)  The current outbreak of Ebola virus continues spreading because of fundamental problems in the medical system in Sierra Leone which result in lots of avoidable deaths from less exotic diseases.  14 August 2014 (Water vapor in the upper troposphere has increased)  Satellite observations find that the amount of water vapor in the upper troposphere has increased over 30 years, as climate models predict global heating to cause.  14 August 2014 (Urgent: Object letting company reps choose staff)  US citizens: Tell Congress you object to letting company reps choose their staff.  14 August 2014 (Putin's rebellion)  It occurs to me that Putin may have provoked the rebellion in eastern Ukraine with the goal of firing up Russians to support him while he imposes Chinese-style censorship on the internet in Russia.  14 August 2014 (Netanyahu deserves to face the International Court)  Professor Schabas, appointed to lead a UN investigation of war crimes in Gaza, has said that Netanyahu deserves to face the International Court.  The information given does not justify the conclusion that Schabas is anti-Israel, but does suggest he has a preconceived view of the issue to be investigated. I agree with view, but his having it in advance may mean the investigation is biased.  14 August 2014 (Nixon and Kissenger sabotaged a cease-fire in Vietnam)  Confirmation: Nixon and Kissenger sabotaged a cease-fire in Vietnam in order for Nixon to win the presidential election of 1968.  Whether this literally constitutes treason, or just a betrayal, I am not sure.  I've seen accusations that Reagan's men sabotaged an agreement with Iran to free the US hostages in 1980 so that he would win the presidential election that year. I don't know whether this is true, but he certainly betrayed his country later by ransoming hostages Iran-supported Lebanese kidnapers by selling arms to Iran.  14 August 2014 (Israel represses both Jews and Arabs that oppose the war)  More than ever before, Israel represses both Jews and Arabs that oppose the war.  14 August 2014 (Gaza tunnels)  Hamas has always used its tunnels against Israeli soldiers, not against civilians.  The article also mentions several Israeli claims about the tunnels that were erroneous or fabricated.  14 August 2014 (Right wing demonstrators in Israel)  Right wing demonstrators in Israel boast of killing all the children in Gaza. (That is not in fact the case, but apparently they wish it were.)  A peace demonstration was banned, but hundreds came anyway.  14 August 2014 (DEA bribed an Amtrak secretary for 20 years )  The DEA bribed an Amtrak secretary for 20 years to get passenger name records rather than try to subpoena them.  I refuse to take Amtrak because it demands passengers show ID. Please join me in taking buses that don't demand ID instead of Amtrak for the distances for which ground transport is possible.  14 August 2014 (Gaza a seaport)  Israel agreed to allow Gaza a seaport, but has violated the agreement thus far.  Maybe EU control of shipping offers a compromise to open commerce and travel by sea.  14 August 2014 (A computer system to detect people who are feeling stress)  Chinese research seeks to develop a computer system to detect people who are feeling stress, so as to arrest them.  Knowing about this system of surveillance will make some people feel stressed.  13 August 2014 (Urgent: Tighten power plant CO2 rules)  US citizens: call on the EPA to make power plant CO2 rules tighter.  13 August 2014 (Urgent: Corporate political spending rule)  US citizens: call on the SEC to adopt the rule to make publicly traded corporations declare political spending.  13 August 2014 (Urgent: Stop private prison transfers)  US citizens: call on state governors to stop transferring prisoners to private prisons out of state.  13 August 2014 (UK and US torture collusion)  The UK government quashed torture lawsuits by saying that admitting the facts would embarrass the US. Then it began lobbying the CIA to stop the US Senate from acknowledging the torture, because if it did, that would pull the rug out from under the UK's self-serving argument.  13 August 2014 (The massacre of protesters in Egypt)  Human Rights Watch accuses the Egyptian army of intentionally massacring protesting Morsi supporters.  13 August 2014 (Businesses allowed to vote)  Some Australian cities allow businesses to vote in local elections.  This is the logical progression from the Corporations United decision*. In fact, why allow mere humans to vote at all? Allowing businesses to appoint officials directly is the logical end of plutocracy.  * The organization is officially called "Citizens United", but I prefer to call it what it is rather than repeat its falsehood.  13 August 2014 (Undocumented migrants in prison)  The Obama regime is citing the supposed "threat of terrorism" as a reason to keep undocumented migrants in prison rather than release them while their cases are heard.  Because I believe in equal rights, I don't think that this is even worse for being applied to women and children. It is equally bad to do this to men.  13 August 2014 (War between Israel and Hamas a draw)  Uri Avnery: the war between Israel and Hamas has come out a draw, and now Israel has to negotiate with Hamas.  12 August 2014 (Russia's "humanitarian aid" convoy)  Ukraine says that Russia's "humanitarian aid" convoy will be allowed into Ukraine if the Red Cross inspects and approves its contents.  12 August 2014 (Authoritarian wins Turkish election)  Authoritarian Erdogan won the election for president of Turkey, by less than was expected.  12 August 2014 (Seed library)  The seed library in Pennsylvania may in fact be legal, but these laws need to be changed to protect sharing of nonpatented seeds.  12 August 2014 (Being black or Latino in the US)  In the US today, if you're black or Latino, having a thug assume you're committing a crime is a rite of passage.  12 August 2014 (CIA and NSA-funded report)  A CIA and NSA-funded company made a report claiming that al Qa'ida learned about resisting tracking from the Snowden revelations, though in fact it was developing countermeasures years before.  12 August 2014 (Curfew in Baltimore)  A curfew in Baltimore seems to presume that anyone under 16 who is out at night is being neglected by her parents.  12 August 2014 (UK welfare "reform")  The UK government is firmly determined to "reform" welfare to the point where the poor will starve, and claims that they are great for the poor.  12 August 2014 (US deaths from lack of medical care)  1.3 Americans have died per day from fighting wars, since 2001. 120 die per day from lack of medical care. Why don't the latter get as much concern?  12 August 2014 (The thug that shot Michael Brown)  The thug that shot Michael Brown seems to have fabricated a false accusation as an excuse.  Police officers are simply not credible witnesses about such events, because they are accustomed to lying in court.  Ferguson thugs shot protesters and bystanders with wooden bullets that wound people.  12 August 2014 (UK's arms exports to Israel)  The UK says it will suspend some arms exports to Israel if Israel resumes fighting in Gaza.  12 August 2014 (Man burnt alive by thugs)  At the Goldcorp (Canadian) mine in Guatemala, a local man who tried to complain was burnt alive by the company thugs.  12 August 2014 (Porpoise species facing extinction)  The smallest porpoise species, found in the Sea of California, is facing extinction due to gill netting.  12 August 2014 (Urgent: Reject 2,4-D resistant corn)  US citizens: Tell the USDA not to allow 2,4-D resistant corn.  12 August 2014 (Long spells of heat or rain)  Spells of heat or rain that lasts for weeks have become twice as common since 2000, due to measurable changes in the behavior of the jet streams.  All this is due to global heating.  12 August 2014 (Ukrainian Neo-Nazis)  Ukrainian Neo-Nazis, organized as militia units, are leading the attack against pro-Russian rebels.  12 August 2014 (Bullying)  Bullying is bullying, on the internet or off it.  Perhaps teenagers would self-harm less if our society did not make life so precarious.  12 August 2014 (Who does the US save?)  Who does the US save, and who does the US allow to be oppressed?  12 August 2014 (Over 65,000 Gazans made homeless)  More than 65,000 people in Gaza are homeless because their homes were destroyed.  12 August 2014 (Statements by Clinton and Netanyahu)  Can you tell which statements were made by Clinton and which by Netanyahu?  12 August 2014 (Making it illegal to be homeless)  No Safe Place: How [US] Cities Are Making It Illegal to be Homeless.  12 August 2014 (Iran bans sterilization)  Iran has banned sterilization in a campaign to pressure people to have more children. It will fall most heavily on those who can't afford to travel abroad for an operation.  I can understand that people would not want to have children in Iran. What if they are daughters?  12 August 2014 (Antisemitism boosted by occupation)  Israel's identification of criticism of the occupation of Palestine with antisemitism was meant to suppress the former using the odium of the latter. It worked for a while, but now it has backfired: the odium of the occupation is boosting antisemitism.  12 August 2014 (Emissions estimates for Keystone XL)  A new analysis estimates that the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline will result in 120 million tons of extra annual CO2 emissions, not merely 30 million.  This is because it would result in a lower price for oil, which would encourage users to burn oil rather than invest in alternatives.  Although this is a small fraction of what the human world emits, it is an investment in increasing the emissions, when what we need to do is invest in decreasing them. We must also end the subsidies for oil. Better an increase in price now, than a big jump in price in 5 years.  12 August 2014 (US whitewash of killings of civilians)  Amnesty International criticizes the US for whitewashing killings of Afghan civilians.  That the Taliban are even worse is no excuse, because they are no standard of comparison.  12 August 2014 (Bottle water from California)  A large part of US bottle water is shipped from California, which has a severe drought.  I just about never buy a bottle of water in the US or other countries where tap water is potable. Why pollute the environment by being a sucker?  12 August 2014 (Media coverage of climate scientists)  The tiny fraction of climate scientists who deny that human activities cause global heating report much more media coverage than the ones who agree with the consensus.  12 August 2014 (Iraq under Maliki won't work)  Obama tried persistently to unite Iraq under Maliki's government, but he has recognized that this won't work.  Kurdistan makes a much better ally, since it is a nation and has an army that will fight for something other than pay or hatred.  12 August 2014 (Striking Bangladeshi workers paid)  The Bangladeshi workers on hunger strike received their back pay.  The article does not mention one of the reasons these workers are mistreated so much: the "flexible" system of subcontracting that makes it easy to move production from one subcontractor to another. We must make the shell companies that put their names on these goods responsible for the actions of their supply chain.  11 August 2014 (Australian Liberal Party registered domain names that use "Abbott lies")  The Australian Liberal Party registered domain names that use "Abbott lies", acting like the "pregnancy counselors" that try to distract women away from abortion clinics.  11 August 2014 (Thug shot an unarmed black teenager)  A thug in St Louis shot an unarmed black teenager for no obvious reason, triggering a big protest in his neighborhood.  11 August 2014 (Indigenous women organize to fight extractive industries)  Indigenous women organize to fight extractive industries promoted by governments that have sold out.  11 August 2014 (Boycotting Israel)  Don't lump boycotting Israel together with antisemitism.  11 August 2014 (Pakistan's gov't banned an opposition protest march)  Pakistan's government has banned an opposition protest march.  11 August 2014 (UK censored a report on house prices)  The UK censored a report on house prices, apparently to cover up the effect of fracking.  The UK government is not as blatant in its support of fossil fuels as the Australian and Canadian governments, but it is persistent.  11 August 2014 (Racism in the US)  Racism still exists the US, but people grasp at straws to argue it isn't really racism.  11 August 2014 (Facebook tracks everyone's browsing through "Like" buttons)  Facebook tracks everyone's browsing through "Like" buttons. A scandal has erupted because Facebook says it will use that data to choose what ads to show people.  How Facebook uses that data is a distracting side issue. The real injustice is that Facebook (and other companies) collect this data at all. That practice should be prohibited by law.  You can protect yourself from this particular surveillance mechanism by using a browser such as  IceCat that blocks the things that do the surveillance.  11 August 2014 (New York Times recognizes that torture is really torture)  10 years later, the New York Times recognizes that torture is really torture even if committed by the US government.  11 August 2014 (All users of internet cafes to show their identity)  Russia has joined China in requiring all users of internet cafes to show their identity. This policy is part of repressing dissent.  If you are in Russia, you can help resist Putin's repression by leaving your own wifi network unencrypted.  The EFF is developing a system that allows you to have your private encrypted wifi network plus a secondary unencrypted one for anyone passing by.  I am somewhat unhappy that they call it "open", but it's a good project despite the name.  11 August 2014 (Hamas threatened to increase its ineffective rocket attacks)  Hamas threatened to increase its ineffective rocket attacks on Israel unless the siege is ended.  It suits both Hamas and Israel to treat these rocket attacks as a big danger.  11 August 2014 (Our Economic Model Is at War with Life on Earth)  Naomi Klein: 'Our Economic Model Is at War with Life on Earth'.  11 August 2014 (Besieged Yazidis escaped)  20,000 or more besieged Yazidis escaped from Isis encirclement.  It is not clear whether US attacks helped make this possible.  10 August 2014 (Urgent need for secularism)  What the world needs now is secularism, and urgently.  10 August 2014 (Obama undermines law against torture)  When Obama talks about "banning" torture, which is illegal, and fails to prosecute torturers, the effect is to undermine the law against torture and make torture a mere matter of policy.  10 August 2014 (Insecurity of Apple computers)  China has excluded some Apple computers from the list approved for government purchases, on grounds of insecurity.  This is very wise. Apple computers have no security against Apple itself.  10 August 2014 (Vicious US Christians)  Some US Christians are as vicious as ISIS.  10 August 2014 (Slot machines)  US casinos get most of their money from slot machines made so addictive and "smooth" that people can get lost in them for hours or days.  I have sometimes wanted to get lost in playing a machine. Rather than going to a casino, I played a game on a computer &mdash; that cost me nothing. Free software games are available for this.  The idea of raising money for a state by legalizing casinos and taxing them made some rational sense for the first few states to do it. People from other states came there and spent money. Now that most US states have legalized casinos, this effect has disappeared; the result is that people spend money on casinos instead of some other business that also pays taxes.  It's amazing how shortsighted politicians can be when that enables a business to make money.  10 August 2014 (Legalized marijuana)  Since Colorado legalized marijuana, the rate of car accidents has continued its general downward trend.  10 August 2014 (US "allies" funding ISIS)  ISIS gets its funding from US "allies": Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait.  This seems to have been going on for longer than the article says: it seems that some of them were behind the start of the armed uprising in Syria, back when Syrians where still holding nonviolent protests for democracy.  10 August 2014 (Attacks on medical facilities in Gaza)  Amnesty International says there is mounting evidence of intentional Israeli attacks on medical facilities and workers in Gaza.  10 August 2014 (Security vs National Security)  The US has repeatedly squandered opportunities to make the world less vulnerable to nuclear destruction.  The article has a certain one-sidedness, as is often found in articles whose main point is to criticize the US. For instance, it tries to suggest that the US was in the wrong in planning for war with Japan in 1941 (though nothing forced Japan to start that war). Japan in 1941 was in the process of conquering China by means of a stream of atrocities; that's why the US stopped selling Japan the materials Japan needed in order to continue that conquest.  10 August 2014 (Censored computing services)  Chinese companies now offer censored computing services to people outside China.  10 August 2014 (Egypt bans a political party)  Egypt banned the Muslim Brotherhood's political party.  I would hardly agree with that party on anything, but banning a party is an act of tyranny.  10 August 2014 (Urgent: Block corporate tax-deserters)  US citizens: call on Obama to block corporate tax-deserters.  10 August 2014 (Urgent: People's Climate March)  In the US: join or support the People's Climate March.  10 August 2014 (Mexico to privatize oil extraction)  Mexico has made the disastrous decision to privatize oil extraction.  If this needs "investment", I am sure the Mexican state would come out better by doing the investment itself. This sort of claim is the basis for most privatizations, and nearly all of them do harm to all but their investors.  10 August 2014 (Reactor 3 at Fukushima)  Decommissioning reactor 3 at Fukushima will be more difficult than supposed, because it appears that nearly all the fuel rods melted down.  10 August 2014 (Network neutrality violation)  The four main US ISPs are accused of violating the one network neutrality rule that remains in effect.  10 August 2014 (Ukraine missiles kill civilians)  Ukraine fired inaccurate missiles at a rebel missile launcher operating near civilians, and this killed civilians.  10 August 2014 (Drugs winding up in waterways)  Drugs that many humans take, and excrete, wind up in waterways and harm wildlife. Perhaps we should choose drugs with a view towards reducing these effects.  10 August 2014 (Airline prices)  Airline prices are falling and this will cause an increase in CO2 emissions caused by flights.  10 August 2014 (Hamas demands end of siege)  Hamas refused to extend the temporary cease fire, demanding an end to the siege of Gaza.  A siege is an act of war, just as much as firing a rocket or dropping a bomb. Declaring a free-fire zone inside Gaza and shooting at anyone who goes there is also an act of war. If Israel wants a buffer zone, it should create that buffer zone inside Israel's borders.  The tunnels built by Hamas could be used to attack civilians or soldiers, but Hamas uses them to attack soldiers. And taking soldiers prisoner is not "kidnapping". However, the rockets launched by Hamas against civilians are war crimes.  More about the dishonest terminology used by Israel and Hamas.  10 August 2014 (Bangladeshi clothing workers)  1600 Bangladeshi clothing workers occupied their factories because they have not been paid for months.  The thugs are on the company's side.  10 August 2014 (Walmart in Africa)  The US is trying to subject parts of Africa to Walmart domination.  This generally results in lower prices paid to farmers and other producers because they have to accept what Walmart is willing to pay them.  10 August 2014 (Right-wing verbal tactics)  The verbal tactics right-wing politicians use when an aggressive falsehood is caught out.  10 August 2014 (Response to Israel's aggressions)  Many Europeans are responding to Israel's repeated aggressions by hating all Jews.  Antisemitism was suppressed for decades because it was condemned by a large part of society, in response to Nazi genocide. My mother told me about the regular antisemitism she experienced in New York in the 1930s, but I have almost never encountered it. (I am Jewish by ethnicity, and the fact that I am an Atheist would not make antisemites forgive me for that.) Now it seems that suppression has ended, antisemitism has come back. Israel's actions are to blame.  It is not rational to condemn all Jews for Israeli aggression. When people with a valid cause attack an illegitimate target, it makes the situation worse. Israel's killing of Arab civilians did that, and antisemitism will do it again.  10 August 2014 (Obama defends CIA chief)  Obama Defends CIA Chief John Brennan Amid Resignation Demands.  09 August 2014 (Max Schrems fights Facebook)  Max Schrems' persistent fight against Facebook's monstrous surveillance engine.  09 August 2014 (Professors doing false research)  Temple University distanced itself from the bogus study that found false "savings" from private prisons. That's not enough &mdash; universities must not allow their professors to do false research for pay.  09 August 2014 (Opponents of abortion rights)  Even opponents of abortion rights don't really believe that abortion is murder.  They use the slogan to talk themselves into a frenzy so they can aggress against women's rights.  09 August 2014 (Smothering overprotection of children)  Americans should stop freaking out when they see children in parked cars.  The US has a general pattern of smothering overprotection of children.  It is normal for children to leave the house and play together without adults. It used to be normal in the US for children to walk some miles to school by themselves.  09 August 2014 (Malaysia flight 17 attacked by cannon fire)  Reports of evidence that Malaysia flight 17 was attacked by cannon fire from fighter planes.  I have not seen these claims anywhere else. If they are confirmed, it would change everything about the issue.  09 August 2014 (Wisconsin's supreme court)  Wisconsin's supreme court is not conservative, it's right-wing radical.  09 August 2014 (Isis is conquering parts of Kurdistan)  Isis is conquering parts of Kurdistan with the help of heavy US weapons captured from the disintegrating Iraqi army.  Who Are the Yazidis And Why Is Isis Hunting Them?  Obama announced he will launch air strikes to prevent genocide.  That is a valid reason for war, and supporting Iraq in defense makes it legal as far as I know.  I worry, however, that this US intervention will backfire just like the last one. In the long term, it would make more sense to give heavy weapons to the Kurds. They probably can be relied on not to lose those weapons to Isis.  09 August 2014 (Abortion better than a woman's suicide)  Ireland formally accepted that an abortion is better than a woman's suicide, but seems to be trying to take it back.  09 August 2014 (Hopelessness of survival after a nuclear war)  Making palpable the hopelessness of survival after a nuclear war.  What could possibly have excused dropping a nuclear weapon on Nagasaki?  09 August 2014 (Israeli troops)  Israeli troops left shit and words of hatred in Ahmed Owedat's home after destroying the appliances and stealing his life savings.  They did similar things in a girl's school while occupying it as a base to destroy houses all around.  These acts fit the general hatred of Arabs expressed by Israelis today.  09 August 2014 (Demand in China for shark's fin has crashed)  Demand in China for shark's fin has crashed, as many Chinese refuse to eat it out of concern for the danger of driving sharks to extinction.  Maybe similar education campaigns could end the demand for tiger bone and rhino horn.  09 August 2014 (Obama could save Argentina from the vultures)  Obama could save Argentina from the vultures with a simple order, but he has already capitulated to them.  07 August 2014 (Snowden allowed three more years in Russia)  Edward Snowden will be allowed to stay in Russia three more years.  I am sure he would rather be in Bolivia, but the US wants him to be in Russia.  07 August 2014 (Illegal coal mines in China)  A giant coal mine in China is illegally eating up a nature reserve.  To make sure Chinese people can't complain about this, China is imposing tight control on all Internet communications.  07 August 2014 (Wikipedia edits made by UK gov't)  The UK government edited Wikipedia to downplay cases where UK thugs shot people dead.  07 August 2014 (Walgreens to stay in the US)  Walgreens gave way to the pressure campaign and decided to keep its headquarters in Chicago.  One factor that may tend to encourage US companies to move their headquarters elsewhere is to take advantage of "investor-state" lawsuit provisions in existing and proposed free exploitation treaties.  07 August 2014 (US list of terrorist suspects)  Almost half the people in the US list of terrorist suspects have no connection to any known terrorist group.  Since that the US designates groups as "terrorist" arbitrarily, without a trial, some "known terrorist" groups may not really be terrorist groups.  07 August 2014 (US corporations planning to dodge taxes)  Dozens of major US corporations are planning to move overseas to dodge taxes.  Any politician who refuses to change laws to undo the effects of this is working for those corporations &mdash; which is treason.  07 August 2014 (CIA torture report unreadable)  The Obama regime crossed out so much text in the Senate's CIA torture report that it becomes unreadable.  Senator Feinstein threatens to punish the CIA by not publishing the report?!?  Isn't that exactly what the CIA would prefer?  If the senate is serious, it should stick an amendment into some must-pass legislation giving the senate full control over what it publishes in this report.  07 August 2014 (Kidnaped children of Argentine dissidents)  Mothers of murdered Argentine dissidents are finding some of their kidnaped grandchildren.  07 August 2014 (Death threats against Israeli dissident)  Israeli dissident Gideon Levy, who criticized the Israeli air force for callously bombing civilians, is receiving death threats from powerful right-wing politicians.  07 August 2014 (Mercury pollution)  Mercury pollution from industry and burning coal accumulates in the oceans near the surface and gradually poisons marine life.  07 August 2014 (The change in management of Market Basket supermarkets)  Workers and customers have joined to fight against the change in management of Market Basket supermarkets.  07 August 2014 (Civil war in South Sudan continues)  Civil war in South Sudan continues and aid workers are being killed.  07 August 2014 (Income Inequality Could "Capsize" the Economy)  Even Wall Street Thinks Income Inequality Could "Capsize" the Economy.  07 August 2014 (US Army Corps of Engineers agree to obey pollution laws)  The US Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to obey pollution laws with its dams.  07 August 2014 (Urgent: Do not reduce protection of manatees)  US citizens: tell the Fish and Wildlife service not to reduce protection of manatees.  07 August 2014 (40,000 Iraqis are stranded without water)  40,000 Iraqis of a minority sect are stranded without water, but face mass murder by Isis if they leave their mountain.  Mohammed said it is legitimate to lie if someone forces you to convert to some other religion. I agree: lying is less bad than killing, so when killing in self defense is justified, as in a case like this, so is lying. By this standard, the trapped Yazidis could agree to "convert", flee the area, then say they lied under coersion.  They would have to stay out of Isis's hands, however. Muslim fanatics do not apply the Golden Rule to their own fanaticism.  07 August 2014 (Australia orders dismissal of Save the Children staff)  Australia orders dismissal of Save the Children staff teaching children Australia for expressing sympathy with protesters.  07 August 2014 (US owes reparations to Guatemala's poor)  The US owes reparations to Guatemala's poor for the repression that it financed for decades.  I don't think that these reparations must obligatorily take the form of allowing Guatemalans to move to the US in large quantities. It would be fine to give them the means for a decent life at home.  07 August 2014 (Urgent: Stop opposing laws to label GMOs)  Everyone: call on Coca Cola Company to stop opposing laws to label GMOs.  07 August 2014 (Urgent: Oppose oil drilling in Arctic waters)  US citizens: oppose Obama's plan to allow oil drilling in Arctic waters.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: End coal lease give-aways)  US citizens: call on the US to stop giving out coal leases that are effectively give-aways to mining companies.  06 August 2014 (Criminalising possession of porn)  Illustrating the evil of making it a crime to possess pornography, a man in the UK was convicted of the crime of not knowing how to delete all copies of a disgusting video sent to him by a stranger.  I don't understand the pretext for banning pornography involving animals. If extreme animal rights activists demanded that, at least there would be some sense in it.  "Child pornography" should not be illegal either.  I wonder how long it will take for thugs to start carrying around kids they can fondle as they arrest people and beat them up. Then any photos of the brutality would be "child pornography", and the photographer would be sent to prison.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Block Pebble Mine)  US citizens: tell the EPA you support its decision to block Pebble Mine.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Protect wild bighorn sheep)  US citizens: call for continued protection of wild bighorn sheep from the danger of disease transmitted by domestic sheep.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Action to reduce CO2 emissions)  US citizens: tell the EPA that Americans are ready for strong action to reduce CO2 emissions.  06 August 2014 (Guantanamo prisoner approved for release)  Abu Wa'el Dhiab, a prisoner in Guantanamo, has been approved for release to Uruguay, but since that might not happen for years, he is hunger striking basically to death and suing to end force-feeding.  06 August 2014 (Market-driven world)  If you are sick of a market-driven world, maybe you still have some values that aren't aligned with plutocracy.  06 August 2014 (Right-wing militias in Ukraine)  Right-wing militias now helping Ukraine's army fight rebels might become dangerous once that is over.  06 August 2014 (Call for end to siege of Gaza)  Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson call for the UN to order an end to the siege of Gaza.  There is a 72-hour cease fire at present, but converting that into peace will be difficult.  06 August 2014 (Infectious diseases in the US)  5 infectious diseases that are more dangerous in the US than Ebola, in terms of how likely it is that you will get one and die of it.  06 August 2014 (India blocks proposed trade treaty)  India blocked a proposed trade treaty because it threatens food security for poor countries.  The argument that a "free trade" treaty would good because it "adds to the world's wealth" is fallacious even if it really does add to total wealth: these treaties, in today's plutocratic system, assure that all the increment goes to the plutocrats. It's another form of the "trickle-down" swindle.  06 August 2014 (Obama's threat to imprison Risen)  Democracy is at stake in Obama's threat to imprison reporter James Risen.  You can still sign the petition.  06 August 2014 (SWAT sent to disarm grandmother)  Why was a SWAT team sent to disarm a Texas grandmother with a shotgun?  06 August 2014 (Group makes news site delete article)  A news site indirectly owned by Comcast deleted an article about Comcast-funded astroturf organizing against network neutrality.  06 August 2014 (Russia threatens to block BBC)  Russia threatens to block the BBC web site for an interview with Siberians who wanted to march for Siberian independence.  I can understand why they don't want to be ruled by Putin, but why leave the rest of Russia behind?  06 August 2014 (Europe's forests)  Global heating is hitting Europe's forests hard.  06 August 2014 (Impossible hoops of UK "jobcenters")  Unemployed Britons describe the impossible hoops of the "jobcenters" that were set up to create excuses to punish them.  I think they would advance their rights more if they got together and held a sit-in in front of a jobcenter, demanding to be put in prison. Civil rights protesters showed their contempt for unjust law by filling the jails; why not the unemployed?  But they have to refuse to do any work while in prison that the state would profit from.  06 August 2014 (Abbott "fighting terrorism")  Abbott proposes a broad attack on human rights in Australia in the name of "fighting terrorism".  06 August 2014 (Chicken sold in UK contaminated)  Most of the chicken sold in the UK is contaminated with campylobacter, which causes stomach illness that is sometimes fatal. Hygiene standards are evidently not good enough.  Either it is the same in the US, or it would be the same if standards are lowered. This is part of the reason why the US proposal to reduce inspection standards is so bad. Only under plutocracy are such crazy "economies" proposed.  06 August 2014 (Lawsuit against Facebook)  A class-action lawsuit against Facebook for violating privacy adds up to 8 million euros.  I agree with the plaintiffs in spirit, but the victory they aim for would take the form of limiting the use of giant data bases. That isn't enough to give us privacy where we really need it. We need to prevent the accumulation of giant data bases about people.  In particular, don't be a used of Facebook at all.  06 August 2014 (Fertilizer runoff in Lake Erie)  Fertilizer runoff has led to a toxic algae bloom in Lake Erie.  The waste of fertilizer will haunt us too, as supplies of some chemical fertilizers are running out.  06 August 2014 (Seed libraries)  Libraries around the US are starting to lend traditional seeds as well as books, but Pennsylvania says it presents a danger of "terrorism".  06 August 2014 (For-profit home health care)  In the US, for-profit home health care agencies working for Medicare cost more and provide worse care.  This is natural. Their profit has to come out of the patients and the public. Privatizing a public service is nearly always harmful unless it enables the public to buy directly from a competitive market.  06 August 2014 (US inequality)  New figures from the Commerce Department show that US inequality growth is even more than was believed.  06 August 2014 (ALEC recruiting states to try to block EPA)  ALEC is recruiting states to try to block the EPA from regulating CO2 emissions from electric plants.  ALEC is funded by fossil fuel companies and the Koch brothers, and their agenda is to make us burn as much fossil fuel as possible and run at high speed into climate disaster.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Demanding an end to nuclear weapons)  US citizens: support the Marshall Islands in demanding an end to nuclear weapons.  06 August 2014 (A religious exception to laws restricting abortion)  The Satanic Temple demands a religious exception to laws restricting abortion.  06 August 2014 (US developing a palm-sized surveillance drone)  The US is developing a palm-sized surveillance drone.  06 August 2014 (Systematic Israeli lies)  Chris Hedges describes systematic Israeli lies about types of violent events he witnessed.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Protecting Puget Sound from oil tanker traffic)  US citizens: Support protecting Puget Sound from oil tanker traffic.  06 August 2014 (A cunning loanshark)  A cunning loanshark sells furniture to US soldiers at elevated prices, lending them money, then sues them in a state where they can't go, so that they always lose.  06 August 2014 (Activists report that undercover thugs harassed them)  UK activists report that undercover thugs harassed them to become informers. One says thugs threatened to prosecute her if she told about this.  06 August 2014 (Alan Gross aims to die within a year)  Alan Gross, sent by the US to try to give Cuban Jews internet access and imprisoned for it, aims to die within a year if not released.  I have little general sympathy for US meddling, which is often done with an evil intent, but Cuba's interference with people's right to communicate is wrong in any case.  06 August 2014 (How to get a good grade on US standardized tests)  The only reliable way to get a good grade on US standardized tests is to get the latest textbooks from the three publishers that make the tests.  Wealthy areas can afford to provide these books. Poor areas can't. So the tests are an excuse to call poor children stupid, and a scam to benefit those publishers.  06 August 2014 (Urgent: Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument)  US citizens: Support extending the Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument.  06 August 2014 (Thousands of criminal convictions based on bogus "forensic analysis")  Thousands of criminal convictions were based on bogus hair comparison "forensic analysis" by done the FBI.  Reportedly other kind of forensic analysis also turned out to be bogus.  04 August 2014 (Media bias over Ukraine and Russia)  Perspectives on media bias over Ukraine and Russia.  04 August 2014 (UK gov't determined to re-privatize a railroad line)  The UK government is determined to re-privatize a railroad line that made a lot of money for the treasury.  The income undermines the government's ability to claim it can't afford programs to help the poor.  04 August 2014 (US imprisoned Yunus Rahmatullah for a decade)  The US imprisoned Yunus Rahmatullah in Afghanistan for a decade without allowing lawyers to talk to him.  04 August 2014 (Treatment of asylum seekers designed to make them suffer)  Australia's chief immigration psychiatrist says the treatment of asylum seekers is designed to make them suffer, as a form of mental torture.  And not only mental, when you consider the confiscation of medicines, the violence, and so on.  04 August 2014 (Intelligence services enjoy effective impunity)  The intelligence services, effectively a fourth branch of government, continue to enjoy effective impunity while spying on all of us.  04 August 2014 (New York's jail for minors)  New York's jail for minors is a hell of violence.  04 August 2014 (Australia's proposed austerity budget)  Australia's proposed austerity budget would hurt the poor most.  That's what it was intended to do. Tony Grabbit is evil, but not incompetent.  04 August 2014 (UK to reexamine each planned weapons sale to Israel)  The UK will reexamine each planned weapons sale to Israel to ensure they don't support attacking Gaza.  Whether this is serious, we will see by the results.  04 August 2014 (Manipulation of the public through digital media)  Getting to grips with the danger of manipulation of the public through digital media.  Using mass media to manipulate public opinion and launch wars started before the 19th century. Remember the Maine, which sunk in Havana harbor due to an internal explosion, then provided the excuse for a media frenzy that pushed the US into war with Spain.  04 August 2014 (The choice to boycott Walgreens)  Many Americans don't have the choice to boycott Walgreens, because medical plans require shopping there.  04 August 2014 (Some Facts that Poverty-Deniers Don't Want to Hear)  Some Facts that Poverty-Deniers Don't Want to Hear.  04 August 2014 (Alabama's latest attempt to close abortion clinics)  Alabama's latest attempt to close abortion clinics has been overturned by a court.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Fire CIA director Brennan)  US citizens: call on Obama to fire CIA director Brennan and CIA agents that spied on Congress, and launch an investigation to prosecute them.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Suspend executions in the US)  US citizens: call for a suspension of executions in the US.  This should be a first step towards ending the death penalty.  04 August 2014 (Health care in Republican states)  Republican-controlled states that rejected Obama's health care plan have a lot more uninsured people, and it costs them a lot of money.  A US court overturned Obama's decision to offer tax credits for signing up in these states. This is going to cause suffering for a lot of people.  Republican legislators want to make life precarious at any cost, because the plutocrats profit from the desperation of potential workers. If this causes a state deficit, they will use that as an excuse to cut some other program that helps the non-rich.  04 August 2014 (Harper gov't nastiness)  A resource for Canadians: hundreds of nasty things that the Harper government has done.  04 August 2014 (Applying for 40 jobs a month)  Unemployed And Applying for 40 Jobs a Month: If You Didn't Laugh, You'd Cry.  04 August 2014 (Green Party)  In the UK, only the Green Party is prepared to reject the idea that billionaires' wealth is good for everyone.  04 August 2014 (How Israel engineered war in Gaza)  How Israel engineered and provoked the war in Gaza.  04 August 2014 (Jury nullification)  Americans can use jury nullification to protect future Aaron Swartzes and Edward Snowdens.  It's worth a try, if you find yourself on jury duty. But we need to push for more reliable solutions too.  04 August 2014 (Libya collapsing)  Foreigners are being evacuated from Libya, which is collapsing into chaotic war.  04 August 2014 (Poultry inspection rules)  The USDA has modified a little its plan to let poultry companies inspect their own products.  It is a step in the wrong direction, and making it smaller won't make it ok.  04 August 2014 (UK trying to censor torture report)  The UK government is trying to censor the US Senate torture report when it talks about the UK's participation.  04 August 2014 (Audits of Canadian charities)  Canadian Charities Will Survive Chilling Audits Of "Political Activities".  04 August 2014 (Russia wants Apple source code)  Russia wants Apple to provide secret source code.  This would show Russia how to extract data from an iThing just as Apple does.  04 August 2014 (UK stretching immigration laws)  By Expelling Isabella Acevedo, the [UK] Home Office Tears Another Family Apart.  The UK government is stretching and even breaking its own immigration laws to deport exactly the people it should be most willing to allow to stay, for no reason except trying to prove how harsh it is to migrants.  04 August 2014 (Front for right-wing lobbyists)  An organization that pretends to represent US small business owners does right-wing lobbying for the Koch brothers and big insurance companies without telling its members.  The AARP acts similarly &mdash; it lobbies for right-wing causes that its members, who are Americans old enough to retire, might not approve of. This is why I refuse to join the AARP.  04 August 2014 (Opposition to Keystone XL)  The Keystone XL pipeline is facing increasing opposition and increasing legal defeats.  I am not convinced that Obama really has decided to block it. If he had, why hasn't he done so? I think he is waiting for 2015 to approve it.  04 August 2014 (Regenerative organic farming)  Regenerative organic farming can cut a large fraction of humanity's greenhouse has emissions.  We would have to eat much less beef. I think we would all accept that inconvenience if we understood what the alternative is.  04 August 2014 (Dissidents against war in Israel)  Dissidents opposed to the war in Israel are facing persecution at every level: mob attacks on the street, threats of punishment at school, exclusion from employment, and threats of state punishment.  It reminds me of what I've read about McCarthyism in the US.  The New York Times accepts Israeli censorship of reporting about Gaza.  Reporters in Gaza, reporting by channels that bypass Israel, can report freely as far as I know.  04 August 2014 (NY Times on shoot-down of planes)  The New York Times says that anyone who couldn't distinguish a passenger plane from a military plane was "irresponsible and stupid" and "a war criminal". Except when the person is an officer in the US Navy.  03 August 2014 (US court ruling on Argentine debt)  100 economists called on the US government to take action to thwart vultures from attacking Argentina or any other country.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Support the Stop Corporate Inversions Act)  US citizens: support the Stop Corporate Inversions Act.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Impose an end to the siege of Gaza)  US citizens: call on Kerry and Obama to impose an end to the siege of Gaza.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Support access to contraception for women)  US citizens: support access to contraception for women in the US military.  04 August 2014 (Boat people told to navigate to India)  Australian officials told the boat people, imprisoned at sea, that they would be forcibly put into lifeboats which they would then have to navigate to India.  While imprisoned on the ship, they did not get enough food.  04 August 2014 (Israel bombed another UN school full of civilians)  Israel bombed another UN school full of civilians.  04 August 2014 (Human rights lawyer writes to Obama asking for support)  Human rights lawyer Thulani Maseko writes to Obama asking for support. Maseko is in prison for criticizing the government and the courts of Swaziland.  04 August 2014 (Israel spied on Kerry's communications)  Israel spied on Kerry's communications while he was making his futile efforts to broker a cease-fire in Gaza.  Netanyahu is treating the US with overt contempt, believing he has the US government on a leash. A couple of days ago he essentially told the US, "Shut up, you have no right to question Israel's decisions." The US government does not seem to have listened.  04 August 2014 (Urgent: Schedules That Work Act)  US citizens: support the Schedules That Work Act  04 August 2014 (California has declared a fire emergency)  California has declared a fire emergency, with fires now at the level usually seen only in September.  In 30 years, that will usually arrive in June, due to global heating.  04 August 2014 (The ignorance of right-wingers)  The ignorance of right-wingers knows no bounds. A language teacher in Utah was fired for writing an article about homophones.  04 August 2014 (The US empire)  How the US empire weakens the US and harms Americans.  03 August 2014 (Israel's "aim" of attack on Gaza)  Uri Avnery: Israel keeps changing the "aim" of the attack on Gaza, so there is always a reason to keep attacking.  To keep it going, the US has just sold Israel more ammunition.  The latest "war aim" is to destroy Hamas tunnels, which Israel claims are meant to attack Israeli civilians. Never mind the fact that they have only been used to attack soldiers.  It's not clear the Iron Dome rockets are effective at destroying Hamas missiles (which seem to pose little danger in any case), but they are great for making loud explosions that get Israelis scared.  Israeli civilians have talked themselves into a frenzy of fear based on a danger that is tiny. That frenzy is, in objective terms, no justification for them to inflict great harm on civilians in Gaza.  The casualties (killed and wounded) in Gaza, around 10,000 people, amount to half a percent of the population of Gaza (1.8 million). If 30,000 Israelis were casualties of Hamas attacks, Israelis would face the same level of danger as Gazans, and I'd agree they had a valid reason to be frightened.  03 August 2014 (Monsanto's attack on food safety laws)  Vandana Shiva explains Monsanto's world-wide attack on food safety laws.  03 August 2014 (Urgent: Walgreens)  In the US: call on Walgreens to remain a US company.  03 August 2014 (Tax on wealth)  The UK Labour Party is terrified that people might think it is planning to tax inherited fortunes.  That would be a tax on wealth. Taxing wealth is just what Thomas Piketty says we need to do.  03 August 2014 (The ice around Antarctica)  With the Earth's surface heating, and ice melting everywhere, it was a mystery why sea ice around Antarctica was increasing. Part of the explanation is that the increase is less than was thought.  03 August 2014 (Fracking)  In order for fracking to have a chance of leading a transition to cleaner energy, it would need a coherent plan to end use of coal and oil.  There is no such plan, because the backers of fracking don't really want to reduce fossil fuel use. They only want to extract more and faster.  This is aside from the point that fracked gas releases a lot of methane which makes its greenhouse contributions much higher.  02 August 2014 (Global heating is visible)  Global heating is visible in the change of which fish species live around Britain.  02 August 2014 (Politician claims rape accusations are a "fashion")  A Hindu-nationalist politician claims that rape accusations in India are a "fashion", in effect asserting it is unthinkable that rape could really occur in India.  02 August 2014 (Australia forced the Tamil boat people onto a plane to Nauru)  Australia forced the Tamil boat people onto a plane to Nauru with no warning and without informing their lawyers.  02 August 2014 (Staying sober under the monitoring of a sobriety bracelet)  People who committed crimes while drunk show a pretty good rate of staying sober under the monitoring of a sobriety bracelet.  This use of surveillance is legitimate because it is specifically targeted and because it is imposed after due process.  02 August 2014 (25,000 people in Detroit are cut off from water supplies)  25,000 people in Detroit are cut off from water supplies, and it is not clear that the mayor is going to treat the poor any better than the bankruptcy manager.  02 August 2014 (US denies citizenship to Muslim permanent residents)  The US denies citizenship to Muslim permanent residents and refuses to tell them why.  02 August 2014 (Urgent: oppose mergers of big companies)  US citizens: oppose mergers of big companies such as Comcast.  02 August 2014 (Hungary's government is slowly extending censorship)  Hungary's government is slowly extending censorship, much as Putin did until a couple of years ago.  02 August 2014 (Helping Companies Move Overseas To Dodge Taxes)  Wall Street Has Raked In Almost A Billion Dollars Helping Companies Move Overseas To Dodge Taxes.  02 August 2014 (72 companies have stopped funding ALEC)  72 companies have stopped funding ALEC, but ALEC still gets plenty from the Koch brothers, tobacco companies and Big Pharma.  Lots of Earth-broiling companies support ALEC.  Did Google ever stop funding ALEC?  02 August 2014 (US court demands Microsoft hand over client's emails)  A US court continues to demand that Microsoft hand over a client's emails stored in Ireland, without consulting Ireland.  Ireland could stop Microsoft from complying, if it had the guts.  02 August 2014 (New coal mine will probably kill The Great Barrier Reef)  The Great Barrier Reef is already sick, and the new coal mine that Australia plans to create will attack it in several ways, probably killing it.  02 August 2014 (US Banks still "too big to fail")  The GAO says big US banks are still "too big to fail".  02 August 2014 (Anti-gay laws in Uganda)  Uganda's latest anti-gay law was struck down as unconstitutional, but only on a technicality, and the old one that was imposed by British colonialists remains.  02 August 2014 (Unknown spider species)  The unknown spider species we are driving to extinction today might save your life if it survives. And wiping them out could make us starve.  02 August 2014 (War crimes in Gaza)  The Palestinian Authority should call on the International Criminal Court to prosecute the war crimes in Gaza.  Although Israel claims that Hamas uses UN schools for military activities, so far there is no evidence that it did so in the schools where civilians are sheltering. The UN reported finding rockets stored in UN schools that were closed and not in use.  02 August 2014 (Multiplayer video games)  The "social" aspect of multiplayer video games is an unhealthy society, totally structured to get people to play and pay.  While we have seen such things before, such as shopping malls as places to hang out, and the increasing number of holidays structured around socially-pressured gift-giving, they do involve a lot of social interaction on which no structure is imposed. This is a change for the worse; it could be producing millions of people who don't interact with their "friends" outside of the imposed structure.  02 August 2014 (UK cuts climate diplomacy budget)  The UK government, which does not want climate negotiations to succeed, has cut the budget for its climate diplomacy by 1/3 in recent years.  The UK government is working for fossil fuel companies and intends to prevent an agreement. That does not require much staff work.  02 August 2014 (Resistance to ISIS)  The inhabitants of Mosul are resisting ISIS.  02 August 2014 (Israeli artillery practices)  Israeli artillery practices are a recipe for hitting civilians.  Are the gunners sloppy and incompetent, or do they just not care about killing Arabs?  02 August 2014 (Investigation into CIA torture)  The Obama regime and CIA torturers are censoring the Senate investigation into CIA torture.  02 August 2014 (Force-feeding in Guantanamo)  Some prisoners in Guantanamo said they would accept force-feeding done in a way that doesn't amount to torture. Obama would rather torture them.  02 August 2014 (Whitewash by Yushukan war museum)  Japan's Yushukan war museum says that Japan was never an aggressor, and that Japanese troops never committed atrocities. It was always all the other side's fault.  Japan is not the only country to whitewash aggression and massacres in this way. Today Israel and the US do it. It is noteworthy how the Japanese army defined all Chinese men of military age in Nanjing as soldiers in civilian disguise; thus it can claim their execution was not a massacre. Did Bush and Obama get the idea from there?  01 August 2014 (Urgent: End bulk antibiotics use in farms)  US citizens: call on Congress to end bulk use of antibiotics in factory farms, before the resistant bacteria kill us.  01 August 2014 (Russia prohibits anonymity)  Russia has prohibited anonymous comments on web sites.  It has also imposed many other limits on Internet use, including arbitrary blocking of inconvenient web sites.  Of course, Russia is ruled by a tyrant, and this is what tyrants do. (I pity the poor fools in the Crimea that wanted to be under Putin's power &mdash; if indeed they were more than a bunch of armed gangs he had set up.)  What is more dangerous is that governments of "free" countries such as the US, France, Italy, and Finland also block web sites, and have laws such as the DMCA that lend themselves to political censorship.  A UK committee wants to ban anonymity on the internet.  01 August 2014 (Extreme weather in Siberia)  Extreme weather in Siberia has impacted salmon, causing bears to attack humans.  01 August 2014 (Defamation laws)  Zimbabwe's Constitutional Court struck down the law criminalizing defamation.  However, Cambodia is moving in the other direction.  01 August 2014 (More coral reefs damaged by Big Spill)  Scientists have found more coral reefs in the Gulf of Mexico that have been badly damaged by the Big Spill.  They say that not all reefs in the area were harmed. It makes sense that the oil was carried by currents in certain directions and others were spared. It makes for a good comparison.  01 August 2014 (US workers without sick days)  40 million US workers don't get paid sick days, and ALEC is fighting to keep it that way.  01 August 2014 (CIA spying on Senate Staffers)  CIA Admits to Spying on Senate Staffers. And breaking the security on Senate computers, too.  But worst of all is that they lied about it.  The CIA needs to be investigated by another Church Committee.  01 August 2014 (India suspends trials of GMO foods)  India has suspended trials of genetically modified foods for the sake of protecting its food security.  01 August 2014 (Lobbying against solar)  US electric companies are paying ALEC to push laws to obstruct installation of solar generation in homes and businesses.  01 August 2014 (London thug charged with murder)  An unidentified London thug will be charged with murder for a scandalous killing 9 years ago.  01 August 2014 (Massachusetts replaces "buffer zone" law)  Massachusetts has replaced its "buffer zone" law with a different way of preventing harassment of patients and doctors at abortion clinics.  01 August 2014 (Australia's prison for boat people)  Australia's prison for boat people is intended to make future boat people stay away, so it is intentionally cruel. About 1/3 of the prisoners have mental health problems.  One epileptic had seizures because the government took away her anti-seizure medicine and did not supply more. Some children are described as having given up eating because it was not worth living.  The prisons are cruel to people with non-mental illnesses, too. This article (mostly overlapping) informs us that the thugs confiscated eyeglasses and hearing aids too.  The Australian government representative was shocked people could doubt the benign intentions and good judgment of the government, which are of course beyond question.  01 August 2014 (The "public inquiry" into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko)  The "public inquiry" into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko will not really be a public inquiry. Even its conclusion will not be entirely published.  01 August 2014 (Greeks who shot immigrant workers acquitted of human trafficking)  Some of the Greeks who shot the immigrant workers whose pay they were stealing were acquitted of human trafficking.  01 August 2014 (Uganda's repressive anti-gay law)  Uganda's repressive anti-gay law is being challenged as unconstitutional.  01 August 2014 (Israel to increase its attacks on Gaza)  Israel intends to increase its attacks on Gaza, and is buying more ammunition from the US to kill more Palestinians.  01 August 2014 (Politicians want NATO to "respond" to non-armed "attacks")  Politicians want NATO to "respond" to non-armed "attacks" which might be nothing but propaganda.  If the response to a non-armed "attack" is made in kind, without arms, it does not require the formality of NATO, or any treaty. It would be nonmilitary cooperation between governments, which they can do without NATO.  It follows that this proposal is really about permitting NATO to launch a war in response to non-military action. That seems very dangerous to me.  30 July 2014 (UK proposes tax cut for the rich)  The UK's dooH niboR government is proposing a new tax cut for the rich.  It will grasp any excuse to claim it has no money for the poor, the NHS, and so on.  30 July 2014 (US-supported terrorism in Colombia)  Colombia's army and the government-supported paramilitares continue their terrorism and repression, with US support.  30 July 2014 (Corn engineered with Bt toxin)  Genetically engineered corn that makes Bt toxin has ceased to repel insect pests, in Brazil and in the US. Brazilian farmers demand compensation for the extra pesticides they had to use.  30 July 2014 (US collaboration in torture)  Yonas Fikre says the US had him arrested and tortured in the United Arab Emirates and apparently collaborated with his torturers.  It is not clear that Fikre can't return to the US. The article does not say he faced arrest (let alone torture) in the US. Perhaps therefore Sweden's decision not to grant him asylum was correct, since he can safely return to his home country.  But that doesn't excuse the US for collaborating in torture.  30 July 2014 (Malaysian Airlines flight 17)  Former US intelligence officials call on the US to show its evidence about Malaysian Airlines flight 17, or else stop claiming to be certain about what happened.  Above all they criticize the tendency to condemn Russia as if the rebels had intentionally shot down the plane (which it is clear they did not do).  30 July 2014 (UN school in Gaza bombarded again)  Israel bombarded a UN school again in Gaza, and has tried to pretend that Hamas attacked the school.  It is standard practice for the Israeli government to deny the facts to duck the blame for killing innocent Palestinians &mdash; one may as well assume such claims are false.  30 July 2014 (Australia to punish the unemployed)  Australia will punish the unemployed if they don't apply for enough jobs or if they send "unsatisfactory" applications.  If there are no jobs available in your field, you will inevitably be punished.  30 July 2014 (New Zealand's mountains)  New Zealand's mountains have lost 1/3 of their snow and ice since 1978.  30 July 2014 (Australian gov't bribery scandal)  Wikileaks reveals that the Australian government is covering up a bribery scandal by banning all public discussion of it.  30 July 2014 (Economic cost of worldwide disaster)  Delaying Climate Action Will Carry Heavy Economic Cost, White House Warns.  It's true, but the fact that one must cite economic losses as a reason to prevent worldwide disaster is a testament to plutocracy.  More explanation of the report.  30 July 2014 (What is "terrorism"?)  What is "terrorism"? Hamas uses tunnels into Israel to attack soldiers &mdash; which is war, not terrorism.  Israel bombards civilians, homes of the families of Hamas members, hospitals, and power plants &mdash; which is terrorism, not war.  With Blackouts, Food Shortages And Sewage in the Streets, Observers Say the IDF Either Targets Civilians Or Has Terrible Aim.  30 July 2014 (Unregulated "shadow banking system")  The unregulated "shadow banking system" vitiates the regulations that were intended to make banks more stable.  30 July 2014 (Spies, journalists and lawyers)  Pervasive surveillance in the US forces journalists and lawyers to use spy techniques to communicate with their source and clients.  Although the Senate is now considering a bill that would make it harder for the NSA to collect records in bulk, that would not prevent targeted investigations aimed at a journalist to find the journalist's sources. The approach of limiting access to giant digital dossiers is simply not capable of solving the problem. We must stop the creation of these dossiers.  Comparing the Senate bill with the toothless House bill.  30 July 2014 (Urgent: Tell Southwest Airlines not to gag passengers)  In the US: tell Southwest Airlines not to gag passengers.  30 July 2014 (Labeling products from Israeli colonies)  Several European countries now ask stores to label products from Israeli colonies in Palestine.  They ought to go further and ban commercial importation of all such products.  30 July 2014 (US sells coal for a pittance to mining companies)  The US sells coal for a pittance to mining companies, effectively a subsidy so they can export it to boost global heating.  Buy Low, Sell High: How Big Coal And The BLM Treat Taxpayers Like Chumps.  30 July 2014 (How Capitalism Is Cheating Young Americans)  How Capitalism Is Cheating Young Americans. (And young Europeans too.)  30 July 2014 (Israel has arrested 400 Israeli Arabs for protesting)  Israel has arrested 400 Israeli Arabs for protesting, or planning to protest, or relaying postings about a protest, or just being near a protest. Some get beaten bloody, some get interrogated without lawyers.  People who support peace are called traitors by the right-wing majority.  David Grossman (mentioned in the above article) still has hope that Israel will "grow up" as a result of this war.  Stranger things have happened, but having "the left" understand the majority right-wingers better is not the sort of progress that will help.  30 July 2014 (TaskRabbit)  If TaskRabbit Is the Future of Employment, the Employed Are Fucked.  30 July 2014 (US providing Afghan government with weapons)  The US is providing the Afghan government with more weapons than it can use, and many could fall into the hands of the Taliban.  30 July 2014 (Taxes for poor increase but decrease for wealthy)  Republicans passed a bill to let taxes for poor families increase but reduce them for fairly wealthy families.  30 July 2014 (How dangerous 5 pesticides are to endangered wildlife)  A court settlement requires the US government to investigate how dangerous 5 pesticides are to endangered wildlife.  30 July 2014 (General Mills has given Oxfam firm commitments)  General Mills has given Oxfam firm commitments to cut deforestation.  I'm generally skeptical that commitments by businesses are lip service, but if Oxfam thinks this will really solve the problem, maybe it will.  30 July 2014 (Hamas is "forcing" Israel to kill Palestinian children)  In the US mainstream media, you can get in trouble by showing too much concern for the killing of 1000 Palestinians, but it's fine to say that Hamas is "forcing" Israel to kill Palestinian children.  This is, of course, totally false. Israel could easily protect itself from the tunnels, and the rockets rarely hurt anyone.  30 July 2014 (Urgent: Stop offshore drilling licenses)  US citizens: call on the Department of the Interior to stop issuing licenses for offshore oil drilling.  30 July 2014 (Mississippi's abortion clinic)  Mississippi's attempt to close the state's only abortion clinic has been declared unconstitutional.  However, there may be more appeals.  30 July 2014 (Gaza's electric plant destroyed)  Israel destroyed Gaza's electric plant. This will make Gaza totally dependent on whatever electricity Israel chooses to supply.  30 July 2014 (Doctors banned from discussing guns)  Florida bans doctors from discussing the danger of guns with their patients.  29 July 2014 (Dating site experiment)  OkCupid did an experiment telling users they were compatible when its scores said they were not.  These pairs carried on with conversations, apparently not noticing their supposed incompatibility. I wonder how many of them formed relationships and how those worked out.  It's possible that this experiment constituted lying to the users, but I don't know whether that is true. It depends on what promises the site makes to users about how it judges compatibility, which are facts I don't know. If "flip a coin" is as good a method as its usual one, perhaps it satisfies the promises.  However, if a dating site's claim to being useful is its method for estimating people's compatibility, and that method turns out to be little better than chance, it seems to imply that the site is pointless.  More information about the experiment.  29 July 2014 (Urgent: Child refugees)  US citizens: Don't send back child refugees without hearing their cases.  29 July 2014 (Activists block train tracks)  After an oil train derailed in Washington state, activists blocked the tracks so no more could follow.  29 July 2014 (Israel's moral standards)  A former Israeli air force officer says that Israel's moral standards have collapsed. Actions that led to soul-searching 12 years ago are now done without a second thought.  29 July 2014 (Verizon "rewards" for more tracking)  Verizon offers customers "rewards" in exchange for more tracking.  This is why I think it won't achieve much to adopt a law that people "own" their personal data as property &mdash; it is too easy to convince them to sell it.  29 July 2014 (Urgent: Limit CO2 emissions)  US citizens: tell the EPA you support limiting CO2 emissions from coal power plants.  29 July 2014 (State laws promoted by ALEC)  ALEC is promoting state laws to remove all regulation from private "charter" schools and ban enrollment in Medicaid.  29 July 2014 (Religious freedom)  Why We'll Still Be Fighting About Religious Freedom 200 Years From Now!  29 July 2014 (Solitary confinement)  Solitary confinement often causes mental illness.  In addition, it must make dementia more likely, since it has been established that exercising the mind tends to delay dementia.  29 July 2014 (Diary from Gaza under bombardment)  A diary from Gaza under bombardment.  29 July 2014 (Tax-dodge haven in Gibraltar)  A Spanish union plans a protest in Gibraltar against its use as a tax-dodge haven.  I support their campaign against tax havens, but under the circumstances it can't help being confused with mere nationalism. If they could join with UK Uncut, they could separate it clearly from nationalism.  29 July 2014 (Enslavement of migrants in Qatar)  Despite a year of pressure, Qatar has made little change in its laws that more or less enslave migrant workers.  29 July 2014 (Domestic violence)  Domestic violence is a system of permanent enslavement, and the victims need special support in order to leave.  29 July 2014 (Urgent: Net neutrality public hearings)  US citizens: Call on the FCC to hold public hearings around US about net neutrality.  29 July 2014 (Urgent: James Risen)  US citizens: call on Obama and Holder not to imprison reporter James Risen.  Risen is ready to go to prison to avoid putting a whistleblower in danger. The US government is wrong to try to make this necessary.  29 July 2014 (Qatar World Cup)  Qatar World Cup: Migrants Wait a Year to Be Paid for Building Offices (for the event). The contractor went bankrupt and never paid them, so they are trapped in Qatar because they have no money to leave, and could be imprisoned because they no longer have the right to be in Qatar.  This is part of a general system that treats migrant workers so badly that some of them die from it.  You can punish the Qatari state personally by not taking flights on Qatar Airways, which is owned by the government of Qatar.  29 July 2014 (Threat to lawyers' and journalists' work)  Human Rights Watch and the ACLU say that lawyers' and journalists' work is threatened by US massive surveillance.  For the lawyers, encryption of the contents of email could be enough of a solution. However, journalists also need to protect their sources' identity, and surveillance of their communication metadata is enough to ruin that. I've stated the solution.  29 July 2014 (UK admits fracking causes damage)  The UK government admits, under pressure, that fracking causes environmental damage, but is mad to go ahead with it anyway.  29 July 2014 (Robots to care for the old and sick)  Isn't it strange that people say we need robots to care for the old and sick because there aren't enough people to do it, when so many people are unemployed?  This is prejudice and plutocracy at work, a desire to replace people with machines and leave more people destitute.  We should ban automation of many jobs, thus preserving work for people, until we institute an automatic personal income so that people don't need jobs.  29 July 2014 (Urgent: Treat domestic violence as a serious offence)  Everyone: tell the US NFL to treat domestic violence as a serious offence.  29 July 2014 (UK covered up massive losses in World War I)  The UK covered up massive losses in World War I with censorship and lies.  These losses were due to incompetent generals who lacked the moral courage to a plan when it had clearly gone wrong. With honest reporting, perhaps they would have been sacked.  29 July 2014 (The decline of wildlife)  The decline of wildlife is now causing a food scarcity which increases to war, crime and child labor.  There isn't enough Earth for so many humans and the wild world too. While we can do various things to assuage the conflict, we humans must reproduce less so that we stop overburdening our planet.  29 July 2014 (Neonicotinoid pesticides prevalent in waterways in the US)  Neonicotinoid pesticides are prevalent in waterways in the US midwest and sometimes reach toxic levels. They also persist from previous years.  29 July 2014 (Regulations for shipping crude oil by train)  Obama's proposed regulations for shipping crude oil by train are too little and too slow.  29 July 2014 (Official investigation of the Sep. 2001 terrorist attacks)  An additional reason to distrust the report of the official investigation of the September 2001 terrorist attacks is that they were based on evidence obtained by the CIA using torture.  This is in addition to the fact that the investigation was corrupted.  So please support the campaign for a proper investigation.  29 July 2014 (Mining takes precedence over human health)  A Colorado judge ruled that promotion of mining takes precedence over human health in Colorado law.  29 July 2014 (Destroying Hamas)  Destroying Hamas would make room for a more extreme replacement.  28 July 2014 (Fanatical Muslims lynch "heretics")  A mob of fanatical Muslims in Pakistan lynched a "heretical" grandmother and two of her grandchildren.  The thugs say they could not stop the mob. Will they arrest any of the murderers?  The government of Pakistan encourages this violence with its law against blasphemy, which violates basic human rights.  This stems, in turn, from the general arrogance of Islam, which we see also in the actions of ISIS.  28 July 2014 (Plans to waste unemployed people's time)  Even businesses object to plans to make unemployed people waste their time filing hopeless job applications.  28 July 2014 (Pesticide companies taint bee research)  Research on bees is tainted by involvement of pesticide companies.  The non-plutocratic way to fund this research is to tax the companies more, just as we must tax the pharma companies more and not let them fund tests of the effects of drugs.  28 July 2014 (Australia approves new coal mine)  Australia approved a new coal mine which will be the world's biggest. Thus we speed towards global disaster.  28 July 2014 (Tamil boat people brought to Australia)  Tamil boat people who were imprisoned at sea have been brought to Australia, but it is not clear how their asylum cases will be held.  In particular, it is not clear why Australia wants Indian officials to interview them.  28 July 2014 (Record temperatures in Arizona)  Arizona is hitting record temperatures, even at night.  One of the effects of greenhouse gases is to prevent the ground from cooling off at night by radiating infrared into space.  28 July 2014 (Abortion bans)  UN Warns Countries With Draconian Abortion Bans That They re Violating Human Rights.  Given the danger posed by human population increase, governments should provide abortion gratis and conveniently.  28 July 2014 (Everglades threatened)  The Everglades are now threatened by invasive plants and pests.  Has anyone noticed that global heating will drown the Everglades, over time?  28 July 2014 (Shredding environmental protections)  The World Bank proposes to shred its environmental protections by allowing governments to opt out from them.  28 July 2014 (ISIS imposes oppression of women)  ISIS has imposed Saudi-style oppression of women, ordering them to cover their faces and hands and not to travel without a man.  Women in the area oppressed by ISIS should carry guns under their mandatory loose clothing, and shoot ISIS supporters opportunistically.  28 July 2014 (Life getting more precarious)  The UN reports that life is getting more precarious around the world.  28 July 2014 (US conspiring with Yemen)  The US is conspiring with Yemen to keep Sharif Mobley disappeared in a secret location and refuse to tell his lawyers where to find him.  I expect they are torturing him too.  28 July 2014 (FBI hides its conclusions about drones)  The FBI conducted a mandatory study of how drones threaten civil liberties and privacy, and now refuses to tell the public its conclusions.  This is one more element in the US government's systematic contempt for the Constitution and human rights.  28 July 2014 (Entire Gazan neighborhoods leveled)  Israeli bombardment has leveled entire neighborhoods in Gaza.  28 July 2014 (Central American leaders meet with Obama)  Central American leaders implore Obama to spend billions to help them end gang violence, rather than on repelling the children fleeing from it.  One thing they need is to tear up the plutocratic treaty CAFTA.  28 July 2014 (US closes embassy in Libya)  The US closed its embassy in Libya due to the fighting between militias.  27 July 2014 (The practice of evidence-laundering)  The practice of evidence-laundering allows the US government to use NSA surveillance information secretly and secretly deny Americans fair trials.  27 July 2014 (Second bomber in Oklahoma City)  Was Kenneth Trentadue suspected of being the second bomber in Oklahoma City?  It may be true that someone said "suspects", plural, from confusion and that there was never video evidence of two people. People often make mistakes.  Whether or not there was a second participant in the bombing, it seems that Kenneth Trentadue was murdered in prison.  27 July 2014 (Russia is firing rockets to attack Ukraine)  The US published satellite photos with evidence that Russia is firing rockets to attack Ukraine.  27 July 2014 (The Energy-Efficient Way to Punish Putin)  The Energy-Efficient Way to Punish Putin &mdash; And Protect the Planet.  27 July 2014 (Israeli peace movement)  The Israeli peace movement is a small remnant of what it used to be, as overt racism and right-wing hatred takes over the country.  Peace campaigners face not only physical violence but also legal repression.  27 July 2014 (Assassination of Alexander Litvinenko)  The Ukraine crises convinced the UK government to stop blocking the public inquiry into Russia's assassination of Alexander Litvinenko.  However, the UK still needs a government that won't pander to anyone with money.  27 July 2014 (Global tax on wealth)  Piketty's proposal for global tax on wealth is his idea for saving the world from growing concentration of wealth that will lead either to a bloody revolution or the world of the Hunger Games.  27 July 2014 (Pakistan's biometric ID system)  Pakistan's biometric ID system oppresses most people but has not prevented false IDs.  27 July 2014 (Phillip Morris continues trying to bully Uruguay)  Phillip Morris, the tobacco company, continues trying to bully Uruguay (and by extension many other countries) into retreating from policies to discourage smoking.  This campaign is capable of killing millions of people.  The article alas spreads confusion when it uses the term "intellectual property". That term is pure confusion and should never be used. The tobacco companies use it as propaganda, and to repeat it is to support their propaganda.  27 July 2014 (Paul Ryan's poverty plan)  How Paul Ryan's poverty plan would be effective at increasing poverty.  27 July 2014 (US conscripting universities into the War on Sharing)  The US is conscripting universities into the War on Sharing.  Even if a university is unable to resist the pressure to bully its students this way, that does not excuse the university for failing to apologize and condemn the pressure.  The article repeats the enemy's propaganda term "piracy". Please don't refer to sharing by a term that means attacking ships.  27 July 2014 (Australia to escalate the War on Sharing)  Australia's wrecker government now proposes in addition to escalate the War on Sharing.  Mandatory internet filters were rejected when proposed for obscenity, but now they get another try.  27 July 2014 (Urgent: Stop listening to the Chamber of Commerce)  US citizens: tell Congress to stop listening to the Chamber of Commerce and broaden, not reduce, incentives for business whistleblowers.  27 July 2014 (Israel did not need to invade Gaza)  Israel did not need to invade Gaza and destroy the tunnels. It had many humane alternatives.  Even at its worst, an attack through the tunnels would have been tiny compared with the devastation of the bombardment of Gaza.  27 July 2014 (Prosecuted for sharing an academic article)  A student in Colombia is being prosecuted for sharing an academic article, under a law imposed on Colombia by the US.  Colombia should tear up that treaty.  27 July 2014 (TTIP will work against food safety and animal welfare)  A leak shows that TTIP will work against food safety and animal welfare by subordinating them to the convenience of companies.  TTIP stands for "This Treaty is Plutocratic". Corporations have too much power already, so any new "free trade" treaty is going in the wrong direction. We should instead cancel the existing ones.  27 July 2014 (US ranks near the bottom in energy efficiency)  The US ranks near the bottom in energy efficiency.  The funded campaign to keep use of fossil fuels as high as possible is evidently quite successful.  27 July 2014 (Urgent: Social Security offices)  US citizens: call for more Social Security offices, not fewer.  27 July 2014 (What is needed to end Gaza war)  Uri Avnery explains what is needed to end the Gaza war once and for all.  He also points out how Arab dictators' support for Israel is likely to create pressures for more extreme Islamism, a la ISIS.  27 July 2014 (ISIS blows up old mosque)  ISIS blew up an old mosque that is a major pilgrimage site. It is intolerant of all variations from its own form of Islam.  Saudi Arabia has been doing the same sort of thing.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Meat made from animals raised using antibiotics)  In the US: ask Trader Joe's to commit not to sell meat made from animals raised using antibiotics.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Protect intelligence whistleblowers)  US citizens: ask Congress to protect intelligence whistleblowers.  26 July 2014 (Republicans in the US Congress distrust climate models)  Republicans in the US Congress distrust climate models, and to make sure they can continue to do so, they voted to eliminate funding for validating climate models.  26 July 2014 (China's puppet substitute for the Panchen Lama)  Sooner or later, China's puppet substitute for the Panchen Lama will try to appoint a new Dalai Lama.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Restoring damage from the Big Spill)  US citizens: Tell the RESTORE Council to get moving on restoring the damage from the Big Spill.  26 July 2014 (NSA's cooperation with Saudi Arabia's oppression)  Describing the NSA's cooperation with Saudi Arabia's oppression.  26 July 2014 (Seven-Year Jail Term for Saudi Photographer)  Seven-Year Jail Term for Saudi Photographer. And many other journalists and dissidents.  26 July 2014 (The US west has been losing ground water fast)  In a 14 year dry spell, the US west has been losing ground water fast.  26 July 2014 (Domestic Violence)  The More Male-Dominated a Field, the Less It Cares about Domestic Violence.  26 July 2014 (Ebola infections have appeared in African cities)  People with Ebola infections have appeared in African cities.  26 July 2014 (Iran has arrested four journalists)  Iran has arrested four journalists, including three Americans, for no obvious reason.  26 July 2014 (Solar storm)  A solar storm in 2012 could have destroyed most electrical equipment on Earth, except it wasn't pointed at Earth.  We need to develop precautions, because sooner or later one will head towards us, and it could happen at any time.  26 July 2014 (Israel set the stage for wars in Gaza)  Israel set the stage for wars in Gaza by pulling out settlers and ground troops while maintaining the occupation in every other way.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Investigate Amazon)  US citizens: call on the US government to investigate Amazon for possible violations of competition law.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Keep Walgreens HQ in the US)  In the US: sign up to boycott Walgreens if it moves its HQ outside the US.  26 July 2014 (Urgent: Arms embargo)  US citizens: support Amnesty International in calling for an arms embargo on Israel, Palestine and Hamas; ask US govt to stop arming Israel.  26 July 2014 (Section 702 reform)  Why Average Internet Users Should Demand Significant Section 702 Reform.  Reforming law for snooping on our internet traffic is only a part of what we need to do to prevent a society of total surveillance.  26 July 2014 (UK moving files to ODF format)  The UK has adopted a formal policy of moving files to ODF format.  26 July 2014 (Israeli reservists refuse to serve)  Over 50 Israeli Reservists Declare 'We Refuse to Serve'.  26 July 2014 (Punishment for smoking pot in NFL)  The NFL punishes players more severely for smoking pot than for domestic violence.  I don't see why the NFL has any business punishing a player for using pot. Using a performance-enhancing drug might be considered cheating, but that doesn't apply to pot.  26 July 2014 (Privatized poultry inspections)  Privatizations of poultry inspections in the UK led to widespread unsanitary conditions, so that most chicken is contaminated by bacteria that can make people sick if the chicken is not properly cooked.  So why does the US government want to follow the same path?  26 July 2014 (Using drugs to execute prisoners)  US states trying to execute prisoners using medical drugs find it often does not work as intended.  I oppose the death penalty in general for other reasons.  26 July 2014 (100 protesters shot in Nablus)  Israeli soldiers shot 100 protesters in Nablus, killing several.  26 July 2014 (The US terrorist watch list)  The US terrorist watch list now has over a million names, and the White House can add people to it wholesale.  The definition of "terrorism" is so broad and weak that the list could be full of people who were never even suspected of terrorism, only of "terrorism".  More information.  These different watchlists and their different uses raise different issues. The no-fly list is punishment without trial, and could only be sustained in the US by tying the Constitution into a pretzel. (Sad to say, the Supreme Court is full of judges willing to do that.)  Asking a foreign country to torture someone is a grave crime, which by the way Obama pretends the US has stopped doing.  Making a note to scrutinize a particular person more in ways that don't require probable cause may be legitimate.  26 July 2014 (Israel admits shelling another school)  Israel now admits it shelled another school (in use as a refugee shelter) in Gaza.  As usual, Israel says it was because some Palestinians were firing from the school. I am skeptical; I don't think they could have done that without being noticed by the UN staff.  Supposing there are Hamas fighters shooting from a school, which is a war crime, that would not mean Israel is entitled to target the school with any and all weapons. Israel would have to use methods, such as direct fire, that are not likely to stray off target to hit civilians elsewhere on the grounds.  Israel justifies attacks on hospitals and schools by claiming that Hamas has facilities near them, but Israeli army headquarters is also near a hospital.  26 July 2014 (Russian opposition leaders sentenced)  Russian opposition leaders have been sentenced to prison for the minor rioting that resulted when thugs attacked their protest.  26 July 2014 (Rumor about ISIS-ordered FGM)  There was a rumor that ISIS ordered genital mutilation for all females, but ISIS says it never did this.  I doubted the rumor, as I knew that Islam does not require FGM.  26 July 2014 (Global heating denialism methods)  An interview with Naomi Oreskes about the methods used by organized and funded global heating denialism.  26 July 2014 (Airline passenger forced to delete tweet)  A gate agent for Southwest Airlines forced a passenger to delete a tweet that called the agent "rude", on pain of missing the flight.  Airline employees have the power to kick any passenger off a flight arbitrarily &mdash; all they have to do is claim they feel threatened. This power goes to the heads of some of them.  It's the same sort of impunity that thugs enjoy.  26 July 2014 (Valuing everything in terms of money)  George Monbiot: Putting a price on natural ecosystems is nonsense because the prices are fictitious, but it serves as an excuse to destroy these systems in favor of a business "worth" more.  More deeply, valuing everything in terms of money promotes the destructive values of plutocracy.  26 July 2014 (UK cutting renewable energy subsidies)  The UK government is cutting subsidies for renewable energy so can give more to nuclear power and fossil fuels.  26 July 2014 (French law to "fight terrorism")  France has proposed a law to attack many human rights at once in the name of "fighting terrorism".  Reporters without Borders condemns it.  26 July 2014 (Network neutrality and encryption)  Glyn Moody: ISPs that want to sort traffic into fast and slow lanes might join with Big Brother to ban encryption.  25 July 2014 (Corporate front group)  The American Council on Science and Health is a corporate front group that spreads spin about scientific issues that affect business interests.  25 July 2014 (Systematic spying by UK thugs)  UK thugs systematically spied on families campaigning for justice after relatives were killed or maimed &mdash; in many cases, by thugs.  More information.  It has a certain logic. People whose relatives you've shot might be plausible nuclei for opposition and you might want to sabotage their campaigns.  25 July 2014 (Students from elite US universities)  A Yale professor reports that the dynamic of elite US universities, and the competition to gain admission to them, produces students who don't dare risk failure or stray from a narrow path. He describes this as a bad education.  25 July 2014 (Civilians in UN compound shelled)  Israel shelled civilians sheltering in a UN compound.  25 July 2014 (Study of monkeys near Fukushima)  Wild monkeys 40 miles from Fukushima have blood disorders and some radioactive cesium.  The level of cesium they have might not be enough explain their blood disorders.  25 July 2014 (Tricking people into giving fingerprints)  Texas has started asking for fingerprints from everyone that renews a driver's license.  People are not required to give all the fingerprints, but the state tricks them into thinking so.  Demanding even one fingerprint is an injustice.  25 July 2014 (Israel testing weapons in Gaza)  One of Israel's motives for war in Gaza is so it can advertise weapons exports as "field-tested".  25 July 2014 (Investing in businesses to "create" jobs)  Texas invested $200 million in businesses to "create" 1600 jobs in Texas. It turns out that some of the companies don't really exist, aren't in Texas, don't pay their taxes, etc.  As a way to boost employment, this is ineffective. As investment, it wasn't very good either; it made only a little money for the state.  Raising the minimum wage would create a lot more jobs, but that would not please the employers that want workers to be desperate.  Paul Ryan says the US government should eliminate welfare requirements and give money to states to use to help the poor. Texas will give this money to companies to "create jobs", thus ensuring that the poor gain nothing from it.  25 July 2014 (Christians' homes stolen by ISIS)  When ISIS forced Christians to leave Mosul, it stole their houses and even their portable property.  25 July 2014 (CIA torture kidnapping flights)  The European Court of Human Rights convicted Poland of aiding CIA torture kidnapping flights, and ordered payment of compensation to the victims. The court ruled that US "rendition" (kidnaping for torture) is fundamentally illegal.  Unfortunately, this won't get them out of Guantanamo prison.  These men are accused of serious crimes which merit prosecution, but they deserve a fair trial, not a Guantanamo kangaroo court.  25 July 2014 (Help negotiate)   Obama offered to help negotiate a truce between Israel and Hamas.  Either this is a sick joke on Hamas, or Obama intends to pressure Israel to let the fighting stop.  24 July 2014 (Urgent: Privacy bills)  Citizens of Massachusetts: contact specific state legislators in favor of three privacy bills. If they don't pass by July 31 they will be dead for this year.  24 July 2014 (Security clearance interviews by robots)  Oh, Great: Robots Are Set to Conduct National Security Clearance Interviews.  24 July 2014 (Surveillance cameras in San Diego)  San Diego has set up a network of state and private cameras that any thug can watch at any time.  24 July 2014 (Web sites blocked in the name of world cup)  File sharing sites that governments blocked the name of the world cup have remained blocked and will probably be blocked permanently.  This is another incidental form of oppression dealt out by the world cup.  24 July 2014 (NYC responds to thugs' killing)  New York City is moving firmly in response to the thugs' killing of Eric Garner, but not questioning the deeper policy of jailing people over any minor crime.  When legitimate work is hard to get and pays too little to live on, poor people are compelled to break laws to survive. Plutocratic government uses that as an excuse to oppress them.  The only way to reduce annoying crime and black-marketeering is to stop running the economy for the rich. Everyone who can't work should get enough aid for a decent life, and jobs should pay a living wage.  24 July 2014 (Anti-abortion activists use bogus science)  Anti-abortion activists use bogus science to claim that medical abortions are dangerous, while pushing women into amateur abortions that really are dangerous.  I don't use the term "pro-choice" because it fails to defend abortion rights firmly. I also refuse to accept the term "pro-life" that opponents of abortion chose as a way to insult us.  24 July 2014 (Moroccan women protest)  Moroccan women protested the prime minister who told them to stay home and not work.  24 July 2014 (How the US chose war after 9/11)  Jonathan Schell: how the US chose war, and declared its readiness to overthrow any government to impose plutocratic rule.  24 July 2014 (Bombing the families of Hamas members)  B'tselem, the Israeli human rights organization, explains why the homes of the families of Hamas members are not military targets, so bombing them is a war crime.  The UN also criticizes Israel's war crimes in Gaza.  Note the Israeli representative's bogus claim that those families are "human shields". That would only be true if the homes were legitimate military targets.  In addition to bombing hospitals, Israel has systematically destroyed Gaza's civil infrastructure such as water and sewage facilities.  In the village of Zanna, every house was damaged by Israeli attack.  Shooting the water tanks had no possible motive except to make civilians' lives miserable. People in Gaza can't afford to replace the water tanks; replacements may be impossible to obtain.  Perhaps Israel destroyed Zanna as preparation for declaring it a free-fire "buffer zone".  24 July 2014 (Warning from gov't whistleblower)  A government whistleblower warns that the NSA grabs massive amounts of Americans' data, including email contents, by breaking into servers and communication links outside the US.  24 July 2014 (Urgent: Protect the right to boycott)  Citizens of Illinois, Maryland and New York: oppose state bills that would attack the right to boycott Israeli institutions.  24 July 2014 (Decriminalization of sex work)  More about why HIV researchers call for decriminalization of sex work.  24 July 2014 (The road to war in Gaza)  Israel, backed by the West, responded to the Palestinian unity government with repression, which helped get the current war started.  24 July 2014 (US-subsidized destruction in Gaza)  How America Finances the Destruction in Gaza &mdash; and the Clean-Up.  24 July 2014 (Urgent: End the siege of Gaza)  Everyone: call on Obama to pressure Israel to end the siege of Gaza as part of a permanent nonaggression agreement.  It is widely noted that the rockets launched from Gaza are an act of war and a war crime. The siege is also an act of war and a war crime. Let's end them both.  24 July 2014 (An ID card to identify you as a human being)  An ID card to identify you as a human being.  24 July 2014 (Spying on Prime Minister Erdo)  Turkish thugs have been accused of illegally spying on Prime Minister Erdo an and others, using falsified papers.  24 July 2014 (Urgent: Israeli bombardment of Gaza)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to oppose the resolution that would endorse the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  24 July 2014 (The world center of global heating denialism)  Anglophone countries are the world center of global heating denialism, perhaps due to the effect of the Murdoch media.  24 July 2014 (Hamas rockets)  Hamas rockets rarely seriously injure a person, but they have acquired economic clout by causing cancellation of many international flights to Tel Aviv.  Maybe now Netanyahu will agree to end the war that he started.  24 July 2014 (Great Barrier Reef is contaminated by toxic coal dust)  The whole of the Great Barrier Reef is contaminated by toxic coal dust from Australian coal export.  24 July 2014 (MP tried to force food down a fasting Muslim's throat)  A Hindu-nationalist MP in India tried to force food down a fasting Muslim's throat.  Even if you believe the MP's claim that this was only a complaint about the bad quality of the food served, shoving it into someone's mouth is hardly justifiable.  At least he did not try to do it via a tube through the man's nose, as the US military does.  24 July 2014 (Removal of a memorial to Korean forced laborers)  Japanese officials ordered removal of a memorial to Korean forced laborers.  23 July 2014 (Tamil boat people sought for interview)  India wants to interview the Tamil boat people who are imprisoned on an Australian ship.  23 July 2014 (Australian public transit cuts)  Australia's government is cutting funds for public transit to build more roads instead.  It's a natural choice, for a government that intends to boost fossil fuel use.  23 July 2014 (Emissions from US military)  The US military is responsible for around 5% of world greenhouse gas emissions.  23 July 2014 (Idea of "type A personality")  The idea of a "type A personality", with health problems due to stress, was constructed by the tobacco industry.  23 July 2014 (History of marriage)  How opponents of same-sex marriage distort the history of marriage.  23 July 2014 (Protest against tar sands mine)  Protesters blockaded a tar sands mine in Utah.  23 July 2014 (Iran delivers on promise)  Iran has finished the promised dilution of its most enriched uranium.  23 July 2014 (Koch brothers' political spending)  The Koch brothers spend hundreds of millions to influence politics, through a maze of twisty channels all different.  23 July 2014 (US stranding Yemeni-Americans)  The US is stranding Yemeni-Americans in Yemen by confiscating their passports while they are visiting there.  Then they have to wait as much as a year before they are allowed to return to the US.  23 July 2014 (UK's contempt for the environment)  The UK government demonstrated its contempt for the environment yet again by appointing a fracking flunky to head the Environmental Agency.  22 July 2014 (Urgent: Subway staff working while sick)  US citizens: tell Subway to stop making staff work while sick and stop firing them for going to the hospital.  22 July 2014 (Urgent: Poultry inspection rules)  US citizens: Tell Secretary Vilsack to publish the proposed rule for poultry inspection, and hold hearings on it.  The very idea of a secret rule proposal is offensive.  22 July 2014 (Al Jazeera building hit)  Al Jazeera says Israeli troops fired at its building in Gaza.  22 July 2014 (UK's terrorism law targets words)  How UK's Terrorism Law Targets Words, Not Just Guns And Bombs.  22 July 2014 (UK's "emergency" surveillance law)  Two UK MPs will ask a court to reject the UK's "emergency" surveillance law.  22 July 2014 (Time Magazine on the US economy)  Time Magazine says the US economy is doing great, judging based on the rich and the fossil fuel companies.  22 July 2014 (China using fake Twitter accounts)  China is using fake Twitter accounts, masquerading as famous people, to promote its occupation of Tibet.  22 July 2014 (Hottest June on record)  June 2014 was the hottest June on record.  22 July 2014 (Beef and the carbon footprint)  Giving Up Beef Will Reduce Carbon Footprint More Than Cars, Says Expert.  22 July 2014 (Executive order to protect LGBT people)  President Obama Signs Executive Order Protecting LGBT People from Workplace Discrimination.  22 July 2014 (Violent pogroms against Arabs)  Violent pogroms against Arabs are spreading in Israel as many say they want to exterminate the inhabitants of Gaza.  22 July 2014 (Call for end to bombardment of Gaza)  Gush Shalom calls for an end to the bombardment of Gaza.  22 July 2014 (Climate models)  It turns out that climate models accurately model the rate of Earth's surface heating, when not fooled by El Ni&ntilde;o/La Ni&ntilde;a.  22 July 2014 (Omniscient state that supports the rich)  If you stand for freedom or resist the rich, you have something to fear from an omniscient state that supports the rich.  22 July 2014 (Right-Wing global heating deniers)  Some right-wing global heating deniers are driven to their delusion by an ideological opposition to using collective action to solve any problem.  Collective action through the state is also the way to stop plutocrats from pushing most people into poverty, which is another reason those plutocratist politicians hate collective action.  22 July 2014 (UK plans another attack on the natural world)  The UK plans another attack on the natural world, both wildlife and the Earth's climate, proposing a legal requirement to extract the maximum amount of fossil fuel.  22 July 2014 (High-Profile terrorist plots)  Human Rights Watch finds that most of the high-profile terrorist plots that the US prosecutes were stimulated by the US government, and the "perpetrators" were often reluctant.  The effect is systematic injustice, but it suits those that hate our freedoms and are in a position to take them away by changing our laws.  22 July 2014 (Urgent: US National Monuments)  US citizens: call on the Senate to reject Republican plans to block new US National Monuments.  22 July 2014 (Antedated "predictions")  How the Internet makes it easy to create antedated "predictions" for fraud.  22 July 2014 (Urgent: Support the Paycheck Fairness Act)  US citizens: support the Paycheck Fairness Act.  More information about it.  22 July 2014 (Coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef)  Coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef has fallen by half since the 1980s.  21 July 2014 (Israeli attacks kill 100 in one day)  Israeli attacks killed 100 Palestinians in one day, many of them civilians.  This included shelling a hospital.  Israel's tactics guarantee lots of civilian casualties. One must question whether defense against attacks that might kill a few civilians justifies a response that kills hundreds of civilians.  21 July 2014 (Looting at jetliner crash site)  Ukrainian rebels have not protected the jetliner's crash site from looting or disturbance of evidence.  I regard this as proof of guilt.  Demonstrating the effectiveness of state manipulation of the media, most Russians believe the downing of the Malaysian jet was a plot against Russia.  This is comparable to the global heating denial campaign which has convinced so many Americans to support political fantasy.  21 July 2014 (India's censorship law)  India's censorship law is being used to persecute a critic of Modi.  21 July 2014 (Google abolishes "real name" requirement)  Google has abolished the "real name" requirement for Google account.  This might mean that Google+ is acceptable to use. But I am not certain, because I don't know the answer to two follow-on questions:   What other personal data must one supply to make an account, and do they amount to identification of the user? Is it possible to make a Google account named "Rumplestiltskin358", contacting the server through Tor, and not enable Google to identify you?  Does that require running nonfree Javascript code.  Later: Google+ is useless without nonfree Javascript code, so it should not be used.  21 July 2014 (The Internet of Things)  7 Reasons Why the Internet of Things Is Doomed.  Actually, some of them are reasons why we should kill it, which do not necessarily imply it is doomed on its own.  A "smart house" project Japan is a scheme to impose total surveillance and tracking.  This demonstrates the danger inherent in such schemes.  21 July 2014 (Tobacco ads targeted at minors)  RJ Reynolds has been hit with 23 billion dollars in punitive damages for advertising designed to make minors smoke.  The article says "children", but adolescents are not children, so I won't use that word. Advertising tobacco to adolescents is arguably even worse than advertising it to children, since children are not likely to start smoking whereas adolescents may well do so.  21 July 2014 (Pressure to allow GMO farming)  Even in Isolated, Pristine Tasmania, Pressure to Allow GMO Farming.  21 July 2014 (Airline ticket purchases)  The US keeps lots of information about everyone's airline ticket purchases and appears to keep it for at least 10 years.  21 July 2014 (Urgent: Support postal banking)  US citizens: Support postal banking.  21 July 2014 (The Rising Global Movement That Calls for #noTTIP)  The Rising Global Movement That Calls for #noTTIP.  21 July 2014 (Syria calls for UK to support Assad)  Syria says it is stupid to support the rebels and calls for the UK to support Assad.  The sad thing is, that is true. When the main Syrian rebel groups joined with the Islamists, they became enemies of human rights just as much as Assad is. Here's an article that argues that Israel and Saudi Arabia have promoted the violent rebellion in Syria, even as far as directly supporting jihadis.  I wonder if Israel supports ISIS too.  21 July 2014 (State legislators that support voter-ID laws)  State legislators that support voter-ID laws show a strong statistical tendency to discriminate against Latinos.  21 July 2014 (All The Big Broadband Players Support FCC's Proposed Rules)  All The Big Broadband Players Support FCC's Proposed Rules... Which Says All You Need To Know.  21 July 2014 (Urgent: Diplomacy with Iran)  US citizens: phone your senators and urge them not to block diplomacy with Iran.  21 July 2014 (Urgent: Support the Hide No Harm Act)  US citizens: tell Congress to support the Hide No Harm Act.  21 July 2014 (Some Israelis cheer at deadly bombardment)  Some Israelis go to hills near Gaza to cheer at the deadly bombardment. A journalist suspected of not sympathizing with them was threatened with violence.  21 July 2014 (Obey the US government)  US journalist Cokie Roberts bemoans the fact that everyone around the world does not obey the US government.  I think most governments fear the US too much; they let the US pressure them into unjust plutocratic treaties.  In the 90s, when I used to listen to National Public Radio, I loathed Roberts' right-wing criticisms of right-wing "Democrat" Bill Clinton. They showed me that NPR is actually rather right-wing, contrary to the reputation it gets by contrast with the extremely right-wing commercial US media such as Faux News.  21 July 2014 (Journalist Andy Hall faces the threat of imprisonment)  Journalist Andy Hall faces the threat of imprisonment for revealing slavery in Thailand.  Making it a crime to publish an accusation of abuses is prima facie injustice and inexcusable.  21 July 2014 (UK is saving emails of lots of people)  The UK is saving emails of lots of people, without warrants, in case it might be interested in them in the future.  The R.I.P. act (for Rip Internet Privacy) was an injustice even with its previous interpretation. The UK must repeal it.  20 July 2014 (San Francisco workers threatened)  An arrogant plutocrat threatens San Francisco workers with being replaced by an oppressive computer if they demand decent wages.  In the short term, the workers should simply repeat the demand, to show they are not scared.  In the medium term, they face the threat of being replaced by computers in any case, so they should organize to prohibit that. Why should stores be allowed to replace human sales clerks with computers? It should be banned by law. Until then, I make a point of refusing to use those machines, to push back against them.  In the long term, everyone should get a guaranteed income, obtained by taxing the owners of the robots. This should perhaps be conditioned on not having children; however, anyone who adopts a child should get a big subsidy.  20 July 2014 (Wildfire in state of Washington)  A wildfire in the state of Washington has burned 340 square miles.  20 July 2014 (Israeli soldiers in Gaza)  Israeli soldiers are in streets fighting in Gaza.  Thousands of civilians are trying to flee, but no place is safe.  20 July 2014 (Decriminalization of drug use)  WHO calls for an end to treating drug users as criminals.  20 July 2014 (Malaysian plane's black box in Russia)  A Russian radio station reports that rebels sent the Malaysian plane's black box to Russia.  The "investigation" by Russia cant be trusted, but this meddling confirms it was the rebels or Russia that shot down the plane.  The article also provides evidence that Russia is firing lots of short-range missiles at Ukraine. Unlike the ineffective missiles that Hamas fires at Israeli civilians, these are a real threat to Ukrainian troops.  20 July 2014 (Urgent: Let Mohyeldin go back to Gaza)  Everyone: Call on NBC News to let Ayman Mohyeldin go back to Gaza.  20 July 2014 (Russia's paid internet propaganda)  Russia has a paid internet propaganda and troll army.  The US has one too.  The US is funding research on how to manipulate people through social networks.  20 July 2014 (The fighting in Gaza)  Uri Avnery comments on the fighting in Gaza.  20 July 2014 (Children fleeing from Central America)  Why so many children flee from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador can be traced to what the US did to those countries.  20 July 2014 ("Counter-terrorist" tactics)  "Counter-terrorist" tactics can be effective against a small underground group, but not against an insurgency with popular support.  20 July 2014 (Israel firing flechette shells)  Israeli tanks are firing flechette shells that hit everyone in a large area 300 meters by 90 meters, and using them in towns where civilians are likely to be hit.  Gazans say Israel is using some sort of poison gas.  Doctors in Gaza suspect Israel is using experimental weapons that rip human bodies to shreds.  19 July 2014 (Urgent: Protect ocelot and jaguar habitat)  US citizens: call for protection of habitat for ocelot and jaguar.  19 July 2014 (Wildfires in northern Canada)  Even northern Canada is suffering from a rash of wildfires due to unusual heat.  These fires are due to global heating, and they fuel more global heating. This is positive feedback at work.  19 July 2014 (Urgent: Oppose drilling in Arctic Ocean)  US citizens: oppose oil drilling in Arctic waters.  19 July 2014 (Thousands to march in Detroit)  Thousands to March in Detroit as 'Heartless' Water Shut-Offs Continue.  19 July 2014 (Sliding into global heating)  NOAA summarizes the continuing slide into global heating.  19 July 2014 (Nuclear weapons and climate change)  A study forecasts that 100 small nuclear weapons would cause drastic global cooling and reduce rainfall for more than a decade, as well as damaging the ozone layer.  19 July 2014 (Interview with Edward Snowden)  An interview with Edward Snowden.  A transcript.  19 July 2014 (Urgent: Diplomacy with Iran)  US citizens: Call on the Senate not to interfere with diplomacy with Iran.  19 July 2014 (Urgent: Check pipelines for leaks)  Citizens of Massachusetts: Call on the state to check for methane leaks from pipelines.  19 July 2014 (Urgent: Cut the F-35 fighter plane)  US citizens: Tell Congress to cut the F-35 fighter plane.  19 July 2014 (ISIS declares Christians second-class)  ISIS declared Christians must be second-class citizens, expressing the tyrannical nature of Islam in pure form.  19 July 2014 (Workers' safety nets)  Why employers prefer that workers have no safety net.  19 July 2014 (Pebble Mine blocked)  The EPA blocked the Pebble Mine to protect salmon.  19 July 2014 (AIDS researchers on downed flight)  The number of leading AIDS researchers killed on the downed flight was much less than previously believed.  19 July 2014 (Independent DRM-free ebooks sell more)  Independent ebooks without DRM seem to sell more copies.  That's helpful for the cause of getting rid of DRM, but since DRM is an offence against readers' freedom, if it did increase sales that would not be an excuse for it.  19 July 2014 (NY thug kills man with chokehold)  New York thugs killed a man by putting him in a chokehold. They had no reason to attack him in the first place.  19 July 2014 (Gaza free-fire zones)  Israel plans to turn a third of the area of Gaza into a free-fire zone.  This plan represents a compromise with world opinion. Left to itself, Israel's government might prefer to declare the entirety of Gaza a free-fire "buffer zone". Or you might say that it has unofficially done so.  19 July 2014 (Campaign money from prison owner)  Florida Governor Scott is raising lots of money from a private prison owner.  19 July 2014 (Passenger jet shot down)  A passenger jet was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing everyone aboard. Around 100 leading AIDS researchers were on the plane.  A leaked tape reportedly shows pro-Russian rebels in the Ukraine shot down the jetliner, thinking they had attacked a military transport plane.  This sort of thing is what happens in war. US drone attacks are called "surgical strikes", but they often do the military equivalent of amputating the wrong leg. A US ship shot down an Iranian jetliner, also by mistake. Israeli bombs in Gaza are supposedly aimed at "terrorists" but many hit schools, hospitals, wells and homes.  However, when Russia handed high altitude SAMs to rebels without rigid checklists, it made this sort of accident rather likely.  A reporter resigned from Russia Today to protest its absurd claims that Ukraine fired the missile.  19 July 2014 (Obama approves injuring whales)  Obama approved the plan to injure 100,000 whales and dolphins to find more undersea oil that we can't ever dare extract.  19 July 2014 (Ethiopia to imprison dissidents)  Ethiopia plans to imprison some dissidents on bogus charges of "terrorism".  What the US and UK do, other countries imitate.  19 July 2014 (Niger activists face charges)  Niger activists opposed to a secret uranium mining deal with France face charges for holding a press conference.  19 July 2014 (DRIP surveillance law)  The Open Rights Group will challenge the new DRIP surveillance law in court.  19 July 2014 (Forcing EU to accept Tar Sands Oil)  US Accused of Forcing EU to Accept Tar Sands Oil.  19 July 2014 (School nutrition standards)  The Food Industry Lobby Groups Behind the New School Nutrition Standards.  19 July 2014 (Nurse's refusal to force feed)  What convinced the Guantanamo nurse that force feeding is wrong.  18 July 2014 (A camera in every bathroom)  Blanket digital surveillance is a start. But how about a camera in every bathroom?  18 July 2014 (UN has condemned massive surveillance)  The UN has condemned massive surveillance as a violation of human rights.  This includes data retention such as the UK is in the process of reimposing.  18 July 2014 (Urgent: Make Detroit turn the water back on)  US citizens: Tell Obama to make Detroit turn the water back on.  18 July 2014 (Urgent: Publish the composition of the fracking fluid)  US citizens: call for a requirement for fracking companies to publish the composition of the fracking fluid.  18 July 2014 (Israel's army has attacked Gaza)  Israel's army has attacked Gaza. This included bombardment of a hospital.  Israeli accusations that Hamas stores arms in civilian buildings were proved partly valid: the UNRWA found missiles in a disused school building.  Whether they store arms in civilian buildings that are actually in use is not proven.  18 July 2014 (The secret US prison at Bagram)  In the secret US prison at Bagram, the prisoners frequently have to go on hunger strike to get clean water to drink or to see the ICRC.  18 July 2014 (Your portable tracking and surveillance device)  Your portable tracking and surveillance device can now also inform about changes in your behavior pattern.  18 July 2014 (How America Fails the Rule-of-Law Test)  How America Fails the Rule-of-Law Test.  18 July 2014 (Urgent: Do not let Israel bomb the Wafa rehabilitation hospital)  Everyone: call on Obama not to let Israel bomb the Wafa rehabilitation hospital.  18 July 2014 (US allowed monopolies)  Since Reagan, the US has allowed monopolies or oligopolies to spread across the range of businesses, subjecting Americans to unchecked power of businesses.  This was done in the name of "free markets", but really it was "laissez faire". Due to the inherent instability of the free market, removal of the regulations that protected it allowed it to be converted into something more like feudalism.  18 July 2014 (Campaigning against TTIP)  Campaigning against TTIP, This Treaty Is Plutocratic, another instance of the oppression of the TPP.  18 July 2014 (Efficiencies in agriculture)  Efficiencies in agriculture could in principle feed billions more people. But the total meat production would have to go down pretty far.  Introducing efficiency into agriculture is much more easily said than done, and global heating will interfere greatly as it means that weather changes from year to year and the proper agricultural methods for a given area cannot be predicted.  17 July 2014 (NBC yanks Ayman Mohyeldin)  NBC yanked correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin out of Gaza because he did a good job of covering the main effect of Israeli bombing.  17 July 2014 (Censorship in Brazil)  Brazil allows people to censor all publication about them, and many biographies have been banned. A bill proposes to correct this.  17 July 2014 (Municipal broadband)  The House of Representatives passed a bill that would stop the FCC from making municipal broadband legal.  17 July 2014 (Syrian girls forced to marry)  Syrian mothers force their daughters to marry, as young as 13, fearing that they will otherwise be raped. One said she expected her male relatives to murder the daughter if she is raped.  Rape is common in war, but Arab culture converts rape into a sentence of death. What barbarism! Having daughters in such a society should be considered committing a crime against them.  17 July 2014 (RIAA shuts down radio archive)  The RIAA shut down a radio archive that has operated almost 20 years.  I hope people set it up again in some other country.  17 July 2014 (Censorship in France)  Censorship in France: a blogger has been fined for publishing a negative opinion of a restaurant.  17 July 2014 (Hamas and Islamic Jihad offer truce)  Reportedly Hamas and Islamic Jihad have offered a 10-year truce in exchange for Israel's ending the siege of Gaza and ending its isolation.  These terms seem reasonable to me. Most of the issues in dispute between Israel and Palestine are left out, which is appropriate since this proposes a truce rather than a full settlement.  17 July 2014 (Nurse refuses to force-feed prisoners)  A military nurse at Guantanamo has refused to participate in force-feeding on the grounds that it is inhumane.  I expect the Obama regime to repress this nurse.  17 July 2014 (Republicans guard Hobby Lobby)  Republicans blocked the bill to correct the Hobby Lobby decision.  17 July 2014 (Israel attacking wells and sewers)   Israel is attacking wells and sewage systems in Gaza.  17 July 2014 (Netanyahu rejects peace)  Netanyahu stated publicly that he will never permit a Palestinian state to function.  An Obama representative rebuked Israel for maintaining the occupation of Palestine and rejecting peace.  It's a small sign of the courage that could have a chance of making Israel agree to peace.  17 July 2014 (Supposed cease-fire with Hamas)  Hamas says that Egypt and Israel did not discuss the supposed cease-fire with Hamas before announcing it.  17 July 2014 (Left-wing terrorist captured)  One of the few left-wing terrorists in Greece was captured, but the right-wing terrorists of Golden Dawn are still rampant, and the boot of the banks is still on Greece's neck.  17 July 2014 (Solitary for having Facebook page)  A prisoner in New Mexico is threatened with 90 days in solitary confinement for having a Facebook page.  I think being a used of Facebook is punishment enough.  17 July 2014 (Australia repeals carbon tax)  Australia has repealed its carbon tax, cementing a plan that will kill tens or hundreds of millions of people.  17 July 2014 (Plans to imprison journalists)  Australia's right-wing government plans to imprison journalists for publishing what whistleblowers report about spying on the public.  These journalists are, of course, the ones who have the "sense of responsibility" that Abbott says journalists should have.  The prohibition is so sweeping that almost any reporting about a secret government action could be covered. For instance, when dissidents identify their lovers as undercover thugs, they could be imprisoned.  17 July 2014 (Peace demonstrators attacked)  Peace demonstrators in Tel Aviv were attacked by right-wing hate protesters.  16 July 2014 (US border patrol thugs brutalize people)  US border patrol thugs brutalize people at will for grudges, and they are spreading their power to a ever further from the borders.  Don't forget how they beat up Peter Watts, then prosecuted him for not obeying fast enough.  That thug should be in prison.  16 July 2014 (Immigrant activist Jose Antonio Vargas was arrested)  Immigrant activist journalist Jose Antonio Vargas was arrested when he tried to fly out of a US city near the border with Mexico,  Vargas came to the US from the Philippines as a child, and found out many years later that he did not have permission to reside in the US. I don't believe that countries are obliged to admit everyone that wants to move to them, but people who came as children &mdash; before they were responsible &mdash; and remained for many years should be allowed to stay.  16 July 2014 (The west's foreign aid to Africa)  The west's foreign aid to Africa is less than what the west takes out of Africa.  16 July 2014 (Overprotectiveness is stunting mental growth)  Overprotectiveness is stunting the mental growth of a generation children &mdash; in particular, denying them contact with nature.  The article refers to the UK but I have seen similar attitudes in the US.  16 July 2014 (Bill Clinton's deregulation of banks)  Too-big-to-fail banks exist because of Bill Clinton's deregulation of banks, and their incomprehensible maneuvers are also permitted due to his deregulation of banks.  Hillary Clinton is in the same camp; she works for the plutocrats.  16 July 2014 (Obama's right-wing nature)  Contrast with Elizabeth Warren helps Democrats see Obama's right-wing nature.  15 July 2014 (How World Bank, IMF and WTO combined to wreck countries' economies)  Joseph Stiglitz explains how the World Bank, IMF and WTO combined in the 90s to wreck countries' economies, impoverish most people, and transfer their wealth to the international elite.  Clearly this continues in recent times, as can be seen in austerity in Europe.  Ukraine is now on the menu.  RT has an obvious slant which comes from Putin, but Michael Hudson is a western economist who accepted this opportunity to communicate to the public.  15 July 2014 (US government aims to be omniscient and omnipotent)  The US government aims to be omniscient and omnipotent.  This makes its unquestioning supporters comparable to theocrats.  15 July 2014 (Urgent: Remove all US troops from Iraq)  US citizens: phone your congresscitter to support HCR 105 to remove all US troops from Iraq by the end of the year.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  15 July 2014 (US government has too few meat inspectors)  The US government has too few meat inspectors, as part of the cockeyed plan to let companies inspect themselves.  15 July 2014 (What the World Cup Can Teach Progressives About Corruption)  What the World Cup Can Teach Progressives About Corruption.  15 July 2014 (Israel accepted a ceasefire proposed by Egypt)  Israel accepted a ceasefire proposed by Egypt, but Hamas rejected it.  Both Hamas and Israel had reasons to want some inconclusive fighting in Gaza Apparently Israel has had enough fighting to achieve its aims, while Hamas has not.  15 July 2014 (US companies must hand over foreign data to US courts)  The Obama regime argues in court that US companies must hand over foreign data to US courts regardless of foreign laws.  15 July 2014 (UK's NHS is grudgingly rationing)  The UK's NHS is grudgingly rationing out hip replacement operations. I suppose this is because of the shortage of funds, by which the right wing want to make it so bad people will accept privatization.  15 July 2014 (Citigroup will have to pay 7 billion dollars)  Citigroup will have to pay 7 billion dollars for misleading investors, but it's not enough to discourage a repeat, and the executives responsible won't be punished.  15 July 2014 (Non-star writers are paid very little)  Non-star writers are paid very little by the existing copyright-based publishing system. In the UK, the median income for working authors is a pitiful 17,000 or 18,000 dollars a year.  The existing copyright-based system mainly supports the publishing companies as well as the stars that have clout with them.  15 July 2014 (Abstinence-based sex-non-education)  Abstinence-based sex-non-education is telling lies to keep virgins ill-informed; it puts them in danger.  Les Liaisons Dangereuses described the results of this in 1782, so there is no excuse for ignorance.  15 July 2014 (Florida's congressional districts)  Florida's Republicans drew congressional districts illegally to favor Republican candidates, but they hope it is too late to fix the problem for this year.  15 July 2014 (Ban on styrofoam food containers)  Washington DC has banned styrofoam containers for food and drinks.  As usual, plastic companies lobbied against this step forward. You would think that some stockholders would be wise enough to say, "People will always want plastic, and we can go along with selling it over a longer period of time to keep our rivers and seas clean." I suspect that the corporation structure systematically leads executives to be extremists: to demand to maximize their profits no matter what the cost to society.  Perhaps some reorganization of the structure of a corporation could alter that tendency. That would a great thing.  15 July 2014 (The Citibank payment)  The Citibank payment is peanuts compared to what it received in bailout funds.  15 July 2014 (Australian prison ship)  Australia is holding a boatful of asylum seekers in prison on a ship.  15 July 2014 (Artist arrested for distributing art)  A Japanese artist has been arrested for distributing art: a 3D printer model for a boat designed from her vagina. She has campaigned for years to end the taboo on the image and even the word for "vagina". I think sexual taboos, which censorship preserves, are the cause of many sexual obsessions and hatreds.  15 July 2014 (UK CO2 emission reduction targets)  The UK government still officially has carbon emission reduction targets, but has ensured it will not meet them.  15 July 2014 (Wild cheetahs being wiped out)  Wild cheetahs are being wiped out by taking the cubs for pets.  15 July 2014 (Armenian former soldier in Moscow)  An interview with an Armenian former soldier who volunteered in Moscow to go to fight for the pro-Russian side in Ukraine.  15 July 2014 ("Grass roots" support from Gates)  How Bill Gates's money was used to fund and organize "grass roots" support for the Common Core.  This makes me think of how Tea Party "grass roots" groups got funding from rich sponsors.  15 July 2014 (Secret trial in China)  Two westerners face a secret trial in China.  Think of this when the UK talks about secret trials.  15 July 2014 (Half of children in India stunted)  Around half the children in India are stunted, as if they did not get enough food, because of exposure to germs from human excrement.  15 July 2014 (Nuclear weapons and global heating)  Nuclear weapons relate to global heating in a number of ways.  15 July 2014 (Walmart's Food Stamp Scheme)  Walmart's Food Stamp Scheme.  15 July 2014 (South Africa on the verge of adopting a state secrecy bill)  South Africa is on the verge of adopting a state secrecy bill that would force journalists to name their sources, and imprison whistleblowers. Following the unjust lead of the US.  15 July 2014 (Soccer world cup)  The soccer world cup will leave Brazil saddled with a debt of perhaps 14 billion dollars.  The world cup of soccer should no longer be given a tax exemption.  I am not sure that change is sufficient to make the world cup cease to damage the host country. If you live in Canada, Mexico, Colombia, the US or Morocco, I urge you to campaign against your country's bid to hold the 2026 world cup.  15 July 2014 (What the US has lost since September 2001)  What the US has lost since September 2001.  15 July 2014 (Israeli bombing in Gaza)  Israeli bombing in Gaza has destroyed or damaged almost 1000 houses.  15 July 2014 (UK spy agencies have repeatedly bugged elected officials)  UK spy agencies have repeatedly bugged elected officials.  They also have a big catalog of tools for distorting and sabotaging public activity on the internet.  15 July 2014 (Three Israelis have been charged)  Three Israelis have been charged with kidnaping and killing an Arab teenager.  This is as it should be, but it is the exception. Israelis kill many Palestinians every year, and almost always have some sort of official cover that gives them impunity.  15 July 2014 (Unions correlate with high productivity)  In advanced countries, with the exception of the US, strong unions correlate with high productivity.  So don't believe the executives when they claim that unions destroy productivity.  15 July 2014 (Missouri plans to execute a man)  Missouri plans to execute a man convicted of murder disregarding evidence that he was probably innocent.  14 July 2014 (Hillary's Candid Motto)  Hillary's Candid Motto for Democratic Party: "Represent Banks".  14 July 2014 (Urgent: Reject "investor-state" provisions)  US citizens: tell the US Trade Representative to reject "investor-state" provisions in treaties.  14 July 2014 (UK accesses records of medical visits)  The UK accesses records of medical visits to find illegal immigrants.  14 July 2014 (Drones in use for private spying)  Drones are in use for private spying on behalf of idiotically jealous spouses.  On occasion, these uses achieve a positive result, but I don't think they should be permitted loosely.  14 July 2014 (Attack on synagogue in Paris)  Protesters from a march in Paris, condemning Israel's bombing of Gaza, tried to attack a synagogue.  The people in the synagogue are not the ones launching the attack. They may not even support it. The standard Israeli way of dismissing all criticism of its occupation policies is to call it "antisemitism". Apparently these protesters really are antisemitic, but their bad example will help Israel label all of us as "antisemitic".  There is a substantial amount of antisemitism in France among the right wing.  14 July 2014 (Frequency of "natural" disasters)  "Natural" disasters happen 5 times as often as they did in the 1970s, because now they are mainly artificial.  14 July 2014 ("No fly" list "state secrets")  Obama is trying to use the "state secrets" privilege to quash the case of a man who is suing to get off the "no fly" list.  The "no fly" list is punishment without trial, obviously unconstitutional, but we can't count on the pro-authoritarian US Supreme Court to care about this.  14 July 2014 (The right to die)  Jo Beecham is dying of cancer, but has gone to great lengths to prepare to commit suicide without help rather than be helplessly subject to a medical system that will refuse to let her escape short of death.  14 July 2014 (Blackmail by tobacco company)  British American Tobacco has tried to use its giant market power to blackmail a Ugandan MP who has sponsored a European-style bill to discourage smoking.  This sort of blackmail is common, and it is one reason we need to break up large companies. If BAT were replaced by 50 companies, and the biggest of them were 5% the size of BAT, they would not have this power.  14 July 2014 (Urgent: Clean Energy Victory Bonds)  US citizens: Support the bill to authorize Clean Energy Victory Bonds.  Raising taxes on the rich would be better than borrowing money, but either one is a lot better than failing to promote clean energy.  14 July 2014 (Urgent: Oppose whaling)  US citizens: call on the US government to firmly oppose whaling.  14 July 2014 (Market forces rule western democracies)  WikiLeaks has shown us that western democracies are now ruled by market forces that debase the very notion of freedom.  14 July 2014 (E-cigarettes)  Do e-cigarettes lead people away from smoking, or are they a new way to get teenagers hooked?  Perhaps they should be available only by prescription, to smokers who want to quit.  14 July 2014 (UK surveillance bill)  The UK's surveillance bill threatens to punish companies world-wide if they do not obey UK surveillance orders. And it requires some web sites to track their users.  14 July 2014 (Haiti's cardinal condemns voodoo)  Haiti's cardinal condemned Voodoo, saying that that religion distracts believers from real solutions to their problems.  Religion generally tends to do that, but I am skeptical of the claim that belief in Voodoo is what typically leads poor Haitians not to use the services of doctors or lawyers. I suspect that poverty is responsible for that, and they turn to Voodoo as an affordable substitute.  14 July 2014 (Islamists in Libya on offensive)  Islamists in Libya have gone on the offensive.  14 July 2014 (The world's global problems)  An analysis of the development of the world's global problems since 1945.  14 July 2014 (Software patent war)  The software patent war has extended to data centers.  14 July 2014 (Israel kills 50 more Palestinians)  Israel killed 50 more Palestinians in Gaza, including 22 from one family.  Both Israel and Hamas desire fighting in Gaza for political reasons, expecting the situation to be unchanged when the fighting stops (except for the casualties).  14 July 2014 (Hachette put itself at Amazon's mercy)  Hachette put itself at Amazon's mercy by insisting on Amazon DRM for ebooks.  14 July 2014 (The right-wing undermining of Britain's NHS)  The right-wing undermining of Britain's NHS is increasing the time it takes for ambulances to reach people.  The UK needs to increase taxes on the rich and on businesses so it can spend enough on the NHS.  14 July 2014 (The Iron Dome missile interceptor)  Ted Postol says that the Iron Dome missile interceptor nearly always fails to destroy the missile's warhead.  14 July 2014 (Republicans allowed poor person to speak about poverty)  Republicans finally allowed an actual poor person to speak about poverty but could not accept what she said.  14 July 2014 (Urgent: Children that arrive in the US alone)  US citizens: remind Obama that children that arrive in the US alone are often valid refugees.  14 July 2014 (Sentenced to prison for photographing protest)  Mary Anne Grady Flores has been sentenced to a year in prison for photographing a protest against drones at Hancock Air Base.  The US government concocts all sorts of excuses to quash dissent.  14 July 2014 (Workers punished for spending over 6 minutes a day in the toilet)  In the US, workers are punished for spending over 6 minutes a day in the toilet.  14 July 2014 (Big-Labor Strikes and Low-Wage Struggles Jockey for Future)  In UK, Big-Labor Strikes and Low-Wage Struggles Jockey for Future.  14 July 2014 (Reagan's destruction of US antitrust)  Reagan's destruction of US antitrust law paved the way for consolidation in every industry, which transfers wealth to the new monopolies from everyone else.  14 July 2014 (The state can order a suspect to decrypt files on his computer)  In a dangerous decision, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that the state can order a suspect to decrypt files on his computer.  14 July 2014 (California highway thug beat up a homeless woman)  A California highway thug beat up a homeless woman who was walking by the side of a highway, but was recorded on video by a passing citizen.  It is true we don't know what they said to each other. So ask yourself, can you imagine anything she might possibly have said that would give a thug a valid reason to beat her up? The thug may be asking himself the same question.  If you want to view the video, you can access it without free software by running the youtube-dl script with http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-J-yVKxXrY as argument.  Warning: viewing that video on Youtube in the usual way entails running either Flash Player or nonfree Javascript code.  14 July 2014 (Tepco continues building the "ice wall")  Tepco continues building the "ice wall" to keep ground water away from the ruined Fukushima nuclear plants, despite various problems.  What I don't understand is why they want to use this untried method, rather than building a pair of solid concrete walls with a replaceable plastic filler between them.  13 July 2014 (Spying via an iThing feature)  China is concerned about spying via an iThing feature that finds locations that a person often goes to.  14 July 2014 (Tor)  Why you should use Tor.  13 July 2014 (UK role in US torture flights)  The UK government is looking closely at some documents about its participation in US torture flights.  13 July 2014 (Russia's new Internet law)  Russia has adopted a law requiring web sites that Russians use to keep data about Russians in Russia.  This will make their data safe from spying by the US, but easily available for spying by Russia.  If this law applied only to only to stores and such, it might be a net improvement for Russians. However, blocking Russians from communicating through a foreign web site is oppressive.  An ethical communications system does not insist that people give their real names or their real locations. Such a system may not know if you're in Russia.  13 July 2014 (Desmond Tutu on the right to die)  Desmond Tutu spoke up for the right to assistance in dying.  The bill being discussed is a step forward, but inadequate, because it is limited to people who probably will suffer for no more than 6 more months even without help. People condemned to decades of boring helplessness should also have this right.  13 July 2014 (Marshall Islands vulnerable)  From the Marshall Islands: Why the next climate treaty is vital for my country to survive.  13 July 2014 (Contraceptive implant)  A future contraceptive implant could last for 16 years.  I don't see a tremendous benefit in being able to turn it on and off without removing it &mdash; how often would you want to do that? I expect most women will want to use contraception until they decide to have children, have some, then use contraception for the rest of their fertility (or get sterilized). The easy way to space their children would be with shorter-term contraception, perhaps one-year implants. This way, the long-term implant would only have to be removed once, which it requires anyway.  What worries me is that they might design it to require nonfree software to communicate with it.  13 July 2014 (Tax-dodging in Luxembourg)  Luxembourg is Europe's biggest tax-dodger enabler, and Juncker, the new head of the European Commission, worked hard to make it so.  As president, he will have the power to sabotage the commission's investigation into what he set up.  13 July 2014 (Americans using less gasoline)  Americans are using less gasoline, so the US government wants to fund highways from sources other than the gasoline tax.  It is good that we are driving less, and good that cars are more efficient. We should raise the gasoline tax rate to give Americans even more incentive to drive less and use more efficient cars. And we can mostly stop building new highways (though the old ones need proper maintenance).  13 July 2014 (NY Times continues boosting wars)  The New York Times continues boosting wars, despite claiming it has learned its lesson from the disastrous results of boosting Dubya's conquest of Iraq.  13 July 2014 (Urgent: Respect for freedom of press)  US citizens: Tell Obama, respect freedom of the press: don't jail James Risen.  13 July 2014 (Urgent: Oppose CISA)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to oppose CISA, the new and nastier version of CISPA.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  13 July 2014 (US thugs given impunity)  The US Supreme Court has made and approved a long string of decisions allowing thugs to do almost anything with impunity.  This includes the ruling that the president can have anyone imprisoned without trial by calling that person a "terrorist suspect".  The recent decision that they can't search arrested people's phones and computers without a warrant is an exception, but one exception isn't enough.  Since "drug-sniffing" dogs are mentioned, I should point out that a dog can easily learn to react the same way to a cue from its handler as it does to the smell of drugs. Then it can give the handler an excuse to search whoever the handler wants to search.  13 July 2014 (Honduran minors fleeing to US)  The biggest origin of minors trying to enter the US without visas is Honduras; they are driven by the effects of the US-supported coup.  13 July 2014 (Israeli drone attack)  An Israeli drone attack targeted a building which was a residence for disabled people. Some were killed.  The family home of an enemy fighter is not a valid military target either. A large fraction of Israelis are military reservists; does that make their family homes legitimate targets for missiles?  13 July 2014 (NSA records 80% of all phone calls)  William Binney says the NSA records at least 80% of all phone calls, and lies about it.  13 July 2014 (Geoengineering schemes)  One weakness in most geoengineering schemes intended to counter greenhouse heating is that their effect is temporary so it is necessary to keep doing them forever. If any other catastrophe occurs, making society unable to continue the geoengineering, catastrophic heating (much faster than today) would start within a few years.  Most of these geoengineering schemes fail to do anything to stop ocean acidification, so there would still be a catastrophe anyway.  13 July 2014 (US fossil fuel subsidies)  The US continues billions of dollars of subsidies to fossil fuels.  13 July 2014 (Organic fruit and vegetables)  A large meta-study found that organic fruit and vegetables tend to have more antioxidants and less pesticides and cadmium.  Metastudies are tricky, and if this tendency is real, it is not certain whether it translates into a health benefit. But it plausibly could.  13 July 2014 (Tax-dodging UK rock stars)  In the UK, tax dodging has been simplified so that even working class heroes that get famous can do it.  13 July 2014 (Obama regime's claims contradicted)  The Obama regime stated that it had not known that the UK was going to make The Guardian destroy the computer that a copy of the Snowden leaks, but in fact the highest US spymasters were informed.  12 July 2014 (Israeli hate for Arabs)  Uri Avnery: Israelis for the most part hate Arabs so much that they hardly feel any disgust towards the people among them who kidnaped and burned an Arab teenager.  I suspect that a secondary purpose of the bombing of Gaza is to distract attention from that crime with a bigger crime.  Here's a report from Gaza.  If Palestinians are situating military activities in homes with civilians, that is just as reprehensible as Israel's attacks on those homes. But they can't be launching missiles from homes, and Israel doesn't really need to attack anything except missile launchers.  Indeed, Israel hardly even needs to attack missile launchers. It could slap the missiles away, as it does, and not bother to retaliate, saying, "Are you tired of acting out? Done with your tantrum?" Israel's forbearance would make Hamas look like fools.  But that would not satisfy crowds that shout, "Death to Arabs." And it might create a situation where peace seems reasonable, which is the last thing Netanyahu wants.  12 July 2014 (Stripping names from data ineffective)  The idea of stripping people's names from their data from their histories and passing that around turns out not to work: it is too easy to figure out who they were.  All the more reason why digital systems must not collect people's histories.  12 July 2014 (Sex education)  A Republican candidate that advocates "abstinence only" as a substitute for sex education ended up with a pregnant teenage daughter.  What do you call people who teach their children "abstinence only"?Grandparents.  12 July 2014 (Deforestation and Ebola)  Deforestation by humans may be responsible for Ebola outbreaks in humans.  12 July 2014 (US media excuses Israeli violence)  US television showed a bombed-out Gaza family and said they were Israeli.  It is part of a standard pattern of greatly exaggerating Palestinian violence and excusing the much larger Israeli violence.  12 July 2014 (Detroit water shutoffs)  Citizens of Detroit blocked water shutoff trucks, and were injured by the thugs that arrested them.  I hope the next protest will involve thousands of Detroiters.  12 July 2014 (ACLU suing to put an end to investigating people for non-reasons)  The ACLU is suing to put an end to investigating people for non-reasons.  An FBI Counterterrorism Agent Tracked Me Down Because I Took a Picture of This.  12 July 2014 (Christie gave state subsidy for political agreement)  Chris Christie gave a state subsidy to a company run by a Democrat as part of an agreement not to oppose each other.  A proposed New Jersey law to ban political donations from companies that get state subsidies is just a part of what is needed to end political cronyism, a.k.a. plutocracy.  12 July 2014 (Clinton and Kerry want Snowden to submit to a trial)  Clinton and Kerry want Snowden to submit to a trial that imitates the mockery of justice in Alice in Wonderland.  12 July 2014 (Freedom of speech covers billionaires' money)  Senators that say freedom of speech covers billionaires' money also want to amend the Constitution to ban flag-burning.  12 July 2014 (Divesting from fossil fuel)  The World Council of Churches calls for divesting from fossil fuel.  12 July 2014 (Caliph of ISIS may have been radicalized in US prison)  The Caliph of ISIS may have been radicalized in a US prison in Iraq.  One can say this serves the US right, but Iraqis do not deserve the oppression of ISIS.  12 July 2014 (Parts of Miami Beach are regularly inundated)  Due to global heating, parts of Miami Beach are regularly inundated.  The Turkey Point nuclear plant will become an island, and will be vulnerable to a Fukushima-type disaster.  As the sea advances, millions of people will have to leave Florida, perhaps in a few decades. The Florida Keys may be submerged during this century.  I suspect that Florida land interests are behind Florida politicians' denial. Fools continue to buy buildings that are likely to be drowned, while somebody else extracts profits to move out of Florida before everyone else wakes up to it.  In 50 years, when the price collapses, will those fools' heirs sue Senator Rubio's heirs?  12 July 2014 (US gov't refuses to repudiate torture)  The US government refuses to repudiate torture, and continues to practice it, and US mass media treat it as admirable.  12 July 2014 (Nanomaterials)  Nanomaterials: a new range of substances that might be put in food, and some of them might have toxic effects.  A given chemical in the form of nanoparticles might have different effects from the same chemical in a different form. It could even depend on the size of the nanoparticles being used. I suppose most chemicals that are ordinarily nontoxic will not be toxic in nano form either, but there will be exceptions to stumble upon.  12 July 2014 (Climate saboteurs shifting from denial of global heating)  Climate saboteurs are shifting from denial of global heating to minimizing the expected consequences.  It's a delaying campaign to keep the money flowing unabated to fossil fuel companies as long as possible.  12 July 2014 (Gay-friendly materials likely to be censored)  Where censorship of sex is permitted, gay-friendly materials are likely to be censored &mdash; not just in Singapore, but in Canada too.  12 July 2014 (Greenpeace parody was taken down from YouTube)  A Greenpeace parody attacking the Shell/LEGO marketing partnership was taken down from YouTube by a vague copyright claim.  Using the DMCA for political censorship is not unusual. It could be considered common practice.  12 July 2014 (Kurds have dropped out of the Iraqi government)  The Kurds have dropped out of the Iraqi government.  This seems to be a push to make Maliki quit. However, since the Kurdish region aims for independence, perhaps Iraq could kick its representatives out of Parliament; then maybe it could form a government.  12 July 2014 (How UK is involved in US kidnapping for torture)  How the UK is involved in US kidnapping for torture, and how it blocks public inquiry into this complicity.  12 July 2014 (Urgent: Stop the ruining of antibiotics)  US citizens: call on the FDA to stop the ruining of antibiotics by feeding them to farm animals en masse.  12 July 2014 (New Pun)  New pun judge in space  12 July 2014 (Urgent: Fix the Hobby Lobby decision)  US citizens: Support the Senate bill to fix the Hobby Lobby decision.  12 July 2014 (Nando's Chicken tax-dodging)  The complicated tax-dodging scheme of Nando's Chicken.  12 July 2014 (US spending on F-35 fighter)  The US is spending a trillion dollars on the F-35 fighter whether it works or not.  12 July 2014 (Afghan presidential election)  Karzai approved a UN plan to check the ballots of the Afghan presidential election.  I hope that this makes it possible to find the real winner before the candidates start trying to defeat each other militarily.  12 July 2014 (Judge attacked for questioning taboo)  An Australian judge faces irrational attacks after saying that sex between siblings might not be inherently bad.  He seems to be talking about sex done willingly. Why should willing sibling sex be associated with "abuse"?  Alas, Judge Neilson is partly mistaken: some apparently still have a taboo about this, and they attack him for questioning the taboo. The attacks are blatant non sequiturs, claiming that sibling sex is bad because it's "disgusting" and because it's illegal.  12 July 2014 (Hoax on Australian bank)  Environmental defender Jonathan Moylan faces sentencing for posting a Yes Men-style hoax announcement that a bank had pulled out of a coal mine project.  If you are in Australia, you might want to move your money out of ANZ bank permanently as a protest against its destructive investments.  12 July 2014 (Sugar in "sports drinks")  "Sports drinks" have a considerable amount of sugar, and unless you're doing hard exercise for a long time, you're better off drinking water.  12 July 2014 (Pesticides and autism)  Some studies suggest certain farm pesticides increase the chance of autism; a pregnant woman who lives near a fields where they are used has a higher chance of an autistic child.  11 July 2014 (Terrible new cybersecurity bill)  Congress is about to vote on a terrible new cybersecurity bill which gives the NSA more spying authority.  Here's more detail.  11 July 2014 (Afghan civilian casualties)  Civilian casualties in Afghanistan are rising as the Taliban increasingly fight in towns.  Afghans don't get as angry when the Taliban kill civilians as they do when US soldiers or drones kill civilians.  11 July 2014 (Children facing deportation)  Children facing deportation need lawyers.  11 July 2014 (Fine for poisoning water supplies)  The fine for poisoning water supplies for 300,000 people: just 11,000 dollars.  11 July 2014 (Religious freedom in Guantanamo)  Obama's lawyers argue that prisoners in Guantanamo don't deserve the same religious freedom as a corporation.  11 July 2014 (UK public workers strike)  A one-day general strike of public workers shut down a lot of the UK, in response to a proposed law intended to make it hard for unions to strike.  Part of the motive for privatization of government services is to weaken unions, which helps drive workers' pay down and facilitates cheating them.  11 July 2014 (Teenager accused of "child pornography")  The Virginia thugs have given up on making child pornography of a teenager threatened with imprisonment for sending a picture of his penis to his lover.  The laws against "child pornography" are unjust, and this is one of many reasons.  11 July 2014 (The people killed by bombing Gaza)  Half the people killed by bombing Gaza are women and children. A good fraction of the men killed are probably noncombatants too.  The EU has deplored the bombing, while the US tries to shield Israel.  11 July 2014 (Encouragement for whistleblowers)  Big signs in Washington DC encourage whistleblowers to talk to exposefacts.org.  I asked an expert, who says that the site is good to use but reminds people to use https to communicate with it.  11 July 2014 (FBI treated Nelson Mandela as threat)  The FBI treated Nelson Mandela as some sort of Communist threat after he was released from prison.  11 July 2014 (Helsinki plans an integrated system of public transit)  Helsinki plans an integrated system of public transit that would make it obsolete to have a car.  This would be a tremendous advance, except that they plan to build in total surveillance as part of the fine print. Every portable phone is a tracking device, and if you have to pay through one, that means identifying yourself to the system. That would be a big step backwards for privacy.  If we don't want to live in a world of total surveillance, we must reject and oppose every new system that collects data about all users. We must insist on designing systems so that they do not track or identify people. Helsinki's transit system should provides ways to call for a ride by calling a number, and allow paying cash.  See http://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html for more explanation, and practical recommendations.  11 July 2014 (FISA court is a rubber stamp for spying on people)  I did not sign a petition to make the FISA court stop profiling based on religion and a couple of other personal classifications because I think the real problem is that the FISA court is a rubber stamp for spying on people.  11 July 2014 (Thai editor jailed for a Facebook posting)  A Thai editor was jailed for a Facebook posting.  11 July 2014 (UK plants to rush new surveillance requirements)  The UK plans to rush new surveillance requirements into effect without debate.  11 July 2014 (New UK nuclear plant at the cost of a tremendous subsidy)  The UK plans to build a new nuclear plant at the cost of a tremendous subsidy, including buying the power for decades at an artificially high price.  I think the "compelling power" that won parties' support for this deal probably emanates from someone's money, but that gives me no clue about how.  11 July 2014 (Turkey ordered to pay compensation to two journalists)  The European Court of Human Rights ordered Turkey to pay compensation to two journalists that were imprisoned for a year with no grounds. However, they are on trial for publishing information about a supposed coup plot.  11 July 2014 (Don't be shocked that the US spied on American Muslims)  "Don't be shocked that the US spied on American Muslims. Get angry that it justifies spying on whomever it wants."  11 July 2014 (UK documents about its cooperation with CIA kidnapings)  UK documents about its cooperation with CIA kidnapings were destroyed by "water damage".  They could be telling the truth. Maybe they flushed these papers down the toilet &mdash; that would certainly lead to "water damage".  11 July 2014 (Urgent: Penalize US contractors with a history of cheating)  US citizens: Call on Congress to penalize US contractors with a history of cheating workers out of their pay.  Of course, there should not be so many contractors' employees &mdash; their numbers have been swollen due to privatization. Most of that privatization was perverse. We should reverse perverse privatization, moving the work back to civil service workers.  11 July 2014 (Jury put blame on thugs for shooting innocent woman)  A jury put blame on the thugs for shooting an innocent woman in London who then died of her injuries, 29 years ago.  The real question is, what will be done to keep the thugs accountable today so that they do not continue such practices?  11 July 2014 (Hong Kong's press freedom)  Hong Kong's press freedom has got worse over the past year.  10 July 2014 (Urgent: Boost Massachusetts minimum wage)  Citizens of Massachusetts: sign this petition to boost the Massachusetts minimum wage to $15.  10 July 2014 (Urgent: Oppose punishing Rev. Senyonjo)  Everyone: Call on Uganda not to punish Rev. Senyonjo for refusing to preach hatred of gays.  10 July 2014 (China tax exception for electric cars)  China has given a big tax exemption to electric, hybrid and fuel cell cars.  10 July 2014 (Israel's bombardment of Gaza)  Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed over 70 people. Targets included family homes (8 dead) and a cafe where people were watching soccer on TV (6 dead).  Israel has a recipe for killing Palestinian civilians with a built-in excuse: claiming it was aiming at military targets, and that it was "retaliating" for rockets.  The rockets, when aimed at civilian towns such as Sderot, are a war crime too, or more often an attempted war crime, since these rockets almost never hit anyone. But Israel intentionally started this battle, so it cannot plead "retaliation" now.  Hamas may have cynical motives for giving in to the provocation.  Natural gas under the sea is part of what the fight is about.  I don't think any amount of Israeli attack will make the people of Gaza reject Hamas. Its effect will be to make them cling to it more tightly.  10 July 2014 (Iraqi women organize secretly)  Iraqi women organize secretly to protect women from oppression from religious bullies, including ISIS.  10 July 2014 (US radio transmissions to Cuba)  The US stopped operating a plane that beamed radio transmissions to Cuba, which were nearly always jammed.  The programs contain a mixture of US government propaganda plus facts correcting Cuban government propaganda. That the Cuban government jams these transmissions indicates its own injustice.  10 July 2014 (Republican sabotage of gov't)  Arsonists Posing as Firemen: How GOP Sabotages Government for Fun and Profit. This article explains how Republicans' sabotage brought about several problems which they now attack Democrats for.  10 July 2014 (How oil companies handle opposition)  How oil companies try to steamroll local governments that oppose their projects.  10 July 2014 (Germany catches another spy)  Germany has caught another spy that first worked for the CIA, then tried to contact Russia.  10 July 2014 (Neonicotinoids and birds)  A study links neonicotinoids to falling populations of birds.  10 July 2014 (Surveillance of Muslim leaders)  Broad Coalition Urges 'Full Public Accounting' for Government Surveillance of U.S. Muslim Leaders.  10 July 2014 (US gov't subsidies for fossil fuels)  The US government and states gave fossil fuels 37 billion dollars of subsidy last year, and this has increased 45% since 2009.  Without this, renewable power would grow more.  10 July 2014 (Assault by LA thugs at protest)  I Filmed the LAPD Assaulting Me at Pro-Israel Demonstration.  10 July 2014 (Growing inequality)  The OECD predicts economic growth will almost cease by 2060, but inequality will keep increasing.  That's before counting the losses that global heating will cause; the report treats that as uncertain.  The report presumes that we will keep increasing productivity by automating more work. But I don't think this increased productivity is good at the cost of more unemployed poor people -- not if the benefits go to the rich. It would be better to limit the automation and keep more people employed.  We do not have to allow inequality to increase. The growing inequality is due to policies that can be changed.  10 July 2014 (Keeping global heating down)  The Earth Institute shows how we can still keep global heating down to a painful 2 degrees C, if we act firmly now.  The report offers specific targets and plans for the 15 most-emitting countries.  The report assumes substantial use of nuclear power, but I am sure the target can be met without that at the cost of some extra money.  10 July 2014 (Obama's secretive administration)  38 Journalism Groups Urge President to Stop Excessive Controls on Public Information.  Obama's administration seems to be the most secretive ever.  10 July 2014 (Targets of FBI and NSA spying)  Meet the Muslim-American Leaders the FBI and NSA Have Been Spying On.  The NSA does this without breaking the law, because the law is putty in its hands.  10 July 2014 ("Cybersecurity" bill)  Feinstein's senate committee adopted a "cybersecurity" bill that allows increased state surveillance.  10 July 2014 (Shortages in South Sudan)  The cease-fire in South Sudan is allowing the beginning of recovery but there is a shortage of food, medicine and doctors.  10 July 2014 (Israeli gov't censorship and lies)  The Israeli government had information showing that the three kidnaped teenagers were dead, but used censorship and lies to make the public believe they were being held as hostages by Hamas, and manipulate public feeling so as to attack Hamas.  10 July 2014 (Urgent: Oppose surveillance legislation)  Citizens of the UK: phone your MPs to oppose surveillance legislation being rushed through Parliament so fast there will be no time for it to be thought about.  https://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaigns/no-emergency-stop-the-data-retention-stitch-up  10 July 2014 (One of the Koch brothers was a Bircher)  One of the Koch brothers was a Bircher in the 60s and put money into fighting against civil rights.  10 July 2014 (Urgent: Stop supporting Monsanto)  US citizens: call on Hillary Clinton to stop supporting Monsanto.  10 July 2014 (Urgent: Suspend use of neonicotinoid pesticides)  US citizens: Tell the EPA to suspend use of neonicotinoid pesticides. There's plenty of evidence tying them to colony collapse of bees, and since they accumulate, it will take time for them to decrease in the environment.  10 July 2014 (Israeli troops confiscated computers)  Israeli troops confiscated the computers of Palestinian cultural magazines.  10 July 2014 (Social demand for collective mourning)  On the social demand for collective mourning for people one did not know.  I rejected the collective mourning for those who died in the September 2001 attacks; while Americans were supposed to feel angry and afraid, I focused instead on resisting the coming attack on our freedom.  10 July 2014 (Former speaker asks for nonviolent Palestinian movement)  The former speaker of the Israeli Parliament asks for a nonviolent Palestinian movement to pressure Israel into accepting peace.  10 July 2014 (Australia's Asylum Secrecy)  [Australia's] Asylum Secrecy on the High Seas Is Designed to Foil the Enemy Within &mdash; The Law.  A minister sees no sign of torture in Sri Lanka. In effect, he says he saw many Tamils who are not in prison or being tortured.  Some imprisoned asylum seekers have attempted suicide hoping to improve their children's chances of receiving asylum.  This suggests that those are economic migrants, aiming to get their children into Australia rather than fleeing persecution.  09 July 2014 (ALEC typo copied to new bill)  State legislators acting as tools for ALEC copied the error from ALEC's model bill.  The bill would be just as bad if they had been more careful, but this shows they are tools of ALEC, and not even very competent ones.  09 July 2014 (The Arab Peace Initiative)  The Arab Peace Initiative proposed a peace plan which still offers a direction for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  09 July 2014 (Palestinian nonviolent resistance)  Palestinians are still organizing nonviolent resistance, but they need the rest of the world to notice it.  09 July 2014 (Snowden detractors concede)  Those who refuse to recognize Snowden as a hero, and attack him for showing secrets to the press, are now compelled to admit that the NSA can't be trusted to keep its data about you and me private.  Of course, Snowden did not give this data to just any reporters. He chose reporters who would take care against harming the people mentioned in those data.  09 July 2014 (Depletion of Ogallala Aquifer)  The Ogallala Aquifer, which underlies parts of 8 US states, is being depleted rapidlyThe spreading drought (which will get worse due to global heating) is speeding this up.  09 July 2014 (Insider stock trading)  Congresscritters are resisting an investigation by the SEC of accusations of insider stock trading.  09 July 2014 (What TPP stands for)  Doctors: TPP Would Trample Access to Medicines.  TPP stands for Treaty for Plutocratic Power.  09 July 2014 (Israel's response to murdered civilians)  The extent of Israel's collective punishment response to three murdered civilians amounts to a far bigger wrong to Palestinian civilians.  09 July 2014 (Chinese writer asks thugs to arrest him)  Chinese writer Murong Xuecun asked the Chinese thugs to arrest him as they had arrested his friends.  09 July 2014 (Afghan presidential election)  The Afghan presidential election preliminary results declared Ashraf Ghani the winner, but Abdullah Abdullah accuses Ghani's campaign of ballot-stuffing and says he will set up a parallel cabinet.  I have no way to judge what the truth is, but running an election properly includes preventing opportunities for ballot stuffing.  09 July 2014 (Another excuse to invade Gaza)  Israel has created an opportunity to invade Gaza again. This gives it a chance to kill or wound hundreds of Palestinians, with an excuse to shield the killers from prosecution.  This is retaliation for rockets launched from Gaza, generally not by Hamas. These rockets are quite warlike but almost never hurt anyone. Effectively they are like a raised fist, which Israel generally responds to with attacks that kill plenty of civilians.  This cycle of violence started with the murder of three Israeli teenagers, to which Israel responded by arresting hundreds of Palestinians unrelated to the murder (generally without charges), and sending troops into Arab areas to harass large numbers of people. This predictably inspires young Palestinians to throw stones, which is an opportunity to shoot tear gas, which often injures people, and also an opportunity to shoot bystanders dead. It's even possible for a soldier to kill Palestinians with rubber-coated steel bullets or tear-gas canisters.  Israeli civilians living in colonies ("settlements") in Palestine are launching attacks against nearby Palestinian villages.  Here's Juan Cole's analysis.  09 July 2014 (Urgent: Network neutrality)  US citizens: Call on the FCC to choose complete network neutrality.  09 July 2014 (Urgent: Regulate recycling plants)  US citizens: call on the EPA to regulate pollution from recycling plants.  09 July 2014 (US agents seize son of Russian MP)  US agents seized Roman Seleznev, son of a Russian MP, in the Maldives.  Either the US agents kidnaped him without informing the government of the Maldives, or the government of the Maldives handed someone over to the US illegally without an extradition hearing.  Whether Seleznev is guilty of breaking computer security (please don't call it hacking!) is a different question. I know nothing about it; maybe he is, or maybe he isn't. But that seems like a secondary issue compared to the way he was grabbed.  09 July 2014 (Birds breeding earlier)  Arctic heating: a study of several bird species found they are breeding 4 to 7 days earlier than a decade ago.  09 July 2014 (TSA rule for powering up computers)  An ex-TSA agent ridicules the rule requiring powering up every computer. He says it is not likely to stop terrorists, but is sure to cause many people great upset. I suspect that one passenger a week will explode in violent rage at the confiscation of a computer that happened to be empty of power. The sadists will have a great excuse to imprison these people and really ruin their lives, and say they are doing it to protect us.  09 July 2014 (Clinton's Surveillance State baggage)  Hillary Clinton Flaunts Her Surveillance State Baggage.  09 July 2014 (UK cruelty to the weak)  The UK has secret quotas for kicking disabled people off benefits.  Cruelty to the weak is what it stands for.  09 July 2014 (Obama proposes Chalabi for Iraq)  It seems Obama is reaching for the bottom of the barrel to propose corrupt schnook Ahmad Chalabi to govern Iraq, or at least pretend to.  09 July 2014 (ISIS no excuse for mass surveillance)  A former chief British spy says that ISIS is not interested in attacking the West, and that publicly calling it a threat is self-defeating.  ISIS is a threat to human rights in the Middle East, and that makes it very bad. But we should not let governments make this an excuse for universal surveillance.  09 July 2014 (Urgent: Boycott Eden Foods)  Everyone: boycott Eden Foods for attacking access to birth control.  09 July 2014 (Millions of US veterans suffer from physical and psychological problems)  Millions of US veterans suffer from physical and psychological problems, and many commit suicide.  Being in a war that you can't justify to yourself requires a special sort of nihilism.  09 July 2014 (China cancelled American Tibetologist's visa)  China cancelled American Tibetologist Elliot Sperling's visa, apparently because he spoke up for the imprisoned Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti.  09 July 2014 (Mapping states from "tight" to "loose")  Mapping US states on a spectrum from "tight" (repressive) to "loose" (tolerant).  09 July 2014 (63 of the women kidnaped by Boko Haram escaped and walked to freedom)  63 of the women kidnaped by Boko Haram escaped and walked to freedom.  The article explains how politics has hampered the fight against Boko Haram.  09 July 2014 (Most aid agencies do little to help real refugees)  M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res reports that most humanitarian aid agencies have adopted bad priorities and do little to help real refugees.  09 July 2014 (Canada is holding negotiations about the TPP in a secret location)  Canada is holding negotiations about the TPP in a secret location. The government is evidently scared of the people's disapproval of its plan to betray democracy.  09 July 2014 (Legalizing marijuana has reduced violent crime in Colorado)  Legalizing marijuana has reduced violent crime in Colorado as well as creating jobs and increasing tax revenue.  Most importantly, it means an end to a system of prohibition that ruins many lives and spreads corruption.  Alas, we still have the "war" on other drugs. Some of those drugs are really addictive and/or harmful, but prohibition does even more harm.  09 July 2014 (CIA employee framed and then forced to resign)  CIA employee Jeffrey Scudder tried to go through channels to have old articles published &mdash; which was in fact his job. His reward was to be framed and then forced to resign.  Here's more information.  This is the route various authoritarian politicians (including Hillary Clinton) think Snowden should have taken.  09 July 2014 (President of Indonesia)  A former general associated with a massacre in East Timor, who has stated his opposition to democracy, may be elected president of Indonesia.  08 July 2014 (Greenhouse gas emissions and economy)  A study finds that the UK's policies intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have not decreased the total economy.  It could be that this is because the policies are not strong enough to avert disaster. However, disaster is not in any country's real economic interest.  08 July 2014 (Antibiotics)  Governments must act to assure development of new antibiotics.  Of course, they must also act to end the wasteful ruination of antibiotics once discovered, but they have not had the courage to tell meat producers to jump in the lake.  08 July 2014 (Urgent: Regulate pollution from refineries)  US citizens: call on the EPA to regulate pollution from refineries.  08 July 2014 (Global heating denial industry grasps at thin straws)  The global heating denial industry grasps at thin straws of sea ice to hide the overwhelming fact of heating.  08 July 2014 (Comparing ending of fossil fuel use with freeing slaves)  Comparing the ending of fossil fuel use with freeing the slaves in the US.  The similarity is not complete. Enslaving one person is an injustice, whereas burning one gallon of gasoline would hurt nobody if that were the only gallon burnt. But there are similarities.  08 July 2014 (States That Raised Their Minimum Wages)  US States That Raised Their Minimum Wages Are Experiencing Faster Job Growth.  08 July 2014 (The privatization of soldiers and intelligence agents)  The privatization of soldiers and intelligence agents creates armies of lobbies to increase the spending on them.  08 July 2014 (UK thugs attacked aged and/or disabled people)  Tony Nuttall describes how UK thugs violently attacked aged and/or disabled people who rode a train without paying to protest the plans to end the travel discount for old people and disabled people.  If the UK government were not so stingy with its support for old people and the disabled perhaps it would not be important to give them a discount on trains. Anyway, the conduct of the thugs is disgusting regardless of whether one agrees with the protesters.  08 July 2014 (Australia admitted handing over boat people from Sri Lanka )  Australia has admitted handing over boat people from Sri Lanka to the Sri Lankan navy.  Sri Lanka will hand them over to the thugs, and they may be prosecuted for departing Sri Lanka without permission.  Australia's high court ordered the state not to hand over another boatload.  08 July 2014 (World Bank considering relaxing standards for loans)  The World Bank is considering relaxing standards for loans to large projects that can involve fossil fuels or other dangers to the public.  08 July 2014 (Nader asks Americans to support two progressive candidates)  Ralph Nader asks Americans to support two progressive candidates for US Congress, one independent and one Green.  08 July 2014 (Capitalism is having a recovery for the rich)  Capitalism is having a recovery for the rich, but making this benefit the non-rich requires changing the system.  08 July 2014 (Hospitals buying personal data to warn people they might get sick)  Some US hospitals are buying personal data to warn people they might get sick.  I see no harm in this particular practice. If it seems creepy, that's because it is the consequence of something that really is creepy: the collection of all that data about people. That's what's really wrong.  I would not mind if my own computer kept a log of my purchases. I might find it useful to run a free program to look through them for things to warn me about. I don't want a data broker to have that data, which is why I always buy anonymously, paying cash.  07 July 2014 (TORorists)  Leaks show that NSA calls all Tor users "extremists" and makes them targets for spying.  Reading some Boing Boing articles is also enough to make a person a target.  I don't know whether reading THAT Boing Boing article would make you a target. Just to be careful, you should access it through Tor.  If it is true that a second NSA whistleblower has followed Snowden's path, I wonder if he was inspired by reading my emails. My emails say,  [[[ To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please consider &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]]] [[[ whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]]] [[[ foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example. ]]]   There is a t-shirt you can use to declare yourself a TORrorist.  If you have blocked nonfree JavaScript code, you will not be able to pay through Stripe. Please don't enable JavaScript; please pay with Bitcoin or some other method.  07 July 2014 (Facebook's conduct)  Nobody should have expected Facebook's conduct to be ethical.  07 July 2014 (US TV networks bullied by Exxon)  Exxon bullied the major US TV networks into refusing to present a paid political advertisement that criticizes Exxon.  All I can say is, Yexx!  If you want to watch the PSA, which is hosted on YouTube, please do not access the site directly! Use youtube-dl.  07 July 2014 (Hobby Lobby contraception coverage)  The owners of Hobby Lobby provided medical care including contraception coverage, voluntarily, until a group of right-wing Christians suggested this was a way to the secularity of the law.  Now Hobby Lobby demands to ban insurance from paying for doctor visits in which patients even discuss contraception. And the Supreme Court may have given it to them.  The battle over contraception is the central battle of the war for women's equality and emancipation.  07 July 2014 (HP CEO continues to cut jobs)  US TV lionizes the CEO of Hewlett Packard for continuing to cut jobs despite the "economic recovery" in the US (thus helping insure it's not a real recovery for the American people).  One incidental detail, irrelevant to the issue, is that this CEO is a woman. It's irrelevant to the issue because a male CEO could have done the same, and it would be equally wrong. The wrong here has nothing to do with her gender. It was right of FAIR not to mention that.  I mention it, though it is irrelevant to this issue, because there are feminists who campaign to have more female CEOs. I think they are being distracted by an irrelevancy.  With regard to CEOs, what matters most for working women isn't whether their chance of becoming one of those CEOs is one in a million or one in ten million. It is curbing the CEOs' power to harm them. Never mind how women CEOs get paid; focus on how women workers get paid.  07 July 2014 (New excuses for mass surveillance)  The UK government has come up with two new excuses to maintain surveillance of everyone.  What they amount to is, "If we can't watch everyone all the time, somewhat more crimes will happen." That's true. But if we allow the state to prevent crimes at any cost, it will oppress us. A state that the people do not control is a bigger danger than the crimes it fails to prevent.  The state itself commits frequent violence when it shows contempt for the people.  06 July 2014 (Sea-level rise hitting Virginia)  Sea-level rise is hitting Virginia so hard that even Republicans can't deny it.  It's not wholly due to global heating. The US east coast is slowly sinking, and this adds locally to the worldwide rise of the ocean caused by global heating.  06 July 2014 (Clinton praises Merkel)  Hillary Clinton praised Angela Merkel, Germany's right-wing leader who refused to relax the austerity that has crushed Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. This shows where Clinton's sympathies lie.  06 July 2014 (Electronic privacy proposal)  Massachusetts Legislature Advances Key Electronic Privacy Proposal.  06 July 2014 (Ethiopian land grab campaign)  An Ethiopian farmer says UK aid to Ethiopia funds the land grab campaign that chases thousands off their land and forces them into artificial villages where they can't get food.  This land grab is probably for the benefit of some global company.  06 July 2014 (Snowden gave journalists a sample of intercepts)  Snowden gave journalists a sample of intercepts. The Washington Post says that 1/9 of them were from real targets and 8/9 were from bystanders.  They show that the NSA lied again.  Here's the original story.  06 July 2014 (Suing the US for approving coal mines)  WildEarth Guardians are suing the US for approving coal mines without taking account of the pollution the mines and the coal will cause. The US government says the US can't afford to interfere with all that coal mining.  In the long term the US can't afford to let the mining continue, but the US government is more concerned with the short term interests of mining companies than the long term interests of the whole country.  06 July 2014 (Tariq Abu Khdeir says Israeli thugs attacked him out of the blue)  Tariq Abu Khdeir says that Israeli thugs attacked him out of the blue, and video shows them beating him while he was motionless.  Thugs around the world do this to the people they hate. In Israel, the thugs hate Arabs.  06 July 2014 (Freedom of religion is mostly obsolete)  Freedom of religion is mostly obsolete, because most of it is included in freedom of speech and thought.  I am not convinced it is 100% obsolete, because religion includes some practices of worship that people should also have the right to do, within reason (as long as they don't violate others' rights). For instance, the Religious Freedom Restauration Act was adopted so that people wouldn't get fired for their (lawful) religious practices. That's not included in freedom of speech and thought.  However, if the US banned firing people over things irrelevant to their jobs, this aspect of religious freedom would also be superseded.  06 July 2014 (Urgent: Join the People's Climate Mobilization)  Everyone: join the People's Climate Mobilization  06 July 2014 (Australians protested the dooH niboR budget)  Australians protested the dooH niboR budget proposed by the Australian Cruelty Party.  06 July 2014 (Mothers make their daughters prostitutes in Cambodia)  In Cambodia, patriarchy and poverty push mothers to make their daughters prostitutes.  The way income, when it arrives, melts away on various necessities of relatives (on whom one depends for aid in turn) is typical of life for poor people in the US, too. This makes getting out of poverty much harder that the non-poor suppose it is.  06 July 2014 (Israeli thugs arrested then beat up a Palestinian teenager)  Israeli thugs arrested then beat up a Palestinian teenager, who is a US citizen and a cousin of the teenager who was burnt to death.  The US government has criticized Israel for this.  Meanwhile, Israel has arrested suspects in the murder of his cousin.  It is unusual for Israeli civilians to kill a Palestinian, just as it is unusual for Palestinians to kill Israelis. In fact, lots of Palestinians are killed by Israelis, but usually the killers have impunity because they are soldiers or thugs.  06 July 2014 (Urgent: Override Hobby Lobby)  US citizens: call on Obama to make an executive order to override the effects of the Hobby Lobby decision.  06 July 2014 (California in extreme drought)  80% of California is now in "extreme" drought, but Californians should get used to this as global heating will lead to more and worse droughts.  06 July 2014 (Business whistleblowers)  The Supreme Court ruled in favor of protecting some businesses whistleblowers from retaliation, but not completely.  06 July 2014 (Spy arrested in Germany)  Germany has arrested someone who was spying for the US.  06 July 2014 (Ikea supported dictatorships)  Ikea supported dictatorships in the Soviet Empire in the 80s.  I think that this is comparable to buying cotton from Uzbekistan today.  06 July 2014 (Clinton evades issue re Snowden)  Clinton continues calling for Snowden to submit to a US trial while evading the issue that he won't be allowed to argue that his actions served his country.  05 July 2014 (Facebook's emotion experiment)  A new ethical issue about Facebook's experiment: Facebook gave researchers data about its useds without getting the useds' consent.  05 July 2014 (Reversing privatization)  The growing movement to reverse privatization of public services.  05 July 2014 (Public pressure against neonicotinoids)  Public pressure forced Syngenta to retract its request for "emergency" permission for massive use of neonicotinoids in the UK despite the EU's moratorium on their use.  05 July 2014 (Toxic herbicide for new GMOs)  If the EPA approves toxic 2,4-D as a herbicide for new GMOs, over 5000 schools in the US will be rather close to the spraying.  05 July 2014 (Conversation with Glenn Greenwald)  Orwell's Dystopian Future Is Almost Here: A Conversation With Glenn Greenwald.  05 July 2014 (Romanian massive surveillance)  Romania is rushing a massive surveillance law to require all communications to be registered.  05 July 2014 (Nuclear Nightmares)  Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late.  05 July 2014 (Kidnaped Arab teenager burnt alive)  The Arab teenager kidnaped in Jerusalem was apparently burnt alive.  Arabs on buses and streets are facing harassment that gets to the point of violence, though other Israelis sometimes try to protect them.  05 July 2014 (Dark dust melting ice)  Dark dust, from fires, deserts and machines, is melting ice around the world, even in the Himalayas.  05 July 2014 (The right to die)  Religious Activists Have Too Much Say Over Our Right to Die.  05 July 2014 (America's national parks changing)  America's national parks are already being changed by global heating.  In a century, they may still be parks (if there is still a state that can maintain them as parks), but aside from bare rock they will change beyond recognition.  05 July 2014 (New Jersey gun control bill vetoed)  Chris Christie vetoed a New Jersey bill to limit magazines to just 10 bullets.  05 July 2014 (Facebook dissident ideas study)  One of the researchers in the Facebook emotion experiment has been funded by the US government to study the spread of dissident ideas.  05 July 2014 (Denmark plans car tracking system)  Denmark plans to impose a nationwide system to track cars.  Such systems should only see cars that are being specifically sought, or are not properly licenses.  05 July 2014 (FDA proposes labels for added sugar)  The FDA has proposed to require food labels to state the amount of added sugar. The food companies are lobbying against.  05 July 2014 (Obama's head of the SEC)  Obama's head of the SEC has turned out rather susceptible to the wishes of the companies it is supposed to regulate.  05 July 2014 (Hong Kong arrests leaders of protest)  Hong Kong arrested the leaders of the large democracy protest.  05 July 2014 (UK ISP censorship)  A way to find out whether a web site is blocked by ISP censorship imposed by the UK government.  04 July 2014 (Chernobyl meltdowns)  Although some nuclear power advocates claim that the Chernobyl meltdowns did not directly hurt the public, some groups that were nearby show high levels of certain diseases.  04 July 2014 (Ethiopian "terrorist" faces execution)  An Ethiopian "terrorist" (i.e., opposition party leader) faces execution after being extradited by Yemen.  The UK does not want to protest about such threats to air travellers making connections because it intends to endanger them similarly on  similar excuses.  04 July 2014 (Urgent: Conflicts of interest)  Everyone: call on Temple University to tighten its standards for disclosure of researchers' conflicts of interest.  Two professors there did a study which purported to find that private prisons are great improvements in efficiency; it turns out they were funded by private prison companies, and the study is biased.  04 July 2014 (In India there are thousands of temple prostitutes)  In India today there are thousands of temple prostitutes, given to the temple as children by their families. For the most part, they are treated with the same contempt that other prostitutes receive. (I don't understand why many men feel that sort of contempt for prostitutes.)  04 July 2014 (Corporations using nondisclosure agreements to gag whistleblowers)  US corporations are using nondisclosure agreements to gag whistleblowers.  04 July 2014 (US Military Presence in Somalia)  US Confirms Years-Long "Secret" Military Presence in Somalia.  04 July 2014 (UK gov't curbing better heat insulation in homes)  The UK government's policies are curbing the installation of better heat insulation in homes.  This will help the government's patrons meet their targets for sales of fossil fuels.  04 July 2014 ("cloud"y thinking)  More evidence that you shouldn't rely on "cloud"y thinking about where to store or transmit data: SoundCloud says it will profile users, and has given the music factories direct censorship control.  Don't use big web sites to distribute files &mdash; to the public or to specific people.  04 July 2014 (Urgent: Regulate oil and gas drilling on US public land)  US citizens: tell the Fish and Wildlife Service to regulate oil and gas drilling on US public land.  04 July 2014 (Urgent: Call on CNBC to apologize)  Everyone: Call on CNBC to apologize for seeking to publish a denial of global heating.  04 July 2014 (Australia has stopped refugee boats from arriving)  The Heatless Party's government in Australia has stopped refugee boats from arriving, at the cost of contempt for refugees, the UN, the press, the Supreme Court, the Australian public and the truth.  04 July 2014 (Supreme Court Rules JCPenney Allowed to Sacrifice Employees )  Supreme Court Rules JCPenney Allowed to Sacrifice Employees to Appease Cthulhu. (I think this is a satire.)  04 July 2014 (French Puns)  New pun in french.  03 July 2014 (Urgent: People before business)  US citizens: call on Obama to drop the Trade in Services Agreement and other treaties that put businesses ahead of people.  03 July 2014 (More threats to Great Barrier Reef)  A crazy proposal to transfer massive quantities of coal from ship to ship in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef.  Pollution is certain to spread, but hey, if you're going to burn that coal the reef is doomed anyway.  03 July 2014 (Great Barrier Reef speed limits)  Calling for speed limits for ships near the Great Barrier Reef to protect whales from being killed by collisions.  03 July 2014 (Abbott on suggestions of violence)  In Australia, only right-wingers are allowed to suggest using physical violence on those they disagree with.  Abbott surely deserves to spend many years in prison for his treatment of Australian poor, foreign refugees, and all future life on Earth. But not death, because the death penalty is never justified.  03 July 2014 (UK thugs refuse to investigate thugs)  The UK thugs have refused to investigate how thugs cooperated with others (journalists, etc.) to spy illegally on individuals.  03 July 2014 (Private business and medicine)  An argument for eliminating private business from the development and manufacture of medicines.  I am not sure we need to go that far. I advocate eliminating private business from the testing and approval of medicines.  03 July 2014 (The Conservative Mind)  Freedom, Power, and the Conservative Mind.  03 July 2014 (Culture War against Children)  The One-Sided Culture War against Children. Whether US parents are too lax, or too controlling, the "solution" is always "impose standardized tests to fire teachers."  I find that US parents tend to be too lax on some issues (they can't say "Don't be used by Facebook!" or "Don't sign an EULA that says you are not allowed to give that to someone else!"), and twistedly strict on others (kids never get to be home alone; parents think that would kill them). But the "solution" of "impose standardized tests to fire teachers" is never going to help.  04 July 2014 (Peruvian interior minister accused of ordering killing)  One of the Peruvian soldiers convicted of killing journalist Hugo Bustios says that Peru's current interior minister Urresti ordered the killing.  04 July 2014 (Australia sends back asylum seekers)  Australia gives some asylum seekers a cursory screening and sends them back.  It does not matter a priori whether this is done on land or on a ship, but doing so on ship facilitates "accidental" errors which, at a systematic level, are not accidents.  While the government refuses to admit this, it effectively admits it by trying to pretend that Sri Lanka does not torture dissidents.  Australia's plans show that its goal is to keep refugees out no matter what the situation.  04 July 2014 (Health problems due to fracking)  Pennsylvania told state health officials not to return phone calls from people who had health problems due to fracking.  04 July 2014 (Pakistani Taliban and polio)  Attacking the Pakistani Taliban provides an opportunity to attack the disease they protect: polio.  04 July 2014 (Carbon offsets are fueling land grabs in Africa)  Carbon offsets are fueling land grabs in Africa.  04 July 2014 (Thugs in Kashmir given impunity)  Indian soldiers and thugs in Kashmir have been officially given impunity for torture, rape and murder. The mothers of the disappeared have organized in response.  04 July 2014 (Nigerian Atheist receives death threats)  Nigerian Atheist Bala has been released from the mental hospital thanks to a strike by doctors, but now receives death threats from fanatical Muslims.  Islamic law is incompatible with human rights. I've posted examples from Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, Saudi Arabiaand Sudan. I am sure there are more. Most "Muslim" countries forbid religious freedom to anyone who was once considered a Muslim.  Nigeria must insist that human rights apply to the whole of the country and that no local system is allowed to pre-empt them.  04 July 2014 (Improvised explosive devices)  Improvised explosive devices killed 53,000 people in 2011-2013, most of them civilians.  I don't see much hope of stopping this practice as long as the groups that set these bombs are tolerated by their communities.  03 July 2014 (Urgent: Boycott Hobby Lobby)  Everyone: pledge to boycott Hobby Lobby.  03 July 2014 (Urgent: Ban on drones in national parks)  US citizens: call for continuation of the "temporary" ban on drones in national parks.  03 July 2014 (Prosecution of Benghazi suspect)  Ahmed Abu Khatallah's lawyers say the US government has given them no information about the evidence against their client.  03 July 2014 (7 Palestinians killed by Israelis)  A little information about the 7 Palestinians killed recently by Israelis. 4 of them teenagers.  Killing people who are not hurting anyone is wrong no matter who they are. However, Western politicians seem to care only when Israelis are the victims.  03 July 2014 (Privacy and Civil Liberties Overboard)  The "Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board" turns out to be the Privacy and Civil Liberties Overboard.  03 July 2014 (Undercover UK thugs)  A court ruled that UK thugs must answer when women ask in court whether their lovers were undercover thugs.  03 July 2014 (Spain punishes striking workers)  Spain is punishing striking workers.  03 July 2014 (New FCC rule for TV political ads)  A new FCC rule will require US TV stations to show who pays for political advertisements.  It is a good rule, but we still need this default rule: Vote for whoever is criticized by the expensive attack ads! (Unless you have time for careful study of the accusations against ALL the candidates.)  03 July 2014 (Debate about Capitalism)  A debate about whether Capitalism inevitably produces great inequality or merely tends to do so.  I think that the great inequality is not inevitable, but avoiding it takes firmness that requires true democracy (government policies chosen by the people in general to keep the rich in check). Once the rich replace democracy with plutocracy, it is a sure thing that the policies necessary to prevent tremendous inequality won't be practiced.  03 July 2014 (Yasuni oil)  Ecuador drew up a plan in 2010 to build a power plant in Yasuni to support oil drilling there.  It is not certain that the plan to leave Yasuni oil untouched was dishonest. This could have been a contingency plan for what to do if the world failed (as indeed it did) to contribute the money Ecuador requested for leaving that oil untouched.  In any case, Correa deserves credit for trying something that no other world leader has even tried. If other countries had provided the reasonable sum he requested, he would surely have gone ahead with the deal.  03 July 2014 (Water supplies in Iraq and Syria)  Dwindling water supplies are crucial to the military outcome in Iraq and Syria. Control of a dam means use of the water in its lake, use of the electricity it generates, and the chance to use the water to drown people downstream.  A multi-year drought caused the protests against Assad.  Global heating will eventually make it impossible for the current population of Iraq to survive there.  Our actions that cause global heating are a wrong that we must stop. Iraq contributes to these actions by extracting oil for us to burn. Iraqis also contribute to the problem by having more children than the region can support. One way of reducing population growth is to give women more control over their reproduction. ISIS will clearly do the opposite of that, but so do the religious Shi'ite groups.  Perhaps the world will need to adopt the principle that climate refugees must get sterilized as a condition for asylum. Not as a punishment (they are not personally to blame), but as a sustainability measure.  03 July 2014 (ISPs from various countries have sued GCHQ)  ISPs from various countries have sued GCHQ for attacking their computers.  03 July 2014 (Diplomat accused of attempted rape)  Malaysia refuses to let a diplomat accused of attempted rape use diplomatic immunity as a shield.  03 July 2014 (Tony B'liar plans to help al-Sisi)  Tony B'liar plans to help al-Sisi gain more business opportunities for Egypt.  Since Egyptians won't be allowed to think about politics or freedom, or enjoy satire on TV, I guess business is all they will be left with.  03 July 2014 (Palestinian teenager kidnapped and killed)  A Palestinian teenager was, it appears, kidnapped and killed as an act of explicit revenge for the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers.  The killers of those three teenagers probably thought that was revenge, too. Israelis kill lots of Palestinians each year, including teenagers and protesters. They also torture Palestinian teenagers.  These killings are wrong on both sides, and I insist on condemning them the same.  03 July 2014 (The permanent stress caused by poverty)  The permanent stress caused by poverty causes children's brains to develop improperly. With almost 1/4 of US children living in poverty, this creates a permanent handicap for the US, as well as an irremediable injustice to those children.  03 July 2014 (Chomsky: America's Real Foreign Policy)  Chomsky: America's Real Foreign Policy: Global Corporatization by Force.  03 July 2014 (We are sucking the oceans dry of small fish)  We are sucking the oceans dry of small fish to feed fish farms, but farmed fish can grow on vegetable food too.  It will take laws to stop the overexploitation of the oceans. We will have to defeat the business forces that want to wipe them out. Perhaps we should ban the sale of farmed fish that are fed animal products.  03 July 2014 (Caribbean coral reefs will be lost within 20 years)  Caribbean coral reefs will be lost within 20 years. Pollution and overfishing will get them before the CO2 does it.  02 July 2014 (Chilean officials charged with murder)  Two Chilean officials have charged with murdering two Americans in Chile, with the help of the then head of the US military mission.  This was done shortly after the US-organized September 11 attacks.  02 July 2014 (Poor families in the UK in sheds)  Poor families in the UK can't afford to rent more than a shed to live in.  It could be worse: they could be homeless as in the US.  The UK has enough rooms of housing, but policies encourage the rich to use up a lot of space, pushing purchase and rental prices up and leaving the poor with too little.  02 July 2014 (Global heating helps locusts)  Global heating doesn't hurt everything. It helps locusts, for instance.  02 July 2014 (Detroit citizens' right to water)  Detroit Citizens Vow Direct Action to Protect Their Right to Water.  02 July 2014 (Effect of CO2 on damselfish)  Increasing CO2 levels make damselfish unable to recognize other fish that they know.  02 July 2014 (Iraq's parliament gives up)  Iraq's parliament has given up on forming a government, without even trying.  Partition of Iraq may be the way to avoid unending civil war. (I advocated this a decade ago.) However, avoiding unending war also requires that the Sunni regions be ruled by people that are not fanatics.  02 July 2014 (French ban on wearing masks)  The European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of the French law that bans wearing masks.  This law is typically thought of in connection with a tiny minority of Muslim women, but that is a side issue. Wearing a mask is the only way to protect yourself from being tracked by face recognition cameras. If such cameras are not banned, masks must be allowed as a defense.  02 July 2014 (March for democracy in Hong Kong)  Hundreds of thousands of citizens of Hong Kong marched for democracy despite rain and heat.  02 July 2014 (Accusations of sheltering Taliban)  Afghanistan has accused Pakistan for years of sheltering the Afghan Taliban. Now that Pakistan is attacking the Pakistani Taliban, it accuses Afghanistan of allowing them bases there.  02 July 2014 (Soldiers shooting children)  No US soldier starts out wanting to shoot children, not even once, but the dynamics of occupation lead to making that standard practice.  02 July 2014 (Foreign banks reporting US citizens' holdings)  The US is making foreign banks in many countries report US citizens' holdings.  02 July 2014 (World Cup Protests)   Protests stimulated by the World Cup show that Brazil's democracy is under long-term threat.  02 July 2014 (Urgent: Stop sale of unsustainable fish)  In the US: call on Kroger Supermarket to stop selling unsustainable fish.  02 July 2014 (Nanomaterials for animal growth)  The FDA is looking for nanomaterials to make animals grow faster.  In principle, this is a great idea. In practice, things may go wrong.  Animals will eat these materials in large quantities, then excrete them; what will happen then? Sewage treatment and water treatment plants were not designed with them in mind, so whether they get into our water will be a matter of luck. If they do, will they increase human obesity?  02 July 2014 (Egyptian satirist to terminate show)  Egypt's most popular satirist said he will terminate his TV show, implying that the regime will not allow him to continue it.  02 July 2014 (Denial of access to contraception)  The US Supreme Court found an excuse to deny some American women access to contraception.  This decision makes no sense in its own terms, because the whole point of a corporation is that it is a separate entity from its owners. They can have religious beliefs, but the corporation cannot. These particular owners, in aiming to impose their views over employees' rights, want to have it both ways. "When the corporation pays for medical coverage, it's really us. If the corporation loses money, it's not us."  This case is part of a general campaign to eliminate access to birth control on the part of Christian fanatics that resemble the Taliban in their misogyny and intolerance.  This question has a real effect because the most reliable forms of birth control involve a big expense once in a while. Getting insurance coverage for them makes a real difference for many US women, especially now that the same right-wingers have made more of them poor.  Congress could amend the Religious Freedom Restauration Act to fix this decision, but it would be better to amend the Constitution to state that human rights in general do not apply to corporations.  However, the clean solution to this problem (and many others) is to disconnect medical care totally from employment. Making employers pay for medical care for employees has the side effect of encouraging companies to eliminate full-time US jobs in favor of foreign operations, part-time subcontractors, or robots.  Instead we should make wealthy people and businesses pay for health care for everyone, employed or not, through a progressive income tax.  02 July 2014 (Bogus "science" in US schools)  Some US states are still trying to teach bogus "science" instead of evolution.  02 July 2014 (Sledgehammer to the Climate System)  Former NASA Chief Scientist: "We're Effectively Taking a Sledgehammer to the Climate System".  02 July 2014 (Effect of car exhaust on moths)  Car exhaust makes it hard for certain moths to find flowers.  02 July 2014 (Court blocks coal mine expansion)  [US] Court Blocks Coal Mine Expansion For Not Counting The Costs Of Carbon Pollution.  02 July 2014 (Jellyfish becoming more prevalent)  It's not clear why jellyfish are becoming more prevalent in the ocean, but they are. Sometimes catastrophically so.  I'm sure some aspect of human activities is responsible. We are changing ocean ecosystems in so many ways that it would be a bizarre coincidence if none of them contributed.  02 July 2014 (Investigator threatened by Blackwater)  Blackwater quashed a US investigation by threatening to kill the investigator.  The US created this situation by sending mercenaries to Iraq and failing to impose accountability on them. For instance, they got away with rape.  The US ought to extend to mercenaries the full spectrum of laws that apply to soldiers. Better yet, it should stop using mercenaries at all.  02 July 2014 (US CEO pay)  Mysteriously, US CEOs are paid much more than CEOs in other countries.  It would be interesting to find out what difference enables CEO pay to balloon more in the US than in Japan and Switzerland. I suppose that CEOs play one company off against another, but they would do that everywhere if they can. Why is it they can do so more in the US?  02 July 2014 (No Impunity for Abu Ghraib Torturers)  Federal Court: No Impunity for Abu Ghraib Torturers.  02 July 2014 (Pitchforks coming for plutocrats)  A plutocrat writes: The Pitchforks Are Coming&hellip; For Us Plutocrats.  Plutocracy kills poor people by the thousands, maybe even by the hundreds of thousands. Through global heating, that will become millions, then tens of millions. They are justified in fighting for their lives. The longer this battle is delayed, the more destructive it will be.  On the other hand, if we build up the anger and the movement fast enough, maybe we can restore democracy without violence, and end the killing.  02 July 2014 (Pakistan to fight Islamists)  Pakistan seems to be serious about fighting the Islamists of North Waziristan.  02 July 2014 (The Japanese constitution)  The US has pressured the Japanese government into "reinterpreting" its constitution to permit fighting war on behalf of allies.  02 July 2014 (Global heating, fires and heatwaves)  The Australian government rewrote advice about fires and heat waves to cover up their relationship to global heating.  02 July 2014 (Many Americans despise the poor)  Many Americans despise poor people, not realizing that they too are very likely to be poor some day.  Poor people don't deserve contempt for asking for help. We must give poor people what they need in order to have a decent life. All children deserve good food, a good education, and everything else children should have.  However, poor people have a responsibility, too, as well as rights: they must not act so as to increase their needs. Specifically, they should not have children. Reproduction is a desire, not a necessity. For most people, of all the things they do, reproduction is what puts the biggest ecological burden on the world.  02 July 2014 (36,000 Egyptians have been arrested for protests)  36,000 Egyptians have been arrested for protests since the coup against Morsi.  02 July 2014 (Deforestation in Indonesia is booming)  Deforestation in Indonesia is booming, even faster than in Brazil.  02 July 2014 ("Casino Saturation")  Atlantic City casinos are closing as the region hits "casino saturation".  Gambling does not increase wealth, it only redistributes wealth. Atlantic City casinos were touted as a way to redistribute wealth from other states to New Jersey. However, that's not the sort of redistribution than the US needs.  The US needs to redistribute wealth from the rich to the rest. Unfortunately, casinos redistribute wealth from the middle class and the not-totally-broke working class, and a substantial fraction goes to the casino owners. It's a false solution, offered to reduce demand for a real solution.  02 July 2014 (Tax exemptions for environmental protection organizations)  Australia's government wants to eliminate tax exemptions for environmental protection organizations and forbid them to carry out boycotts.  It is understandable that the Australian government is concerned about donations to charities that help the poor and the sick, since it proposes a budget that would make poor and sick Australians dependent on those charities.  However, in the long term, protecting the environment is crucial for everyone's well-being.  02 July 2014 (US and European forests)  Global heating is going to cause a revolution in US and European forests.  02 July 2014 (Urgent: Help tackle the ebola virus outbreak)  US citizens: call on the WHO to help tackle the ebola virus outbreak without delay.  02 July 2014 (Israeli teenagers killed and buried)  The three missing Israeli teenagers were killed and buried.  There is no indication of who killed them, but Netanyahu is using their deaths as an excuse to attack people all over the West Bank and Gaza.  Israel's reprisals have killed 6 Palestinians so far, and imprisoned 400 people. Israel has not bothered to charge them with any crime, and clearly has no evidence to relate them to the three murders. Clearly most of them were not involved.  Is Israel no better than Egypt? Al-Sisi at least has courts "convict" those he wishes to kill or imprison. The "trials" are not serious, but that provides an opportunity to pressure Egypt to do better. Israel does not even bother with trials.  02 July 2014 (ISIS has proclaimed a caliphate)  ISIS has proclaimed a caliphate.  While directly this means nothing, it may convince lots of young foolish Muslims to support ISIS.  The biggest advantage of ISIS thus far seems to be that it is more cruel, bloody and unscrupulous than its rivals. I fear that this monstrous ideology will kill millions before it is stamped out. If you are a Muslim and you don't want your community destroyed by violent fanatics, you had better organize now to keep them out.  02 July 2014 (Industry without pollution control)  The Chinese government has been compelled by events to recognize that industry without pollution control has poisoned lakes and soils with heavy metals that cause cancer.  Nonetheless, people who campaigned to stop this are still treated as enemies of the state.  02 July 2014 (Facebook experiment)  Facebook experimented with putting happier or sadder material into its useds' feeds, and found that had a tiny but measurable effect on their emotions.  I don't see an ethical problem in the experiment as such. It seems to me little different from trying different text on your web site's front page, except that they wrote a scientific paper about it.  However, Facebook's power to influence people does seem dangerous.  Here are many reasons not to be a used of Facebook.  02 July 2014 (Emperor penguins threatened with extinction)  Emperor penguins are threatened with eventual extinction due to global heating.  01 July 2014 (Urgent: Effects of sugar consumption)  US citizens: call on the Surgeon General to report on the health effects of sugar consumption.  01 July 2014 (How US senators and reps voted)  Americans: see how your senators and representatives voted on holding corporations responsible for their actions.  01 July 2014 (Teacher pension cuts)  California's teachers' unions are failing to fight back against pension cuts imposed by Democrats, but Chicago's teachers organized public support, struck, and won.  01 July 2014 (FISA court extremely permissive)  The FISA court's standards for NSA surveillance are extremely permissive.  We also know that the NSA has deceived the FISA court.  01 July 2014 (Threat to the Great Barrier Reef)  Dredging a coal port near the Great Barrier Reef could cause even more damage than previously thought, because currents can cause the millions of tons of debris to spread.  01 July 2014 (Secret handover of Tamil refugees)  Australia has secretly handed over a boat full of Tamil refugees to Sri Lanka's navy, which is sure to torture them.  The Australian government cannot shield itself from condemnation by refusing to admit its actions. That can prevent us from getting proof, but we don't need that standard of proof to condemn a state for evildoing. The state's refusal to say what happened is enough basis to declare it guilty.  It is different when a human being is prosecuted. For instance, when the minister is put on trial for his role in this, he will be entitled to be considered innocent unless proved guilty. However, at that time it will also be possible to subpoena the evidence to see if it proves his guilt.  None of that applies now, because a state is not entitled to human rights.  01 July 2014 (Russia prohibits dirty words)  Russia has found an excuse to ban most foreign and non-conservative literature: a prohibition on certain dirty words.  01 July 2014 (Guantanamo kangaroo courts stuck)  Obama's military kangaroo courts for Guantanamo prisoners are getting stuck on the issue of how the CIA tortured the defendants.  Some of those people may be guilty of real crimes, but if the US can't give them a fair trial because the US tortured them, it has to let them go. Let that be a lesson to us: no torture!  Some fraction of those released may fight the US, but we should not overestimate the importance of that. Violent Islamist groups have thousands of members; a few more won't make much difference. What mainly affects their strength is their ability to recruit.  Guantanamo serves them very well as a recruiting tool, and so does the US refusal to face justice for its torture. Try as they might, a few ex-prisoners won't be able to do the US the sort of harm that the US does to itself.  The US must stop betraying what it stands for, so that it can inspire honest friendship and support around the world, instead of inspiring people to join Islamist fanatic groups.  01 July 2014 (Kiribati prepares for sea rise)  Kiribati has purchased high ground in Fiji as a place to move once the islands of Kiribati are swamped by rising seas.  Does the US government have plans to move the graves of the US Marine cemeteries on Tarawa Atoll?  I don't think there is any intrinsic importance in how corpses are treated (including my own, after my death), but soldiers tend to consider this very important. Many US veterans are right-wing and some are global-heating denialists. This question might offer a way to make them face the facts.  01 July 2014 (Lego-Shell marketing arrangement)  Greenpeace urges Lego to drop a marketing arrangement with Shell.  01 July 2014 (Protester adds labels to dresses)  A clever unknown protester added labels to dresses in a store, saying "'Degrading' sweatshop conditions" and "Forced to work exhausting hours".  The law proposed in this article would be a good step forward, but really we should make the marketing companies that subcontract manufacturing responsible for the working conditions of their whole supply chain.  They should also have to register their subcontractors to all levels, which will have the salutary effect of impeding them from changing their supply chains so often.  01 July 2014 (Thugs licensed to kill protesters)  Peru has given thugs a license to kill protesters.  01 July 2014 (Starbucks "scholarship" program)  Starbucks announced a "scholarship program" for its employees, but it turns out that Starbucks is contributing no money to this, just extracting publicity from it.  01 July 2014 (Reparations owed to US blacks)  The case for paying reparations to US blacks for slavery and oppressive racist laws.  The book Inequality by Design, by Claude Fischer, explains how forcing a group into second-class citizenship affects their descendants too. Thus, I believe the US owes reparations to the descendants of people who suffered a racist denial of equal rights. My ancestors did not participate in doing this, but the reparations must be paid by Americans of today. That includes me.  Of course, the reparations should come mostly from the rich.  01 July 2014 (Drone assassination memo)  The drone assassination memo that the Obama regime released, redacted and incomplete, depends on a body of secret law.  01 July 2014 (Overprotection of children)  Insane overprotection of children in the US has gone beyond social pressure and reached the point of physical threats. A father was arrested in Ohio for not stopping his son from walking to a store.  The store was half a mile away from his home. When I was 8 I walked around that far to school and back every day, in Manhattan.  01 July 2014 (Texas abortion black market)  Texas women must now get their abortion medicine on the black market.  01 July 2014 (Returns on stocks)  Rich people in the US get a far greater return on their stocks than middle-class people.  01 July 2014 (Guantanamo propaganda)  Guantanamo propaganda teams describe hunger strikes as a tactic to discredit the prison authorities and the US government.  This is the twisted logic of someone who adopts the moral premise that "No matter what we have done, it can't ever be wrong."  The prison propagandists also habitually accuse the prisoners of being terrorists, even though none has been convicted of this, and the government says half of them should be released.  01 July 2014 (Congress's ability to study issues)  Republicans in Congress have spent 20 years sabotaging Congress's ability to study issues.  It makes sense. Right-wingers don't want careful study of their proposals; such study might find flaws in them before they are adopted.  01 July 2014 (Foreign workers in Qatar riot)  Foreign construction workers in Qatar, who have to work 14 hours a day, rioted when security guards attacked them for trying to go to the toilet and get water.  01 July 2014 (UK definition of "domestic extremism")  The UK has come up with a definition of "domestic extremist", which when combined with the misleading definition of "serious criminality" allows them to label anyone who might plan a large sit-in as a "domestic extremist".    2014 July - October | Previous (2014 March - June) >>  Each note starts with a date and a brief topic in parentheses.

The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  28 February 2013 (Longer and hotter heat waves)  How global heating makes heat waves longer as well as hotter.  28 February 2013 (Urgent: Oppose punishment by ISPs on behalf of copyright industry)  In the US: tell major US ISPs not to punish their customers on behalf of the copyright industry.  This scheme threatens to wipe out free WiFi in cafes around the US.  28 February 2013 (Urgent: Protect and extend the Voting Rights Act)  US citizens: call for protecting and extending the Voting Rights Act.  28 February 2013 (Urgent: Pursue BP for maximum possible amount of damages)  US citizens: call on the US government not to offer BP a deal, but rather to pursue it for the maximum possible amount of damages.  28 February 2013 (Being annoying)  Feminism cannot win if it limits itself to what won't annoy male privilege (i.e., doesn't rock the patriarchal boat).  We can transpose most of this directly to the free software movement: it can't win if it limits itself to what won't annoy the developers and users of proprietary software.  28 February 2013 (Urgent: Call on Cablevision to rehire workers)  US citizens: call on Cablevision to rehire the workers they locked out and make an honest deal with the union.  28 February 2013 (China refuses to publish results of pollution study)  China refuses to publish the results of a study on soil pollution, figuring that it doesn't want people to know how bad things are.  Compare this with coverups of global heating by other governments.  28 February 2013 (How big food companies treat farming communities and workers)  Rating big food companies on how they treat farming communities and workers. They do a bad job.  The real solution has to be through laws and treaties.  28 February 2013 (Getting under 6 hours of sleep per night affects function of genes)  Getting under 6 hours of sleep for several nights affects the functioning of many genes, including some affecting the immune system.  I've learned that I tend to catch a cold if I miss sleep for a few nights.  28 February 2013 (Baby dies in care of privatized medical service)  A baby died in the UK after getting inadequate treatment because a privatized medical service overloaded the insufficient number of doctors.  It is not certain the baby would have been saved with proper treatment, but it might have been, so the problem was a real one.  Privatizing the implementation of a government service generally leads to such results. The company, to get a profit, has to squeeze someone &mdash; typically either its employees or the public that the service is provided to. Worse, privatization is often presented as a way to "reduce costs", which means the company is under pressure to squeeze.  The only case in which privatization is legitimate is when it enables the public to buy in a market with effective competition. But that is not necessarily a good option in all activities: there are natural monopolies, where it isn't one.  28 February 2013 (Catholic Church's hostility to homosexuality)  The Catholic Church's hostility to homosexuality is fueled by large numbers of repressed homosexual priests.  28 February 2013 (Urgent: Increase civilian spending)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and say to cut the Pentagon, not civilian spending. Even better, increase civilian spending by the same amount that the Pentagon is cut, since we need deficit spending to end the recession.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  28 February 2013 (US Banks profit by being too big to fail)  The biggest US banks effectively get all their profits from the unfair advantage of being too big to fail.  28 February 2013 (Drones and total surveillance)  Drones Over There, Total Surveillance Over Here.  28 February 2013 (A better plan than "endless growth")  A Better Plan Than 'Endless Growth': Enough Is Enough.  28 February 2013 (Urgent: Call on Amgen to give back $500 million)  US citizens: call on Amgen to give back the 500 million dollar giveaway extracted in the "fiscal cliff" deal.  28 February 2013 (Urgent: Cut the Pentagon)  US citizens: call on Congress to cut the Pentagon.  28 February 2013 (BP trial begins)  The trial of Billionaire Polluters has begun.  This could be an exception to the modern rule that the US never actually takes a company to court. But it is just a civil suit: nobody will go to jail for willfully inviting regional disaster.  28 February 2013 (The 2013 Hypocrisy Oscars)  The 2013 Hypocrisy Oscars.  28 February 2013 (The Federal Reserve could fix the economy)  How the Fed Could Fix the Economy and Why It Hasn't.  28 February 2013 (What if Iranian thugs waterboarded an American?)  What would Americans think if Iranian thugs waterboarded an American?  28 February 2013 (Bright street lights)  Bright light on the street at night is reputed to reduce crime, but it's not clear that this is true. However, the light can harm health of people and wildlife.  It could be that a bright light on one block makes street criminals prefer to attack on another block, but that bright lights all across the city have no overall effect. Anyway, street crime has gone down greatly in the US. The main danger of crime for Americans today is from banksters.  28 February 2013 (Blackwater executives get slap on wrist)  Blackwater executives faced serious criminal charges, but were let off with a slap on the wrist.  28 February 2013 (Indian gov't assists with corporate land-grabbing in Ethiopia)  The Indian government helps corporations take land from the poor in Ethiopia just as in India.  A corporate land grab is just as bad when the corporation is Indian as when the corporation is Chinese or American.  27 February 2013 (Control of seeds)  Vandana Shiva: seeds must be in the hands of farmers.  27 February 2013 (How global heating will effect New York summers)  Global heating will make working in New York summers harder than working today in Bahrain.  27 February 2013 (Urgent: Rebuke Coca Cola Company)  US citizens: rebuke Coca Cola Company for campaigning against deposits on beverage bottles.  If you participate (as I do) in the boycott of all Coca Cola Company products, that is no reason not to sign this petition (I signed it).  27 February 2013 (UN denies responsibility for cholera deaths)  The UN declared itself not responsible for Haitians infected or killed by the cholera brought to Haiti by the UN intervention force. Here are arguments against the validity of the UN's dictate.  27 February 2013 (Lions headed towards extinction)  Lions are following tigers towards extinction, due to expanding human land-use which destroys them and their prey.  This is one of many reasons why it is vital to stop the growth of human population, in Africa as elsewhere.  27 February 2013 (Human trash on deep ocean floor)  Explorers of the deep ocean floor find that human trash has preceded them.  27 February 2013 (UK gov't creates excuse to cut support to the disabled)  The cruel UK government has created an excuse to cut support to the disabled. Disabled athletes are using their fame to campaign against the cuts.  Every "reform" that this government makes in social welfare is simply a veiled way to take from the poor and give to the rich. They combine each cut in welfare with a reorganization that is supposed to provide some improvement in efficiency, but that is a mere distraction since the real point is the cut.  27 February 2013 (Two Egyptian parties boycott coming elections)  Two Egyptian parties have decided to boycott the coming elections.  27 February 2013 (Norwegian prison rehabilitates prisoners)  A Norwegian prison that runs like a village achieves amazing results: only 16% of the prisoners reoffend after their release.  The US used to treat prisoners better, but in the 1980s the number of prisoners was enormously increased and rehabilitation was discarded as a goal. Nowadays the prison-industrial complex, which includes private prison companies and the use of prisoners as cheap labor to undermine wages for other Americans, stand in the way of any attempt to reduce the number of prisoners and redirect prison towards reducing crime rather than sadism.  27 February 2013 (Islamist fanatics attack journalists)  Islamist fanatics in Bangladesh attacked journalists in several cities at once.  27 February 2013 (Wide use of water torture by US prison guards in Vietnam)  Water torture and other torture was widely used by US prison guards in Vietnam. The victims included enemy prisoners and US soldiers.  What does it mean when the state defines this as normal?  27 February 2013 (Development of autonomous robot killers)  The US and other countries are developing autonomous robot killers.  27 February 2013 (US special forces ordered to leave after reports of torture)  Karzai ordered US special forces to leave one province after reports that they tortured and disappeared civilians.  27 February 2013 (Israeli thugs torture Palestinian prisoner to death)  It appears Israeli thugs tortured a Palestinian prisoner to death.  Then they tried to cover it up by claiming he had had a heart attack, but it is very unusual for a 30-year-old man to get those.  27 February 2013 (Low social mobility in the US and UK)  The US and UK have very low social mobility, and cutbacks in support for education are making it worse.  As a result, the wealthy in the US and UK got that way mostly by being lucky in their parents.  27 February 2013 (NRA: No Research Allowed)  NRA stands for "No Research Allowed" (about gun violence).  27 February 2013 (Sea level rise in Louisiana)  Louisiana planning has underestimated sea level rise, which proves to be effectively higher there than anywhere else, because the land there is sinking rapidly. The result is that new flood protections will be inadequate when they are finished.  26 February 2013 (Imprisonment without trial in Israel)  Human Rights Watch calls on Israel to end imprisonment without trial.  It would be so much easier to pressure governments around the world to end imprisonment without trial if they did not have the bad example of the US to cite.  26 February 2013 (Indonesia considers law to ban criticism)  Indonesia is considering a law to ban mass organizations from criticizing the constitution or the state-mandated religious views.  The law would also allow the state to "suspend" organizations arbitrarily, a violation of human rights that imitates the unjust policy of the US.  26 February 2013 (Complex innovation in finance)  Three magic words for a Wall Street lobbyist: "innovation," "complexity" and "liquidity".  Complex innovation in finance is an opportunity for cheating, so banning it should be an explicit political goal. Innovation brought us the economy that serves only financial tycoons, so let's ban those innovations and make the economy simple enough that we can regulate it properly.  26 February 2013 (Honduran officer threatens journalists)  A Honduran officer threatened journalists that cover land grabs, as well as those who try to oppose them.  The ones who truly besmirch the image (and honor) of the Honduran nation are the rulers of that country, who carried out a US-supported coup.  26 February 2013 (Urgent: Free Hassan Ruvakuki)  Everyone: sign this petition to free Hassan Ruvakuki.  26 February 2013 (Thugs attack protesting Burundian journalists)  Thugs attacked Burundian journalists who protested the imprisonment of another journalist, Hassan Ruvakuki, for interviewing a rebel leader.  The state later confirmed the fundamental injustice of its actions by claiming that the journalists were making an illegal demonstration.  More information about Hassan Ruvakuki.  26 February 2013 (Corporate-named sports venues)  "Owlcatraz" and 9 Other Terrible Corporate-Named Sports Venues.  What's really wrong here is that selling the naming of a stadium to a company expresses the idea that the whole city is for sale. The impetus for this comes from taxes that are too low.  26 February 2013 (Newspaper uses copyright to shut down parody site)  A newspaper in Brazil has used copyright to shut down a parody site.  26 February 2013 (Obama golfs with fossil fuel executives)  As global heating protesters marched on the White House, Obama was in Florida playing golf with fossil fuel executives.  26 February 2013 (US fracking limits)  Claims that US fracking will only provide natural gas for 25 years.  Since continuing to burn fossil fuels leads to disaster, we need to cut back anyway.  26 February 2013 (Political injustices pressure Americans towards obesity)  When we consider obesity in the US, let's not forget the political injustices that pressure many Americans towards obesity and ill health.  26 February 2013 (New technology and low-level conflicts)  New technology encourages various kinds of permanent low-level conflict.  26 February 2013 (Food processing companies continue promoting baby formula)  Large food processing companies continue to encourage women to give babies formula rather than their own milk.  26 February 2013 (Psychological stress of living near Fukushima)  Inhabitants of the region around Fukushima experience continuing psychological stress. This wears away at their families.  26 February 2013 (UK farms wiped out by repeated flooding)  Farms in the UK are being wiped out by repeated flooding.  Global heating is responsible for the frequency of flooding in the UK, and it is expected to get worse.  26 February 2013 (Prosecution of Bradley Manning)  The prosecution of Bradley Manning is terrorizing others who have witnessed abuses in the US government.  26 February 2013 (Motivation for prosecution of Aaron Swartz)  The prosecution of Aaron Swartz was motivated by government opposition to his political views.  Obama continues to be public enemy number 1 where copyright is concerned.  26 February 2013 (Egypt proposes restrictions on NGOs and protests)  Egypt proposes to ban NGOs from having "contact" with "international entities" and restrict protests.  26 February 2013 (Peaceful protesters attacked in Yemen)  Yemen's suppression forces attacked peaceful protesters again.  26 February 2013 (Faz&#305;l Say faces prosecution for "religious defamation")  Faz&#305;l Say, prominent Turkish classical musician, is facing prosecution for "religious defamation", along with thousands of others.  26 February 2013 (Urgent: Abolition of death penalty)  US citizens: encourage the Governor of Maryland to push for abolition of the death penalty there.  26 February 2013 (Questions about TPP)  Questions about TPP that Obama and Abe will not want to hear.  26 February 2013 (US court openly discards fundamental principle of contracts)  A US court has openly discarded the principle that a contract is valid only if the parties had a "meeting of the minds".  The reason given was that exploitative imposed contracts are too important to be doubted.  26 February 2013 (Facebook helps stores track users' purchases)  Facebook cooperates with store purchaser identification cards to track users' purchases.  You can confuse them using someone else's discount card or number.  26 February 2013 (Bradley Manning's 1000th day in prison)  Bradley Manning's 1000th day in prison was marked by worldwide protests against Obama's attack on journalism.  Prosecutors have admitted that they would accuse anyone publishing leaked secrets, such as the Pentagon Papers, of "aiding the enemy". Effect, the US equates the public with "the enemy".  26 February 2013 (Genetically engineered mosquitos)  Genetically engineered mosquitos could block diseases, but they could backfire too.  26 February 2013 (Urgent: Call on Obama to file brief for marriage equality)  US citizens: call on Obama to file a brief for marriage equality in a case facing the Supreme Court.  26 February 2013 (Main opposition TV station in Venezuela)  Venezuela appears to be planning to close the main opposition TV station by excluding it from the move to digital broadcasting.  26 February 2013 (Palestinian cartoonist imprisoned)  A Palestinian political cartoonist has been imprisoned in Israel without charges.  25 February 2013 (Spanish locksmiths and firemen won't help with evictions)  Spanish locksmiths and firemen are refusing to participate in evictions, saying they are not puppets of the banksters.  25 February 2013 (What if China used a drone to kill the Dalai Lama?)  Imagine that China used a drone to kill the Dalai Lama &mdash; what would we say about it, and what does that imply about US drone-based assassinations?  25 February 2013 (Organic tomatoes)  A study found organic tomatoes nutritionally superior to conventionally grown tomatoes.  I won't take the conclusion as established by one study, but it is interesting.  25 February 2013 (Undermining data protection law)  The committees of the European Parliament are undermining data protection law at the request of Internet companies.  More information.  25 February 2013 (Republicans ask Supreme Court to reduce voter protection)  As Republicans find ever more dishonest ways to stop poor and minority Americans from voting, they are asking the Supreme Court to reduce the protection against these dirty tricks.  25 February 2013 (NY Times' accusations against President Correa)  The New York Times accused President Correa of expanding the power of the president and threatening the independence of the press.  Funny that it doesn't say the same about Bush and Obama, who have really done these things. I never heard anyone accuse Correa of claiming the power to order assassinations.  25 February 2013 (Latest bogus excuse for Keystone XL)  The latest bogus excuse for the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline is to avoid getting oil from Venezuela.  Venezuela would simply sell the oil elsewhere, and the only way it would hurt Venezuela is if the price of oil went down due to an oversupply. That would be an even bigger global disaster, since it would result in increased combustion of fossil fuel.  25 February 2013 (Obama orders federal agencies to make research results available)  Obama has ordered federal agencies that support substantial amounts of research to set up a system to make all the research results available to the public within a year.  This is an important advance; however, it could easily have been better. The use of the term "open access" has led to an omission: this regulation says nothing about releasing these articles under a license that permits redistribution or other reuse.  25 February 2013 (Boat people fleeing Burma without boat engine)  Boat people fleeing Burma say a Thai navy ship took the engine out of their boat and left them to drift, without water supplies.  I am not sure I believe it. Removing the engine from a boat is a big operation, unless it was an outboard motor. And a boat that had room for 130 passengers probably wasn't equipped with an outboard motor.  25 February 2013 (Urgent: Protect state-licensed medical marijuana providers and users)  US citizens: tell Congress to protect state-licensed medical marijuana providers and users from federal prosecution.  25 February 2013 (Urgent: Correct Senator Graham)  US citizens: tell Senator Graham that referring to the occupation of Palestine as "apartheid" is not hostility to Israel; many Israeli ministers have said exactly that.  25 February 2013 (Urgent: Oppose appointment of Ernest Moniz)  US citizens: call on Obama not to appoint Ernest Moniz, fracking supporter, as head of the Department of Energy.  25 February 2013 (Extreme secrecy in the trial of Bradley Manning)  The trial of Bradley Manning demonstrates the extreme secrecy one would expect to find in a state that prosecutes journalists.  25 February 2013 (Printer DRM)  Printer ink cartridges are a rip-off due to DRM in the printers.  This sort of forced tying of products should be banned by law.  25 February 2013 (The sequester)  5 Ways The Sequester Could Make You Sick.  25 February 2013 (Gasoline tax in the US)  The Case for a Higher Gasoline Tax (in the US).  24 February 2013 (FBI employees punished for wide range of disobedience)  Many FBI employees have been punished for a wide range of disobedience.  It is legitimate to fire employees whose activities make it hard for the office to get work done. On the other hand, to criticize staff for using a computer to do something other than work is too strict. Harmless off-duty activities, such as doing business with a prostitute, are none of the employer's business.  24 February 2013 (Keystone XL decision)  Keystone XL decision will define Barack Obama's legacy on climate change.  24 February 2013 (Computerized monitoring of employees)  Computerized monitoring of employees, second by second, makes work like prison.  In the US, these companies don't have to care about the effect of stress on the employees, who will be fired when they can no longer keep up; and then they can die of stress for all the company cares.  24 February 2013 (Kicked off a United flight for taking a photo)  A travel blogger was kicked off a United flight for taking a photo of his seat. Apparently this made a flight attendant decide to lie to get him kicked off the plane.  The author was the victim of the system that allows any crew member to kick anyone off a plane for no reason at all. That makes every passenger vulnerable to any jerk who wants to feel powerful or compensate for anxiety.  My special rebuke is for commenters who said things like "Using that word was not very smart." We should never criticize people for failing to kowtow to unjustified demands &mdash; not even if the demands are predictable. The premise of that argument is legitimization of an injustice.  Instead of demanding an apology to this person, we should demand United change its policy for all of us.  24 February 2013 (Advances in 3D printing stifled by patents)  Advances in 3D printing will be off limits due to many patents.  24 February 2013 (Food marketing by junk food companies)  How junk food companies unlocked food marketing that inevitably drives humans towards obesity.  24 February 2013 (Why US medical bills are so high)  How a system of multiple levels of gouging makes US medical bills so high that most Americans can be bankrupted by a medical problem.  The solution is clearly Medicare for all Americans.  Here's the full story.  24 February 2013 (EPA delays regulations on hexavalent chromium)  The EPA delayed regulations to protect Americans from hexavalent chromium at the recommendation of a committee of scientists with financial interests in that decision.  This is effectively a kind of corruption, and it is very common, since the EPA only makes a show of trying to avoid it. I suspect that too is the result of business influence in the EPA (regulatory capture).  24 February 2013 (Urgent: Save the US Postal Service)  US citizens: call on Congress to save the US Postal Service, not destroy it.  I added this statement:  Voting by mail creates a risk of vote-selling, and should not be encouraged. However, that doesn't alter the need to save the USPS.   24 February 2013 (Urgent: Stop destruction of rainforest for palm oil plantations)  US citizens: tell an agribusiness company not to destroy rainforest in Cameroon for palm oil plantations.  24 February 2013 (Egypt buys 140,000 teargas canisters)  Egypt has bought 140,000 teargas canisters, upholding increasing repression of protesters.  24 February 2013 (Governor of Florida agrees to extend Medicaid)  The governor of Florida has agreed to accept federal funds to extend medicaid.  24 February 2013 (Working 40 hours in four 10-hour days)  Working 40 hours in 4 10-hour days was a great success in Utah.  24 February 2013 (Blackmail of gay cardinals in th Vatican)  Reportedly there is a group of gay cardinals in the Vatican and some are being blackmailed about it.  24 February 2013 (Pentagon budget cuts)  The Pentagon has chosen to implement the sequester cuts in a very painful way as a sort of suicide threat to demand more money.  24 February 2013 (Gasoline prices pushed up by Iran sanctions)  Iran sanctions have pushed up world gasoline prices.  This is good, since it will cause people to use less. The US government ought to impose a windfall profit tax so that the treasury gets some of this money.  24 February 2013 (Fracking can destroy organic farming)  Fracking can destroy organic farming, as farms won't be able to get clean water.  24 February 2013 (Urgent: Call on Walmart to enforce its standards)  US citizens: call on Walmart to enforce its standards for suppliers.  Companies often wish to establish these codes so they can convince people they are "socially responsible", then ignore them.  24 February 2013 (Urgent: Protect water supplies)  US citizens: call on the EPA to protect water supplies from waste from factor farms.  24 February 2013 (Urgent: Oppose CISPA)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to oppose CISPA. Also send message through this page.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  24 February 2013 (Microsoft wants copyright on programming interfaces)  Microsoft wants copyright on programming interfaces.  24 February 2013 (Urgent: Prosecute rapist instead of rape victim)  Everyone: pressure the government of Somalia to prosecute the rapist instead of the rape victim.  24 February 2013 (Corporate looter targets Social Security system)  A corporate looter wants to loot the Social Security system.  To do it, he has created the appearance of a diverse grass-roots movement.  24 February 2013 (Reckless Use of Technology)  Society provides plenty of incentive to develop new products, but nobody has much incentive to check whether they cause harm.  24 February 2013 (Independent bookstores sue Amazon)  Independent bookstores have sued Amazon and large publishers saying that their ebook contracts restrain trade.  24 February 2013 (Australia's fossil fuel export)  Australia's biggest export is fossil fuel, and the results have come back in the form of a record-breaking heat wave.  I disagree with one point: if the emission tax was passed on by power companies to their customers, that is not a bad thing. That is intended. The intent of the tax is not to reduce those companies' profits but rather to discourage use.  24 February 2013 (Thugs in Zimbabwe seize radios)  Thugs in Zimbabwe are seizing radios so that people cannot get news.  23 February 2013 (FBI's community outreach program)  Is the FBI's Community Outreach Program a Trojan Horse?  23 February 2013 (Drones with cameras)  A drone carrying the ARGUS camera will allow Big Brother to track everyone's movements in a city.  Individuals use cheap camera drones too, and they too raise a privacy issue.  What we need to avoid is the path of restricting the general public while giving Big Brother a free hand.  23 February 2013 (One-day general strike shuts down Greece)  A one-day general strike shut down Greece, and even usually conservative farmers supported it.  23 February 2013 (Blocking Keystone XL to punish Canada's right-wing gov't)  Blocking Keystone XL would be a good way to punish Canada's right-wing government for anti-environmental policies.  23 February 2013 (The thugs of South Africa)  The thugs of South Africa are rampant killers, and openly demand impunity.  23 February 2013 (The new "breakthrough prize in life sciences")  How the new "breakthrough prize in life sciences" is misconceived at several levels.  23 February 2013 (Oxford debate on occupation of Palestine)  George Galloway walked out of a debate about the occupation of Palestine on learning that his opponent was an Israeli.  The opponent, Eylon Aslan-Levy, advocated an end to the occupation through a peace treaty. I think that would be a good outcome, though as Uri Avnery has explained, Netanyahu wants negotiations for such a treaty only with a view towards dragging them out and never reaching an agreement.  23 February 2013 (US states cannot get poison for executions)  Thanks to a boycott by European companies, US states cannot get poison to carry out executions with.  23 February 2013 (The violence faced by environmental activists)  Around the world, environmental activists have faced violence.  23 February 2013 (Siberian permafrost)  A temperature rise of 1.5C (from past baseline) would cause Siberian permafrost to melt, triggering massive additional long-term release of greenhouse gas.  It appears humanity lacks the political will to hold short of 2C of heating, which means this is going to kick in and make it worse.  23 February 2013 (How a US gov't strategy document classifies Wikileaks)  A US government strategy document classifies Wikileaks as a criminal spying organization.  23 February 2013 (Use of "tea talks" to intimidate dissidents in China)  Chinese political thugs use compulsory informal interrogations to intimidate dissidents.  23 February 2013 (Censorship of controversial ideas in India)  In India, controversial ideas are met with censorship, even imprisonment.  23 February 2013 (Compensation for Nigerian town decimated by soldiers)  The Nigerian Supreme Court ordered compensation of $240 million for a town whose population was killed by soldiers.  23 February 2013 (Private prison company tries to whitewash atrocities)  A private prison company hopes that sponsoring a school football team will give it a favorable image.  23 February 2013 (Documentaries about Israeli occupation of Palestine)  Two documentaries about the Israeli occupation of Palestine are competing for the Best Documentary award.  23 February 2013 (California bill could be used in War on Drugs)  A California bill would ban people from driving for a week after they smoke pot.  23 February 2013 (Lawns in the US)  In the US, it is misguided to have a lawn.  23 February 2013 (Obama wants kill list memos kept permanently secret)  Obama Maneuvers to Keep Kill List Memos Permanently Secret.  22 February 2013 (Democrats and Republicans both approve of aerial death squads)  Both Democrats and Republicans say that US aerial death squads are justified because the US respects human life.  On the contrary, the death squads show that the US doesn't respect human rights or human life. Ms Pelosi should realize that there is nothing to prevent her from being the next target. Perhaps that would be more likely when there is an officially Republican president, but that will happen.  22 February 2013 (US agents detain Palestinian director en route to Oscars)  Palestinian director Emad Burnat almost couldn't get to the Oscar award ceremony because US agents would not believe a Palestinian was being considered for an award.  22 February 2013 (Police in Canada giving "positive tickets")  Police in one part of Canada began giving "positive tickets" to youths for doing various good things.  I think this has a chance of working where teenagers don't have a valid reason to think that the thugs aim at repressing them. It would have trouble functioning in New York City, for instance.  22 February 2013 (Afghanistan and Pakistan cooperating)  Afghanistan and Pakistan are now cooperating to catch Taliban leaders.  22 February 2013 (Coal plant company in UK aims to crush right to protest)  A coal plant company in the UK aims to crush the right to protest by suing when the protest is effective.  22 February 2013 (Confessions obtained through torture)  Those accused of crimes in Dubai are often tortured into signing confessions they can't read.  22 February 2013 (Urgent: Join a rally to cut the Pentagon)  US citizens: join a rally on Feb 27 to cut the Pentagon rather than cutting what Americans need.  22 February 2013 (Banksters want repeat of 2008 financial crisis)  The 2008 financial crisis cost Americans (not counting banksters) over 10 trillion dollars, and banksters want to make sure it happens again.  22 February 2013 (Individual campaign donations)  The US Supreme Court is planning to abolish individual campaign donation limits, which were found constitutional by the Supreme Court 40 years ago.  22 February 2013 (Greenpeace's campaign against nuclear industry)  'You Profit, We Pay': Greenpeace Launches Global Campaign Against Nuclear Industry.  22 February 2013 (Using the state to benefit the non-rich)  In most of Latin America, governments show that using the state to benefit the non-rich works well.  They use policies that, according to right-wing economists, should lead to disaster, and over and over show that they bring benefits. Why are the economists so wrong? Perhaps because they are biased.  22 February 2013 (Donald Trump trying to intimidate person running petition)  Donald Trump is trying to intimidate a person who is running a petition asking Macy's to stop promoting Trump's business.  I had never heard of the issue, and I have no opinion about Trump otherwise, but this sort of threat deserves punishment.  22 February 2013 (Tunisia's prime minister resigns)  Tunisia's Islamist prime minister has resigned.  21 February 2013 (Execution of mentally retarded man postponed)  The execution of a mentally retarded man was postponed in Georgia; an appeals court will consider whether it is just to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that someone is retarded.  That law should be abolished because it is mean-spirited, but I don't see any reason why the ethics of the death penalty should depend on a person's intelligence level. The death penalty is simply wrong. It is wrong to execute people of low intelligence, or normal intelligence, and even people of superior intelligence.  21 February 2013 (Overprotective adults make children fearful)  Overprotective adults have made many children fear to leave the house.  21 February 2013 (Sectarian strife in Iraq)  Iraq appears heading for unending sectarian strife.  21 February 2013 (Assad treating all civilians as hostages)  Assad holds on to power by treating all civilians as hostages.  21 February 2013 (UK ministers pressured to punish protesters more heavily)  A UK power company pressured ministers to punish protesters more heavily or it would withdraw investments.  The crime of "aggravated trespass" was invented to punish protesters, so it ought to be abolished in the name of democracy.  21 February 2013 (Urgent: Tell Congress to oppose CISPA)  US citizens: tell Congress to oppose CISPA.  21 February 2013 (Export of agricultural produce from Palestine)  The Israeli occupation creates tremendous obstacles for Palestinians to export agricultural produce.  21 February 2013 (Israeli soldiers shoot at protesters)  Palestinians held protests in support of prisoners on hunger strike, and soldiers shot at them.  21 February 2013 (An Israeli suggestion for peace)  An Israeli suggestion for peace: release Marwan Barghouti from prison so he can lead Palestine to an agreement that will hold.  Netanyahu won't do it, of course. The last thing he wants is peace, because he'd have to stop the land grab.  21 February 2013 (Israelis no longer shocked when soldiers steal from Palestinian homes)  With the theft of Palestinian land and water as the example, Israelis cease to be shocked when soldiers steal money from Palestinian homes.  21 February 2013 (Court-ordered rerouting of Palestinian annexation wall)  The Palestinian village of Jayous got a court order to reroute the annexation wall so it would confiscate only a part of the village's land. So colonists built an unauthorized "outpost" to block the new route, with the dishonest army helping.  21 February 2013 (Urgent: Protect endangered Florida panthers)  US citizens: sign this petition to strengthen protection of endangered Florida panthers.  21 February 2013 (Corporate media ignores march against Keystone XL pipeline)  The corporate media largely ignored the march against the Keystone XL pipeline.  21 February 2013 (Urgent: Support HR 198)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to co-sponsor HR 198, to repeal the authorization for worldwide military attacks against anyone connectable with al Qa'ida.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  21 February 2013 (Latin America's non-cooperation with the CIA)  How Latin America became the only inhabited region of Earth where the CIA couldn't get cooperation for torture.  21 February 2013 (Canadian military-industrial lobby wants another war)  The Canadian military-industrial lobby wants another war.  21 February 2013 (New York Times doesn't mention cause of drought in Mississippi)  The New York Times covers how people keep traffic moving on the Mississippi despite the drought, but doesn't mention that people caused the drought.  21 February 2013 (Advertisements presented as journalism)  It has become standard practice in major US media outlets to present advertisements as journalism.  21 February 2013 (Urgent: Reject candidates who support "all of the above" energy strategy)  US citizens: pledge you won't vote for candidates that support "all of the above" for energy including fossil fuels.  21 February 2013 (BBC comedy series designed to mock Craig Murray)  A BBC comedy series is designed to mock Craig Murray, with the help of the UK Diplomatic Service from which he resigned in protest.  21 February 2013 (Civilian casualties in Afghanistan)  In 2012, the US and NATO reduced the civilian casualties they cause in Afghanistan, but the Taliban caused more civilian casualties, and seem to target women.  21 February 2013 (Logic of surveillance)  The Logic of Surveillance.  21 February 2013 (The Pirate Bay uses irony to fight back)  The Pirate Bay Reports Anti-Piracy Outfit to the Police.  21 February 2013 (If Obama reduces payments to US drug companies)  US drug companies say the sky will fall on them if Obama succeeds in reducing their payments back to the previous level.  What would happen if we did what really needs to be done, and block their corruption of medical science?  20 February 2013 (Urgent: End intervention in Afghanistan)  US citizens: tell Obama to end the intervention in Afghanistan soon.  20 February 2013 (Global heating making rains heavier)  Global heating is making heavy rains heavier, globally.  20 February 2013 (Protest by opposition in Papua New Guinea)  The opposition in Papua New Guinea protested against feared electoral fraud.  20 February 2013 (Hamas represses dissent and oppresses women)  In Gaza, Hamas represses dissent and oppresses women.  20 February 2013 (Funneling money to right-wing "think tanks")  How billionaires funnel money to right-wing "think tanks" that really function as political propaganda fronts. This include over a hundred organizations that oppose efforts to stop global heating.  20 February 2013 (Belarus border guard sent to prison for not reporting teddy bear drop)  A border guard in Belarus was sentenced to prison for failing to report a plane that dropped teddy bears with human rights messages.  20 February 2013 (Rebels and regime soldier in Syrian town make peace)  In one Syrian town, rebels and regime soldiers have made a  local peace.  20 February 2013 (Egyptian editor forced out by Muslim Brotherhood)  A senior Egyptian editor who resigned says he was forced out by the Muslim Brotherhood.  20 February 2013 (Koch brothers' oil refinery not designed for US crude)  Part of the pressure for the Keystone XL pipeline is that the Koch brothers' oil refinery wasn't designed for US crude oil. It was designed for crude oil from Venezuela.  20 February 2013 (Sea Shepherd continues blocking Japanese whaling)  Despite an injunction in the US, other countries' branches of Sea Shepherd continue blocking Japanese whaling.  20 February 2013 (Indian gov't orders ISP to block criticism)  The Indian government ordered ISP to block a long list of articles that criticise Indian Institute of Planning and Management, which passes itself off as an accredited school.  20 February 2013 (Companies so big they can get away with breaking any law)  The US now admits, as official policy, that some companies are so big that they can get away with breaking any law.  20 February 2013 (Creating money to pay for energy efficiency improvements)  A central bank can create money to pay for energy efficiency improvements, and boost the economy while reducing CO2 emissions, and without giving the banksters a cut.  20 February 2013 (Nissan uses threats to stop unionization)  Nissan manufacturing in the US is using nasty pressure and threats to try to stop unionization.  This shows that the US needs laws to support unionization.  20 February 2013 (School privatization in Sweden)  Arguing that school privatization works well in Sweden.  It is noteworthy that in Sweden it did not involve crushing unions. I wonder, though, whether a large fraction of the non-state schools there perform religious indoctrination and get church subsidies.  20 February 2013 (Image of Palestinian child seen through sniper rifle sight)  An Israeli sniper posted an image of a Palestinian child's head as seen through a sniper rifle sight.  The posting of that image was not an evil in itself, it was a symptom. The image may have hurt some feelings, but if posting an image were the worst thing that the Israeli army did to Palestinians, they would be much better off. What oppresses them is the occupation. This image reveals the hatred that expresses itself more frequently through killing.  20 February 2013 ("True capitalism")  For the cult of the Invisible Hand, anything that works badly is not "true capitalism".  Actually there are many kinds of capitalism. The US in 1970 enjoyed the benefits of capitalism with democracy. Today it suffers the rampage of capitalism with plutocracy.  20 February 2013 (Meat consumption in wealthy countries)  Wealthy countries should cut meat consumption in half.  20 February 2013 (NGOs helping the poor resist land grabs)  Cooperation with rich country NGOs is helping poor people around the world resist land grabs.  20 February 2013 (Communication between Guantanamo lawyers and clients)  Guantanamo defense lawyers explain how both voice and written communication with their clients appears to be being monitored, and say it means they cannot carry out their responsibility.  They have a duty to resign if so. But there is another factor that constantly pressures them not to do a proper job: the likelihood they will be punished if they succeed.  20 February 2013 (NY City can cut CO2 emissions by 90%)  New York City (and other big cities) can cut their CO2 emissions by 90% using energy efficiency techniques.  20 February 2013 (Protest against planet-roaster pipeline)  35,000 protesters opposed the planet-roaster pipeline in Washington DC.  20 February 2013 (Urgent: Vote on nomination of Richard Cordray)  US citizens: phone your senators and call for a vote on the nomination of Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  20 February 2013 (Urgent: End subsidies to companies that don't pay living wage)  US citizens: call on Obama to end subsidies to companies that don't pay a living wage.  20 February 2013 (Urgent: Stop the Keystone XL planet roaster pipeline)  US citizens: tell Obama not to allow the Keystone XL planet roaster pipeline.  20 February 2013 (Citizen volunteers put in new benches in London)  After part of London removed public benches so as to harass homeless people, citizen volunteers put in new benches.  20 February 2013 (Combining multiple genetic modifications in crops)  Combining multiple genetic modifications in crops gives unpredictable results &mdash; it seems they interfere.  19 February 2013 (Libya threatens foreign Christians with execution)  Foreign Christians face the threat of execution for proselytizing in Libya.  I suppose the government will make a deal to expel them instead, rather than face foreign displeasure. Nonetheless, this shows how most Muslim countries do not respect religious freedom. Pakistan threatened to kill secularist Dr. Younus Shaikh for "blasphemy". Even Malaysia, which in general seems less extremist, forbids anyone of Malay origin to be  anything but a Muslim.  Next time someone objects to burning a Qur'an, or to a cartoon about Muhammad, the simple response is to point to this and say, "Here you see our way of criticizing a religion &mdash; we think this is more civilized than arresting and killing the people who promote it."  Islamic law is oppression, especially of women but also of men. If Libya turns to Islamic law, I will conclude that the Western intervention against Gaddafi only made things worse.  19 February 2013 (Obama's choice to head the SEC enters through revolving door)  The revolving door swings vigorously between the SEC and large companies. Obama's choice to head the SEC has been a lawyer for companies that the SEC regulates.  So either she will now use her knowledge to stop them from getting away with highway robbery &mdash; or she will use it to help them do more of it.  Based on Obama's track record, I expect the latter.  19 February 2013 (Suicide of ex-soldiers)  The suicide of ex-soldiers is partly due to moral injuries from horrible choices they were compelled to decide.  These situations are known as "moral bad luck".  19 February 2013 (BBC demands power to control your operating system)  The BBC demands the power to control your operating system.  19 February 2013 (Obama wants harsh punishments for people who share)  Obama wants harsh punishments for people who share.  19 February 2013 (Worst typhoon ever recorded)  The worst typhoon ever recorded is just part of what global heating is doing to the Philippines.  Remember, the temperature rise is going to accelerate, as the CO2 level rises and positive feedbacks operate.  19 February 2013 (Pakistan not pursuing the Sunni fanatics that kill Shi'ites)  It looks like Pakistan is not trying to pursue the Sunni fanatics that regularly massacre Shi'ites.  19 February 2013 (Buddha statues banned in Iran)  Buddha statues are now banned in Iran.  19 February 2013 (New planting technique gets higher yields)  A new planting technique enables Indian farmers to get far higher yields with fewer seeds and less fertilizer.  19 February 2013 (Gunmen try to assassinate journalist in Sri Lanka)  Unknown gunmen tried to assassinate an opposition journalist in Sri Lanka, following a pattern of such attacks, that clearly must come from the state.  19 February 2013 (Spy agencies push for UK secret courts bill)  The push for the UK secret courts bill comes from the spy agencies it is designed to protect from justice.  Amendments made in the House of Lords to compensate for part of the harm have been removed.  19 February 2013 (Karzai's use of NATO air power)  Karzai is in a quandary about using NATO air power. Without it, his troops have trouble fighting the Taliban. With it, they kill civilians.  19 February 2013 (Nuclear waste depot at Hanford leaking)  A nuclear waste depot at Hanford is leaking, again.  19 February 2013 (Approval for assaults on human rights when Obama is does them)  Prominent Obama supporters now admit that they support Bush-league assaults on human rights when Obama is doing them.  To trust a person with power to imprison and kill at will, whoever that person may be, is to establish a dictatorship. The US tree is rotten in the core with dictatorship, but it has not yet shown in all the leaves.  19 February 2013 (NDAA gives Obama power to arrest, imprison and torture)  The NDAA authorizes Obama to arrest anyone, hold him in military prison, and hand him over for torture in another country. Reports from the trial (which found it unconstitutional) show how the Obombers are arguing for that power, and how far it might be stretched.  19 February 2013 (Republican scheme to rig next Presidential election)  There is a nationwide Republican scheme to rig the next Presidential election by playing with the system of the Electoral College.  19 February 2013 (Control over world market for seeds)  GMO seeds have boosted 3 companies to control over half the world market for seeds. When they sell seeds, they demand farmers meet excruciating condition in addition to not saving the seeds.  This for seeds that soon won't give any particular benefit since superweeds have evolved to neutralize their benefits.  19 February 2013 (Arctic sea ice thickness)  Taking thickness into account, Arctic sea ice in summer is just 1/5 what it was in 1980.  It follows that the ice will soon be gone in summer, and since liquid water absorbs a lot more light than ice, the Arctic will heat up even faster.  19 February 2013 (High price of quinoa)  The high price of quinoa means the indigenous growers get more money, while other indigenous that want to eat it can't afford to. But, beyond that, it has led to a massification of production that undermines ecosystems.  19 February 2013 (More on how Japan can boost economy by supporting the people)  More about how Japan can borrow lots of money at low interest from the Japanese people, and how paying the interest on this debt effectively boosts the economy by supporting the people.  19 February 2013 (Kashmir on total lockdown)  Kashmir is totally locked down. People are not allowed to travel.  Local newspapers, TV news and mobile Internet access are shut down.  For decades now, a special law allows Indian soldiers to kill with impunity in Kashmir.  India promised Kashmiris a referendum so they could decide whether to be in India or not. But it has never allowed the referendum to be held.  Indian rule of Kashmir is oppression. Being part of Pakistan would be oppressive too (as it is for everyone there). Imposing Islamic law would oppress all women (and sometimes men). Is there a path for Kashmir that avoids oppression?  19 February 2013 (Dissidents in Oman on hunger strike)  Imprisoned dissidents in Oman are on hunger strike.  19 February 2013 (Israel's targeting of journalists in Gaza)  Israel gives bogus answers when the Committee to Protect Journalists asks why Israel targeted journalists in Gaza.  19 February 2013 (Company at center of horsemeat scandal)  A company at the center of the horsemeat scandal is controlled by multiple levels of front company, and the real owner cannot be determined.  19 February 2013 (Public school closures)  Corporations Advise School Closings, While Private Charters Suck Public Schools Away  Many US charter schools assure their "success" by selectively admitting students who won't cost them much.  19 February 2013 (UK thug official arrested for giving out confidential information)  A UK thug official in charge of a borough was arrested for giving confidential information to journalists.  It is interesting to contrast this case with those of whistleblowers such as Bradley Manning and Daniel Ellsberg. They revealed grave government misdeeds that were being covered up. This and other recently arrested UK thugs gave information about private individuals, some of whom were being investigated, and others were not. That means there was no such public right to know in these cases.  19 February 2013 (Urgent: Oppose CISPA)  US citizens: oppose CISPA.  The CISPA bill was reintroduced, even though Obama did the job without trashing Americans' privacy.  19 February 2013 (Urgent: Stop unconstitutional drone killings)  US citizens: tell your elected officials, no more unconstitutional drone killings.  19 February 2013 (Facebook's multi-billion dollar tax break)  Facebook's Multi-Billion Dollar Tax Break.  19 February 2013 (Women in Tahrir Square)  The battle to keep women in Tahrir Square.  19 February 2013 (The Great Wealth Robbery)  The Great Wealth Robbery.  19 February 2013 (Misconceptions about copyright monopoly)  Basic misconceptions about the copyright monopoly.  See also Misinterpreting Copyright&nbsp;&mdash; A Series of Errors for fallacies in thinking about copyright policy.  19 February 2013 (Obama wants to have companies informally censor Internet)  Obama wants to kick radical views off the Internet, but to avoid passing unconstitutional laws banning radical views, he will have companies informally censor them.  19 February 2013 (Nikon stops selling parts to independent repair stores)  Nikon has stopped selling parts to independent camera repair stores.  19 February 2013 (Sri Lankan gov't manipulates social media)  The government of Sri Lanka cleverly manipulates social media, while threatening dissidents secretly to hush them up.  19 February 2013 (Evidence that lies to justify war were sought in advance)  Evidence now shows that the lies Dubya used to justify the conquest of Iraq were deliberately sought in advance.  19 February 2013 (Effect of London court ruling on free speech)  London court ruling could have grave consequences for free speech online.  19 February 2013 (Alameda County Sheriff wants to buy a drone)  The Alameda County Sheriff wants to buy a drone and have no real limits on its use for surveillance.  To make it ok, he will avoid using the word "surveillance" to describe what he wants to do with it.  19 February 2013 (Urgent: Raise the minimum wage)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and say, raise the minimum wage. Also send a message through this web page.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  17 February 2013 (Put Shah Khamenei to the test)  Shah Khamenei said once again that he does not aim for Iran to have nuclear weapons.  There is evidence that the IAEA has been politicized by its current head, so the dispute between Iran and IAEA may be just an excuse to pressure Iran. On the other hand, I see no reason to trust the word of Shah Khamenei, who presides over a tyranny that threatens the relatives of dissidents until they lie.  However, it would be rational to put him to the test. If the US offered an end to sanctions in exchange for a deal on enrichment, would he accept it?  17 February 2013 (Proposed bill to tax large carbon emitters)  Senators Sanders and Boxer propose a bill to tax large carbon emitters and end subsidies.  17 February 2013 (Horsemeat and fish quotas)  Europe does things badly when 27 governments have to negotiate a common policy.  17 February 2013 (Elizabeth Warren's first hearing)  Elizabeth Warren Embarrasses Hapless Bank Regulators At First Hearing.  17 February 2013 (Intolerant, violent Salafis)  Intolerant, violent Salafis cause problems for everyone in new Arab democracies.  17 February 2013 (Bisphenol A comes with bad eating)  The correlation of Bisphenol A with medical problems may be coincidence: Bisphenol A comes with bad eating.  17 February 2013 (Prisoners held in secret CIA prisons missing)  Twenty prisoners held in secret CIA prisons cannot be accounted for.  17 February 2013 (Militarization of thugs)  From Dorner to Waco to MOVE Bombing, A Look at Growing Militarization of Domestic Policing. And why the use of pyrotechnic weapons against Dorner was clearly wrong.  17 February 2013 (Republicans want every state to be like Mississippi)  Republicans plan to make every state in the US like Mississippi.  17 February 2013 (Florida schoolchildren arrested in school)  Over 12,000 Florida schoolchildren were arrested in school, mostly for minor things such as violating a dress code.  17 February 2013 (Violent thugs in British Colombia)  Thugs in British Colombia have a pattern of violence against indigenous women.  17 February 2013 (Call on Iran to free former presidential candidates)  Human rights organizations call on Iran to free former presidential candidates.  17 February 2013 (Internet dissidents imprisoned in Vietnam)  Vietnam has imprisoned 30 Internet dissidents.  17 February 2013 (Protecting debtors in Spain from eviction)  Public pressure made the right-wing Spanish government protect debtors from eviction.  17 February 2013 (CO2 from thawing Arctic permafrost)  Thawing permafrost in the Arctic is contributing more CO2 to the air than was previously thought. This means we are closer to disaster than was previously thought.  Global heating is starting to create conflicts, and the world is not thinking about how bad that will get in a few decades.  17 February 2013 (What happens when minimum wage is raised)  What Actually Happens When You Raise the Minimum Wage.  17 February 2013 (Violations of attorney-client privilege at Guantanamo)  Guantanamo defense lawyers charge that their meetings with their clients are being spied on.  For many reasons, these trials are nothing like justice.  17 February 2013 (Using drones for criminal investigation in the US)  A bill would require a court order to use a drone for a criminal investigation in the US.  17 February 2013 (How Japan can sustain national debt)  Ellen Brown explains how Japan can easily sustain a national debt of twice its GDP without collapsing: it borrows from the Japanese people through a state-owned bank.  17 February 2013 (Bill Gates backs crop research in Mexico)  Bill Gates is backing crop research in Mexico, and it may include GMOs.  Will farmers be free to use and breed these crops? It is not clear.  17 February 2013 (New space telescope to detect dangerous asteroids)  A new space telescope, not government-funded, will detect the small asteroids that could produce substantial disasters if they hit Earth.  17 February 2013 (Atrocities committed by US soldiers in Vietnam)  Secret US Army investigation files prove that US soldiers in Vietnam regularly committed atrocities, with their commanders' approval and even under their orders.  Officers told men to kill prisoners (often civilians) so as to increase the body count.  17 February 2013 (Companies recruiting environmentalists to praise GMOs)  Biotech and pesticide companies have a plan to make the public like GMOs by recruiting known environmentalists (not necessarily experts in this field) to praise them. And they may be doing it.  I am not necessarily against GMO foods in all circumstances, but their safety for humans and the environment must be verified by a skeptical government (few and far between, nowadays), and they must respect farmers' rights to breed their plants and animals.  17 February 2013 (Birgitta J&oacute;nsd&oacute;ttir campaigns against Internet filtering)  Birgitta J&oacute;nsd&oacute;ttir campaigns against Internet filtering in Iceland.  17 February 2013 (UK health service whistleblower)  UK health service whistleblower claims he was forced to quit then gagged.  17 February 2013 (Lowered air fares)  Did airline deregulation lower air fares? It is not clear.  17 February 2013 (Politicians bought and destroyed by Koch brothers)  The Koch brothers' history of buying and destroying politicians, so as to escape from a series of criminal charges.  17 February 2013 ("Six strikes" will harm open wireless)  Don't Be Fooled: "Six Strikes" Will Undoubtedly Harm Open Wireless.  17 February 2013 (Foreign threat boosts Iranians' support for their lousy gov't)  Iranians mostly blame the West for sanctions, not their own government, and mostly want to continue uranium refining.  There's nothing like a foreign threat to boost popular support for a lousy government.  17 February 2013 (Leaked memo about drone assassinations)  The leaking of a memo about drone assassinations invigorated Senate oversight of the issue.  17 February 2013 (Senator Rand Paul to block Brennan's nomination)  Senator Rand Paul will block Brennan's nomination until he gives a straight answer to whether the CIA has the authority to kill Americans in America without a trial.  He is doing the right thing. I wish some Democrats did it too, so that we would not depend on Republicans for this. And I wish the senate had not voted to allow imprisonment without trial, too.  17 February 2013 (Reuters correspondent describes drone attack)  Reuters correspondent David Rohde was almost hit by a drone missile while a prisoner of the Taliban. He says, "Just the force and size of the explosion amazed me. It comes with no warning and tremendous force It's a serious military action."  Drones must be treated like artillery, and used only on battlefields.  17 February 2013 (Canada treats environmentalists as terrorists)  Canada systematically treats environmentalists as terrorists and calls their protests attacks on nationals security.  17 February 2013 (Thugs that boast of killing)  A gang of thugs within the L.A. Sheriff's department boasted of killings.  The victims may well have deserved to be put in prison. It is even possible that shooting some of them was justified. However, thugs that boast of killing are a bigger threat.  17 February 2013 (Turkey's prime minister)  Turkey's principal opposition leader says Prime Minister Erdogan wants the power of a dictator.  17 February 2013 (Gov't of India allowing forests to be cut down without review)  The government of India has decided to let "major infrastructure projects" cut down forests without review.  In effect, it is a free pass for mines to destroy the environment and take people's land. The victims will have no defense except to join the Naxalite rebels.  17 February 2013 (Urgent: Publication of proposed "TransPacific Partnership" treaty)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and say, Please insist that Obama publish the text of the "TransPacific Partnership", a dangerous proposed free exploitation treaty.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  17 February 2013 (Urgent: Support the Access to Birth Control act)  US citizens: tell your senators to support the Access to Birth Control act.  17 February 2013 (President Correa made life better for the poor)  How President Correa made life better for Ecuador's poor, by rejecting the advice of other economists.  He even got debts cancelled because they were invalidly contracted. I expect many governments, betraying the people, imposed debt on their countries illegitimately. Maybe they only need courage to get some of those debts cancelled.  I have posted criticisms of some of Correa's policies, but we should not forget that those are the exceptions.  17 February 2013 (Firebombing of Dresden)  Victor Gregg, who witnessed as a prisoner the firebombing of Dresden, insists it was a giant war crime.  17 February 2013 (Singapore plans to increase population)  Crowded Singapore plans to increase its population by 30%, and natives fear loss of jobs.  It makes sense for Singapore to accept immigrants &mdash; that is much better than encouraging births &mdash; but Singapore should help workers get better pay, and subsidize adequate housing for all.  17 February 2013 (Politicizing casualty estimates for Syrian civil war)  Beware of simplifying and politicizing casualty estimates for the Syrian civil war.  Among civilian casualties, we can expect that roughly half are female and half are male. 7.5% of the recorded casualties are female. If all females are civilians, 7.5% of the casualties are female civilians. That suggests male civilians are also roughly 7.5%, so that roughly 15% of the casualties are civilians.  There is evidence of massacres of civilians, and war zones are not safe places in any case. But this suggests that the fighters on both sides are mostly fighting each other, not massacring civilians.  17 February 2013 (Global heating denial campaigns)  Anonymous billionaires fund "grass-roots" media campaign organizations, with misleading names, that oppose renewable energy efforts and deny global heating.  17 February 2013 (Obama uses his skin color to deflect criticism)  Obama uses his skin color to shield his right-wing positions from the criticism they deserve.  17 February 2013 (Iceland to impose filtering on Internet)  Iceland is moving to impose filtering on the Internet, on the absurd pretext that pornography "hurts women". In effect, equating "possibly offends" with "hurts".  Censorship hurts men and women alike.  17 February 2013 (Regulation of commercial messages)  "Freedom doesn't simply mean letting it all hang out".  The common thread for these annoyances (not counting Sun page 3, which, as pointed out, nobody has to look at) is that business imposes its commercial messages on public space. To regulate this is not censorship of people's freedom of speech. The UK must show more respect for people's freedom of speech, but at the same time it could could regulate these commercial messages.  Instead it fails to enforce existing requirements. Why? Because government kowtows to business. It desperately sells ads to business because it doesn't have the courage to tax business enough.  17 February 2013 (Reptile species face extinction)  1/5 of reptile species face extinction.  If we keep increasing our population and the atmosphere's CO2 concentration, we will wipe out half of them or more.  17 February 2013 (Protests against invasion of Iraq 10 years ago)  Giant protests 10 years ago failed to stop the invasion of Iraq, but set the stage for condemning it afterward.  17 February 2013 (Senate Republicans block vote on Hagel's nomination)  Senate Republicans blocked a vote on Hagel's nomination, demanding Obama give them more information about the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.  The worst things that are likely to be revealed by more information are possible mistakes and confusion. Thus, they are not really very important; Republicans are making a mountain out of a molehill. But it can't hurt to scrutinize them, so Obama ought to hand the information over.  17 February 2013 (Company accused of passing off horsemeat as beef)  A specific meat company has been accused of passing off horsemeat as beef.  It is proper to prosecute the companies that lied; I hope they are not too big to prosecute. However, the real problem is a system that has a tremendous number of points of vulnerability, and weak inspections to try to catch them.  17 February 2013 (Brooklyn College President stands firm for academic freedom)  Brooklyn College President Karen Gould's letter standing firm for academic freedom, including criticism of Israeli policy.  17 February 2013 (Woman accused of killing by magic burnt to death)  Deadly superstition: a woman accused of killing by magic was burnt to death by a crowd in Papua New Guinea.  17 February 2013 (Urgent: Cut military budget before Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare)  US citizens: call for cutting the military budget before Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare.  Here's the message I sent.  As Keynes taught and FDR demonstrated, ending a recession calls for deficit spending: to cut the deficit now is going in the wrong direction. But it would be even worse to cut the deficit by cutting spending that efficiently benefits the people, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. If you cannot prevent cuts, cut the spending that is unnecessary and that makes the fewest jobs per dollar: military spending.   17 February 2013 (Urgent: Fix holes in Keystone XL pipeline)  US citizens: sign this petition calling on the company building the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline to fix the holes first.  17 February 2013 (Anti-anxiety drug oxazepam getting into rivers)  The anti-anxiety drug oxazepam gets into rivers in tiny quantities, but even those tiny quantities make some small fish so insouciant that they are likely to get eaten.  17 February 2013 (Desperate man sets self on fire in Italy)  A desperate man, illegally in Italy, set himself on fire.  Can anyone find out why he thought deportation back to Ivory Coast was worse than death?  17 February 2013 (A chance to restrain the CIA's violence)  Ben Emmerson, UN rapporteur for human rights and counterterrorism, says he thinks that Brennan could offer Obama a chance to restrain the CIA's violence.  Reportedly Brennan wants the CIA to transfer all drone assassinations to the military.  This makes sense in principle, since the only legitimate context for drone bombers is a battlefield, and CIA drone operators that kill could be accused of being "illegal combatants", which the Bush regime says is grounds to put someone in prison.  However, according to the second link above, the US military is running out of control too.  17 February 2013 (Global heating puts US gov't at risk)  The US government is failing to protect itself from global heating, which endangers its property and causes financial exposure.  17 February 2013 (Pleading guilty when too poor to make bail)  Poor defendants in the US often plead guilty because they can't make bail and are jailed (for months) until trial.  17 February 2013 (Bahraini suppression forces attack protesters)  Bahraini suppression forces attacked protesters, and killed a teenager with shotgun fire.  17 February 2013 (Iceland's refusal to bail out risking banking)  Iceland's refusal to bail out risky banking has been vindicated.  17 February 2013 (Euro-austerity recession affecting Germany)  The euro-austerity recession is starting to affect Germany.  The recession causes austerity, because of the euro zone's rule that limits deficit spending, and the austerity causes recession (as it always does). So far, the German government has blocked any way out of this. Recession in Germany might perhaps lead to the replacement of Merkel with someone who wants to fix this problem.  17 February 2013 (Burmese suppression forces attack protesters)  Burmese suppression forces attacked protesters with phosphorus shells. They were protesting a mine that causes environmental damage.  17 February 2013 (Chinese-funded fishing in Mozambique)  Chinese-funded fishing is wiping out the sharks and mantas from Mozambique's coast.  16 February 2013 (Urgent: Release of Senate report on CIA torture)  US citizens: call on the Senate to release its report on CIA torture.  16 February 2013 (Birgitta J&oacute;nsd&oacute;ttir's visit to the US)  More on the risk of Birgitta J&oacute;nsd&oacute;ttir's visit to the US.  16 February 2013 (UN's water agenda at risk of being hijacked)  UN's Water Agenda at Risk of Being Hijacked by Big Business.  16 February 2013 (Designation of new wilderness areas overdue)  The US National Park Service has dragged its feet on designating new wilderness areas. One plan is 29 years overdue.  16 February 2013 (Iran sanctions)  Obama, tell Iran that you'll end Iran sanctions as part of a satisfactory nuclear deal.  16 February 2013 (US food industry fights regulation)  US Food Industry Battles Against Regulation.  16 February 2013 (Obama regime tries to override truth with naked lies )  Obama's lawyers claim in court that the very existence of the CIA's assassination program is still a secret.  This might seem like irrational bullheadedness, but it is much worse than that. The Obama regime is attempting to override truth with naked lies. Remember when the Bushmen asserted they were more powerful than reality? That's what the Obombers are doing now.  16 February 2013 (Urgent: Call on Obama to take steps to curb global heating)  US citizens: call on Obama to take the specific steps needed to really implement his stated intention to curb global heating.  16 February 2013 (Thugs arrested for protecting drug dealers)  Thugs in Atlanta were arrested for protecting drug dealers.  This is one of many ways that the War on Drugs hurts all of us.  Some drugs are dangerous, but if you avoid taking them, they can't hurt you. You can't avoid the danger of the War on Drugs.  16 February 2013 (Former LA thug confirms report of bigotry in LA thug dept.)  Former LA thug Brian Bentley says that the bigotry reported by Dorner is standard practice in the LA thug department.  The LA thug department still acts like an occupation force, and that is what Dorner reacted to.  16 February 2013 (Law to allow sneaking surveillance software into people's computers)  Canada is considering a law to allow companies to sneak surveillance software into people's computers.  16 February 2013 (US schools persecuting "weird" kids)  The irrational response of US schools to school shooters is to persecute anyone who responds with weirdness to the oppression of school.  16 February 2013 (Movie companies bully and bribe New Zealand)  Movie companies bullied and bribed New Zealand into union-busting. An official has ordered publication of pertinent documents, so movie companies threaten not to do business with New Zealand again unless the state somehow prevents this.  The proper response to those companies is, "Good riddance to you!"  16 February 2013 (Mexican teenager shot at US border)  The US border patrol appears to have shot a Mexican teenager (across the border fence) in the back 11 times, as he was lying on his belly.  Agents say he was throwing rocks at them, but the terrain suggests he could not possibly have been doing so.  16 February 2013 (Publisher sues university librarian)  A Canadian publisher has sued a university librarian who said its books are generally not very good.  16 February 2013 (Political failure mode)  Has democracy fallen into a strange attractor where no change is possible?  15 February 2013 (Money funneled to global heating denialists)  Anonymous donors funnel money to numerous global heating denialists, including the Heatland Institute.  15 February 2013 (Google countersues BT over patents)  Google countersues BT over patents.  This useful article has a flaw that could have been easily avoided: it uses the term "intellectual property", which confuses patents with a dozen other disparate and unrelated laws. That term should never be used. See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html.  Florian M&uuml;ller's question is answered in the article itself: Google isn't a non-practicing entity (aka patent troll), and generally has been the victim rather than the aggressor in patent battles.  However, the crucial point about software patents is not who is suing whom. It's that they should not exist at all. It is lunacy to issue patents that restrict software. http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/richard-stallman-software-patents/ explains a way to correct this problem.  The EU's unitary patent scheme is an indirect way of authorizing software patents. See unitary-patent.eu for more information about the danger of this scheme.  15 February 2013 (Defense lawyer says Prisoner X was innocent of charges)  The defense lawyer for Israel's Prisoner X says that he said he was innocent of undisclosed charges against him, and may have committed suicide because of the pressure of the interrogation.  I suspect that his interrogators aimed for that result. If it was so important to silence him, what way better than death?  15 February 2013 (Companies that tried and failed tax avoidance in UK)  Companies that tried to use failed tax avoidance schemes will be banned from UK government contracts.  That is how it should be, but what about the tax avoidance schemes that have not yet failed?  15 February 2013 (Mexico says rapists have confessed)  Mexico says a gang of rapists have confessed, but are they the culprits?  The possibility of forcing the "usual suspects" to confess is quite real. Recall the two UK women who championed the case of the man who was falsely convicted in Jamaica of raping them &mdash; they said all along he was the wrong man.  15 February 2013 (LA thugs say tear gas canisters accidentally started fire)  LA thugs say their tear gas canisters accidentally started the fire that burned down the house Dorner was staying in. However, burning the house was a predictable result of using weapons that catch fire.  15 February 2013 (UK horsemeat scandal)  The UK government invited a scandal like the current horsemeat "beef" scandal, by cutting back on food inspections.  14 February 2013 (UK gov't to abolish confidentiality of whistleblowers)  The UK government plans to abolish confidentiality of whistleblowers that talk to reporters.  14 February 2013 (Italian spy official sentenced to prison)  An Italian spy official has been sentenced to prison for helping a CIA kidnaping.  14 February 2013 (Operating drones makes CIA unlawful combatant)  The US prosecutes "unlawful combatants", but when the CIA operates drones, it is also an unlawful combatant.  14 February 2013 (NRA lobbies to weaken Arms Trade Treaty)  The NRA is lobbying to weaken the Arms Trade Treaty even though that treaty would have no effect on Americans' right to own guns.  The NRA has been called a lobbyist for gun manufacturers, and this campaign supports that claim.  14 February 2013 (Food shortage)  The world is entering an era of food shortage, squeezed between global heating and population growth.  We need to reduce both global heating and population growth.  14 February 2013 (Obama's cyber-security order)  Obama's cyber-security order avoids the privacy threats of CISPA, but there is still a possibility for harm when the details are worked out.  14 February 2013 (Charges dropped against many Occupy Boston protesters)  Charges were dropped against many Occupy Boston protesters, who had been strung along for over a year.  14 February 2013 (Urgent: Protect EPA's authority to limit global heating)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and say, protect the EPA's authority to limit global heating. Also sign this petition.  While you're at it, you can say something stronger as well.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  14 February 2013 (Obama's reported choice for Secretary of Commerce)  Obama's reported choice for Secretary of Commerce is a predatory bankster.  14 February 2013 (Drone assassination of US citizens in the US)  Brennan, when pressed, refused to rule out using drones to assassinate US citizens in the US.  14 February 2013 (Imprisonment of protesters and dissidents in Bahrain)  Bahrain's regime continues to imprison protesters and dissidents.  14 February 2013 (Phony cell phone tower Stingray)  The Stingray phony cell phone tower is designed to do exactly what the Fourth Amendment was designed to prohibit.  13 February 2013 (Israel's airstrikes in November)  Human Rights Watch reports 18 Israeli airstrikes in November that seem to have been war crimes.  13 February 2013 (Secret courts will let UK security services off the hook)  Secret courts will let UK security services off the hook for horrible wrongs.  13 February 2013 (Portable iris scanner)  A new surveillance threat: a portable iris scanner that works from a meter away.  If thousands of soldiers will have them, they surely won't be the only ones to have them. They will be tracking everyone, everywhere.  13 February 2013 (Secret imprisonment and death of man linked to Israel's spy agency)  A man with links to Israel's spy agency was imprisoned secretly in Israel. And he is said to have killed himself in prison, despite being watched to prevent suicide.  13 February 2013 (Protests against sale of plant products from Israeli colonies)  Protests around Europe aimed at ending the sales of plant products grown in Israeli colonies in Palestine.  Here's an example of what the inhabitants of these colonies do to Palestinians that live near them.  13 February 2013 (Israeli soldiers attack Palestinians with impunity)  Israeli soldiers attack Palestinians with total impunity: of 105 soldiers that were investigated in 2012, Israel indicted 0 of them.  13 February 2013 (Urgent: Support gun control measures)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter to support gun control measures: requiring background checks and banning large magazines. Also sign this petition.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  13 February 2013 (Saudi princes demand secrecy in UK court)  Saudi princes demand secrecy in a UK court, threatening to punish the state if it publishes corruption accusations.  13 February 2013 (Former Maldives president takes refuge)  The only elected president of the Maldive islands has taken refuge in the Indian embassy.  13 February 2013 (Battle for abortion rights in Hispanic America)  The battle for abortion rights in Hispanic America is making very slow progress, with many women as casualties.  13 February 2013 (Two large US airlines to merge)  It looks like two large US airlines will merge.  It happens regularly in the US that large competitors merge, creating a company that is the largest in their field. The smallest competitor tends to find this difficult, so it proposes another merger, and the cycle leads to ever fewer competitors.  The state should ban mergers of companies that together have more than 5% of any market.  13 February 2013 (Philippines govt negotiating autonomous zone for Muslims)  The Philippines government is negotiating an autonomous zone for Muslims in Mindanao.  Autonomy for a region might be a good outcome, but it must not be an excuse for Islamic law that tramples human rights. The autonomous region should have to promise to respect religious freedom, including the freedom to stop being a Muslim, as well as women's legal equality.  13 February 2013 (Urgent: Support Grayson-Takano letter)  US citizens: call on your congresscritter to support the Grayson-Takano letter, which commits to opposing any bill that cuts Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security.  Also affirm your support for it. (This shows the letter itself too.)  13 February 2013 (Obama pushes for more "free trade")  Obama is pushing more of the "free trade" poison that has already done so much to hurt working people.  13 February 2013 (Homosexuals' right to marry)  It is good that homosexuals have the right to marry, but must they (and heterosexuals) force themselves into the mold of heterosexual tradition?  13 February 2013 (Obama's strong words about curbing global heating)  Obama gave strong words about curbing global heating.  It's a good start, but what's needed now is action. Does he have the courage to cancel the planet roaster pipeline?  13 February 2013 (Evidence that LA Thug Department deliberately started fire)  There is evidence that the LA Thug Department deliberately started a fire that killed renegade ex-thug Chris Dorner.  Some are calling Dorner a hero. I don't think so.  Dorner was fired from his job as a thug because he reported that his partner had kicked a homeless person. The partner denied it, but since attacking the weak and lying about it is a common thug behavior pattern, I find the accusation plausible. If the accusation was true, Dorner was fired for whistleblowing, and he could be considered to have been a hero at that point.  However, his rancor subsequently developed into a murderous hatred, directed against people who were merely related to those involved, which we can only call madness. Killing someone for revenge is wrong; killing someone's children for revenge is wrong squared.  13 February 2013 (Chile asks US to extradite accused assassin)  Chile has asked the US to extradite the accused assassin of protest singer Victor Jara.  13 February 2013 (Urgent: Oppose building road through wilderness in Alaska)  US citizens: call on the Secretary of the Interior to resist building a road through wilderness in Alaska.  13 February 2013 (Deported Sri Lankans return to UK, show evidence of torture)  Of the Sri Lankans denied asylum in the UK, and deported to Sri Lanka, 15 later got back to Britain and demonstrated they had been tortured.  13 February 2013 (Companies try to weaken laws on data protection)  The European Parliament is drafting law on data protection with text from the companies it should be protecting citizens against.  These companies are trying to weaken existing protection, not just prevent stronger protection.  13 February 2013 (Main issue in UK horsemeat scandal)  The main issue in the UK horsemeat scandal is that animals not raised for human consumption are getting into the food. They might even have been sick.  13 February 2013 (Campaign in China against eating shark fin)  A campaign in China against eating shark fin is reducing sales.  The ironic thing about shark fin is that there's no real reason for anyone to eat it. It has little taste; it has a distinctive feel, but it is hardly a special delight. The point of shark's fin soup is only to show the guests at your banquet that you spent enough to serve shark's fin soup. Anything else that is rare would do the same job.  13 February 2013 (Cambodia bans lawyers from talking to reporters)  Cambodia has banned lawyers from giving media interviews.  Obama has also started a crackdown on talking to reporters.  13 February 2013 (EU negotiator working on more free exploitation treaties)  An EU negotiator who tried to defy parliament over ACTA is working on other free exploitation treaties  that might repeat the same oppression.  13 February 2013 (Teenage pregnancy) What the war on women means for pregnant teenagers. Many states require parental approval for a teenager to get an abortion. I have never understood the rationale for this. Giving birth is more dangerous than an abortion, and raising a baby is much harder than not having one. So if we think that there is something in the aftermath of pregnancy for which teenagers should need parental permission, it would not be abortion, it would be having the baby.   13 February 2013 (Yemen's investigation of massacre)  Yemen's investigation of a massacre of protesters turned into a whitewash of the government.   13 February 2013 (Blowback from CIA's intensified drone attacks)  The CIA intensified its drone bombings in Pakistan in January 2013, and  the Taliban retaliated against the Pakistan's army.   The civilian casualties are the Taliban's fault. Islamist extremists in Pakistan, as elsewhere, are guilty of monstrous violence, and I think Pakistanis are starting to recognize this and condemn the Taliban. But this has a long way to go.  13 February 2013 (Japan using deficit spending to re-engage economy)  Japan is rejecting the plutocratic opposition to deficits and using deficit spending to re-engage the economy.  13 February 2013 (Treatment of veterans)  A man who says he killed Osama bin Laden complains about the lousy treatment he got when he left the Navy. This man boasts about shooting killing a suspected criminal who was unarmed, and should have been captured and put on trial. He admits no shame for this wrong &mdash; indeed, he says we ought to admire him. As others point out, the problems he encounters are not unusual. Lots of US veterans have similar problems &mdash; and that's the real issue here. Where he criticizes treating the person who shot bin Laden so badly, I say veterans in general deserve better treatment, and that even applies to him.   13 February 2013 (Barclays Bank)  Barclays Bank will close its tax avoidance guide division, whose services helped large businesses move billions of dollars in profits so that they would not be taxed. Even if Barclays sincerely refuses to facilitate business tax-avoidance from now on, that won't stop it. Many now know how the tricks are done, and if one bank doesn't do them, another will. To really address this problem requires changing tax laws so that these tricks don't work any more.  13 February 2013 (US pressures ICRC not to give abortions to women raped in war)  In many wars, soldiers rape women as a tactic of war, but the US has pressured the  ICRC not to give them abortions.  13 February 2013 (Americans' concerns about casualties from military operations)  A study found Americans are concerned about a likelihood of civilian casualties from a military operation, just as they are concerned about a likelihood of US military casualties.  How much this concern expresses itself in practice will depend on how the issue is framed and how the choices are presented. Deceptive language, such as labeling all adult men that aren't elderly as "combatants", can fool people.  12 February 2013 (NY school bus drivers on strike)  New York school bus drivers are on strike because they face getting replaced by non-union drivers  who would be paid even less.   12 February 2013 (Journals)  The concept of "high impact" journals, which helps publishers keep restrictive journals going,  is bad for science in other ways.   12 February 2013 (St Patrick's Day parade in Boston)  Boston has a parade on St Patrick's Day, to please the Irish-Americans, but lets a right-wing veterans group run it. So there is an alternative parade on the same day, for the groups  excluded from the main parade. I doubt I'd want to march for a Catholic saint, but if you feel like doing that, you could join the alternative one.  12 February 2013 (Planning Assad's exit)  One of Assad's ministers is proposing talks with the rebels based on  planning Assad's exit from government.  12 February 2013 (Wikileaks) Birgitta J&oacute;nsd&oacute;ttir will visit the US despite the danger she will be  prosecuted over Wikileaks.  12 February 2013 (Bhutan to ban artificial fertilizers and pesticides)  Bhutan plans to ban artificial fertilizers and pesticides. Ironically, global heating may interfere with the plan.  To live in harmony with nature has one more requirement: keep the population down. Nature can absorb most kinds of waste, in limited quantities.  12 February 2013 (Islamists invade Gao)  Islamists invaded Gao and fought with Malian and French forces.  12 February 2013 (Criminalizing "insults" in Iraqi Kurdistan)  Iraqi Kurdistan (effectively autonomous from the Iraqi state) imprisons opposition leaders, and prosecutes journalists for political and religious leaders.  The freedom to insult someone powerful is a central part of freedom of speech.  12 February 2013 (Urgent: Support the International Day for Privacy)  Everyone: support the International Day for Privacy on Feb 23.  12 February 2013 (Censorship in US libraries)  Imposing Internet filters on US libraries turns them into agents of censorship.  I don't entirely agree with the response that compares filters with abortion, because that is unfair to abortion. Ideally no women would have unwanted pregnancies and therefore none would ever want an abortion; however, having an abortion imposes less burden on the world than having a baby, which creates a reason for encouraging abortions. One should be a lot more negative towards Internet filtering.  12 February 2013 (Brain injuries sustained by US soldiers)  250,000 US soldiers have had brain injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan.  12 February 2013 (Study modeling random gun attacks)  A study modeling random gun attacks together with using guns to kill attackers finds that an armed public is an effective defense against shooters (as the NRA proclaims) if there is a ban on large magazines. And even then, it is valid only when shooters attack a large crowd.  If the NRA really wants everyone to carry a pistol, it ought rationally to support the assault weapon ban so that its argument becomes at least partly valid. But it still may not be valid enough, since most shooters don't attack large crowds.  12 February 2013 (Elton John strikes raw nerve in China's rulers)  Elton John struck a raw nerve in China's rulers by praising persecuted artist Ai Weiwei.  They now appeal to a perverted idea that musicians' honor requires being apolitical.  12 February 2013 (Tax rules biased in favor of businesses)  What UK companies are doing to avoid tax.  It is possible these tax rules are biased against poor countries in some way, but their biggest problem is that they are biased against all countries, and in favor of businesses.  No state should wait for agreement on changing these rules. Any country that unilaterally breaks with them will be doing itself a favor.  12 February 2013 (Possible Arab democracy threatened)  Violent Islamist extremism threatens possible Arab democracy.  12 February 2013 (Iraq's intersectarian war)  Iraq's slow intersectarian war churns on, with over 4500 killed in 2012 (often civilians).  11 February 2013 (Bottom-trawling leaves seas barren)  Indiscriminate bottom-trawling scours the seas and leaves them barren. There is better way, which involves stewardship of the sea bottom.  Bottom-trawling maximizes the efficiency of extraction, the amount of seafood that can be taken with a given amount of work. It may have also increased the total catch, when that was limited by human capacity to collect it.  Now the total catch is limited by ecological factors, so more efficient fishing just means less human employment in getting the same catch. Society is beset by unemployment, so what we want now is for fishing to employ more people. Thus, banning bottom-trawling makes does good in two ways.  11 February 2013 (Raytheon's "Riot" program tracks everyone)  Raytheon's "Riot" program tracks everyone through social networks &mdash; just the thing to find dissidents or protesters and pre-emptively attack them.  It won't find out much about me, because I don't give information to these sites. When people take photos of me, I ask them to delete the geolocation data from them. I have now decided to also ask them to change the dates.  11 February 2013 (Tax avoidance by company that owns Twinings Tea)  The company that owns Twinings Tea practices tax avoidance in Zambia, starving that country of revenue.  11 February 2013 (Egypt bans YouTube)  YouTube has been banned in Egypt as an act of religion-based censorship.  11 February 2013 (India executes professor)  India executed a professor for supposedly leading an armed attack on Parliament, after a joke of a trial based on contradictory evidence.  11 February 2013 (Arson attack on Israeli soccer team)  An Israeli soccer team that signed up two Muslim players suffered an arson attack.  11 February 2013 (Environment and life of the high seas)  The environment and life of the high seas require protection from human activity.  11 February 2013 (Why US Internet connections are slow)  US Internet connections are slow and expensive because there is no competition. The few companies that exist have divided up the market.  An even worse consequence of the paucity of US ISPs is that Obama was able to get them to punish their users on behalf of the copyright companies.  Real network neutrality does not include an exception for usage some ISP decides to consider illegal. Only a court can decide that an internaut's actions are illegal.  The lack of competition in US Internet is an example of the domination of the US government by business. There are examples in all areas of life that businesses are concerned in. The absurd adoration of the market is not a random phenomenon; it is promoted by corporate PR because it increases the base level of business power over government.  11 February 2013 (Urgent: Ask weather presenters to talk about global heating)  In the US Northeast: petition weather presenters to explain the role of global heating in the blizzard.  Also call local weather presenters and ask them to do this.  11 February 2013 (Blizzard in US Northeast)  The big blizzard in the US Northeast was made bigger by global heating.  11 February 2013 (Factory farming: big contributor to global heating)  Factory farming is a big contributor to global heating.  11 February 2013 (Nigerian thugs shoot hundreds of people every year)  Nigerian thugs shoot hundreds of people every year, and the victims often don't get identified, let alone medical examination.  11 February 2013 (Pope Pius XII)  Pope Pius XII, criticized for not opposing the rise of Nazism, seems to have secretly organized efforts to save Jews from being massacred.  The Catholic Church was prejudiced against believers in Judaism: Jews who converted became ok as far as they were concerned. Hitler's antisemitism was based on descent: if you had a Jewish grandparent, he hated you regardless of your religion.  I read a book called The Rome Escape Line, by Sam Derry, which described how allied agents or soldiers &mdash; downed aviators, I think, but the memory is not clear &mdash; were hidden in the Vatican. Maybe Pius XII ordered that too.  11 February 2013 (Urgent: Boycott Hershey's and Dagoba chocolate)  US citizens: boycott Hershey's and Dagoba chocolate.  11 February 2013 (Urgent: Industrial hemp production)  US citizens: sign this petition in favor of industrial hemp production.  11 February 2013 (Coffee production in Guatemala being wiped out)  Global heating is wiping out coffee production in Guatemala.  11 February 2013 (Urgent: Support the Violence Against Women Act)  US citizens: support the Violence Against Women Act.  11 February 2013 (US bans distribution of Iranian TV channel)  The US banned distribution of the Iranian state English TV channel.  I suppose that channel is worse propaganda than the US mainstream media, but that still does not make it legitimate to censor.  11 February 2013 (Putin regime blocks access to journalistic blog site)  The Putin regime has blocked access to a journalistic blog site, with a ridiculous excuse of course.  11 February 2013 (Israeli soldiers destroy tent city)  Israeli soldiers destroyed a Palestinian tent city protesting plans to take more land.  11 February 2013 (Warrantless laptop searches)  The US Committee for Public Safety &mdash; no, make that Department of Homeland Security &mdash; has concluded that searching people's laptops at the border is perfectly legitimate, based on arguments it won't disclose.  11 February 2013 (Protest against TSA "security" searches in Boston subways)  A protest against TSA "security" searches in Boston subways.  I hope I can find out about the next one before it happens.  11 February 2013 (Forbidden topics in Washington)  In discussions in Washington, all the important US economic issues are ruled out.  11 February 2013 (Citizens of Seattle stop thugs from getting drones)  The Seattle thugs got set up to use drones, but citizens of Seattle reversed the decision.  11 February 2013 (No-fly list: arbitrary deprivation of rights)  Obama's arbitrary tyranny would not let Saadiq Long fly home to the US, but eventually relented so he could visit his sick mother. Then it surprised him by not letting him fly back to his job in Qatar.  The no-fly list is arbitrary deprivation of rights, and therefore inherently unjust.  11 February 2013 (Supreme Court to decide if farmers liable for patent infringement)  The Supreme Court will decide whether farmers are liable for patent infringement when they unknowingly plant seeds contaminated with patented genes.  If Monsanto wins, it will be nearly impossible to grow soybeans in the US and not be liable to Monsanto.  11 February 2013 (Hilary Clinton did many bad things as Secretary of State)  Hillary Clinton did a lot of very bad things as Secretary of State.  I might argue with a fraction of the points in the list, but that wouldn't change the conclusion. Remember this if she runs for president.  11 February 2013 (Urgent: Loophole-free regulation of commodities derivatives)  US citizens: call for thorough, loophole-free regulation of commodities derivatives.  10 February 2013 (Urgent: Women's access to contraception)  US citizens: support Obama's deal to give access to contraception to women employed in nonreligious jobs by church-linked organizations.  10 February 2013 (False DMCA takedowns)  Articles about scientific fraud were deleted after a obscure site plagiarized them, and sent false DMCA takedowns.  10 February 2013 (TEPCO lied to gov't)  TEPCO personnel lied to the government to dissuade the government from investigating damage in the Fukushima reactors.  10 February 2013 (Reports of Israeli attack, but no reliable information)  There were reports of an Israeli attack on Syrian anti-aircraft missiles being transported, but none of the information is reliable.  09 February 2013 (System of fraud put horsemeat in UK beef)  Horsemeat in UK beef turns out to be part of a large system of fraud. It can also be dangerous if the horses were given certain drugs.  09 February 2013 (Obama's Orwellian justification for drone bombings)  Obama's Orwellian justification for drone bombings makes assassination the first resort, effectively forever, against effectively anyone he can associate somehow with the al Qa'ida brand name.  09 February 2013 (Studies of medical treatment effects biased)  Studies of medical treatment effects are biased by not publishing unfavorable results. And laws meant to stop this have not been enforced.  09 February 2013 (Urgent: Increase minimum wage for workers that depend on tips)  US citizens: call for an increase in minimum wage for workers that now depend on tips.  09 February 2013 (EU budget cuts)  EU budget cuts will contribute to spreading recession in Europe.  Now is the time for deficit spending, not cuts.  09 February 2013 (UK's car-tracking system)  Thieves use false license plates to defeat the UK's system that tracks all car travel.  However, the system will work fine to track dissidents. UK dissidents don't think of breaking laws merely to keep their movements secret from the regime. Maybe they need to start.  09 February 2013 (Two camps of Malian soldiers)  Malian soldiers that support the new government fought Malian soldiers that support the pre-coup government.  09 February 2013 (DOE wants to recycle metal from nuclear sites)  The Department of Energy wants to recycle metal slightly contaminated with radioactivity. This means recycling it into metal used in everyday products.  I am concerned that in 50 years the US government will not have the capacity any longer to take proper care of nuclear sites. If global heating leads to disaster, with major coastal cities swamped, seas dead, and agriculture failing, will there be money and attention to spare for it?  09 February 2013 (US antibiotics mostly used in farm animals)  4/5 of US antibiotics use is in farm animals, and the systematic result is resistant bacteria.  09 February 2013 (The Constitution's human rights are not for corporations)  Why we must establish that all the Constitution's human rights are for people, not for corporations.  09 February 2013 (Most US gun deaths are suicides)  Most gun deaths in the US are suicides. Is this due to US plutocracy?  Then there are the Americans killed by their jobs, or by pollution.  Australia's experience suggests that a ban on assault rifles is likely to reduce murders, so it is worth doing, but the US government should not neglect its responsibilities to protect other aspects of people's well-being.  09 February 2013 (US law threatens EU citizens' privacy)  US law threatens EU citizens' privacy, study warns.  The article stretches the word "freedom" by applying it to "being able to access data from anywhere". "Being able" to do something is not freedom, it is convenience. People 70 years ago could not access digital data at all, but that did mean they lacked freedom. What they lacked was an aspect of convenience. Labeling convenience as freedom is a common fallacy. However, this doesn't undermine the point of the article.  The article also uses the term "cloud computing", which is so nebulous that in general it spreads confusion. Here it seems to mean "remote storage services".  09 February 2013 (Obama escalating War on Journalism)  Obama is escalating the War on Journalism: a massive US investigation is trying to find officials who have talked to reporters, then investigate their private email accounts.  09 February 2013 (Islamist fanatics kill polio vaccination workers)  Islamist fanatics in Nigeria killed polio vaccination workers.  If it is feasible for an intervention to suppress these child-cripplers long enough to vaccinate everyone (if not longer), I would support it.  09 February 2013 (The fundamental wrong of Obama's assassination system)  The fundamental wrong of Obama's assassination system is the idea that a terrorist attack constitutes war and that the proper response is war.  09 February 2013 (Brennan Senate hearing)  Brennan, interviewed by the Senate, says he was not responsible for torture policies or kidnapings. However, he defends the assassination program, saying US officials suffer "agony" in deciding whom to kill.  If they spoke to relatives of the victims they might find out what "agony" really means.  5 Questions John Brennan Dodged in His CIA Confirmation Hearing.  Waterboarding is not the only form of torture that the CIA used. It is the only one that Obama ordered the CIA to stop, so the others may continue. Did anyone ask Brennan whether chaining a person in a position that causes pain and bodily damage is torture?  09 February 2013 (Urgent: Make political advertisers say who really pays for ads)  US citizens: call on the FCC to make TV political advertisers say who really pays for the ads.  09 February 2013 (China arresting friends of protesters)  China has resorted to arresting the friends of protesters.  08 February 2013 (Secular opposition in Tunisia plans general strike)  Secular opposition in Tunisia plans a general strike after their leader was assassinated.  08 February 2013 (Indian women forced into prostitution in Arab countries)  Indian women who accept offers of domestic work in Arab countries are often effectively kidnaped and forced into prostitution there.  Perhaps it would help to set up a reporting system, where domestic workers gone abroad must contact someone at home once a month, or else will be presumed to have been enslaved and trigger a state investigation.  08 February 2013 (California's GMO labeling initiative)  The vote on California's GMO labeling initiative was close, and a local official blocked a recount by charging too much for it.  08 February 2013 (Urgent: Oppose cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid)  US citizens: sign this petition against cuts in Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.  08 February 2013 (Japanese "scientific whaling" boondoggle)  Japanese "scientific whaling" has done nothing for science, and they no longer sell the whale meat either, so it is an expensive harmful boondoggle.  08 February 2013 (Old manuscripts of Timbuktu saved by scholars)  Scholars hid and saved most of the old manuscripts of Timbuktu.  08 February 2013 (Urgent: Fire prosecutor Heymann)  US citizens: sign the petition to fire prosecutor Heymann (as well as prosecutor Ortiz).  08 February 2013 (36 days in jail for a human rights sign)  Saudi Arabia: 36 Days in Jail for a Human Rights Sign.  08 February 2013 (Prison sentence for "offending religious beliefs")  The Philippines follow where Russia leads: Carlos Celdran was sentenced to a year in prison for the crime of "offending religious beliefs".  08 February 2013 (Women in rock band receive rape threats and fatwa)  Young women in Kashmir who play in a rock band have received rape threats and a fatwa from oppressive Muslims.  08 February 2013 (Protesting sexual harassment in Tahrir Square)  Protesting sexual harassment in Tahrir Square.  Amnesty International comments on the issue.  08 February 2013 (Preventing extinction of polar bears)  Preventing the extinction polar bears may require drastic measures. Proposals include providing seals as food for some of them, and killing those that are too starved to survive.  If global heating were to stop in 15 years, we could continue doing this. However, in 50 years I think the effects of global heating on human society will be so devastating that no state will have money for this, and no person will have time for it. Then polar bears will be wiped out anyway.  08 February 2013 (Invasive mussel may wipe out lobsters around Tristan da Cunha)  The UK government was too cheap to clean up mussels on a shipwreck, so the lobsters around Tristan da Cunha will probably be wiped out.  07 February 2013 (New system for encrypted communication)  A new system for encrypted communication is intended to protect dissidents.  The goal is admirable, and is just as important for the US as for other countries. If John Kiriakou had used encrypted communications with reporters, he would not be going to prison for telling us about US government torture.  However, this system raises two questions:   Can a person use this without running any nonfree software? Obviously that's impossible on the iThings, since Apple forbids free software; but even on Android, does it require running nonfree software? You can't trust that, not ever, but especially not for encryption.  Is it proof against the U SAP AT RIOT act? They may not even know if it is used against them. I'm told that the FBI typically gives a "national security letter" to an employee who has access to the data, forbidding him to tell the rest of the company. Thus, if the data are now stored in the US, they cannot expect to find out if the PAT RIOT act is being used against them.   07 February 2013 (Urgent: Gun control)  US citizens: call on Obama to push strongly for gun control.  07 February 2013 (Reverse-engineered irises)  Reverse-Engineered Irises Look So Real, They Fool Eye-Scanners.  I have no wish to disguise my irises as someone else, but we will all need to disguise them regularly as we travel about town if iris scanners can recognize people from a distance.  07 February 2013 (Ethiopian peasants forced off land)  The Ethiopian state is forcing thousands of peasants off their land for foreign investors to set up plantations.  A planned dam will do likewise to many herders.  07 February 2013 (Barriers to international trade)  The WTO is trying to speed up reduction of red tape that impedes international trade.  This might be good for business, but it's bad for people.  The WTO has done harm to the world by making it easier for any company to threaten a state with moving its business somewhere else. This increases the political power of companies over the state, which is the worst political problem in the world today. It is the root cause of "too big to fail" and many other problems.  I suspect that any further step in that direction will make things worse.  Removing barriers to trade leads to more efficiency. More efficiency is desirable if it benefits everyone -- but the WTO will never allow that. The increased political power of business ensures that most people lose.  07 February 2013 (Obama will show assassination legal opinions to Senate)  Obama will show assassination legal opinions to the Senate intelligence committee, but not to us.  Whether the drone base is in Saudi Arabia is a minor detail. Just because bin Laden cared about it is no reason why anyone else should. Let it not be a distraction from the issue of assassination.  07 February 2013 (Urgent: Reopen issue of filibuster reform)  US citizens: call on Senate Majority Leader Reid to reopen the issue of filibuster reform.  07 February 2013 (Urgent: Designate Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness)  US citizens: call for designating the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness and thus preventing oil drilling.  07 February 2013 (Urgent: Reverse the Corporations United decision)  US citizens: sign this petition to Obama to support of the constitutional amendment to reverse the Corporations United decision (to call it what it really is).  07 February 2013 (Boy Scouts of America's religious discrimination)  As the Boy Scouts of America considers admitting gay scouts, it ought to end its religious discrimination &mdash; against Atheists.  07 February 2013 (Unequal justice in the US)  The growing US scandal: one justice for banksters, and another for the rest of us (such as Aaron Swartz).  07 February 2013 (Urgent: Academic freedom in NYC)  Everyone: stand up for academic freedom in New York City.  07 February 2013 (Roundup-resistant weeds)  Over half of US farms that grow Roundup-resistant GMO crops now have Roundup-resistant weeds.  I suppose Monsanto is happy that the farmers now buy a lot more Roundup. However, the basic premise of these crops, that they would make it possible to eliminate weeds easily with a small amount of pesticide, has been invalidated.  It occurs to me that if they had started with crops resistant to two different pesticides, and if all farmers had used both pesticides together, it might have been impossible for weeds to develop resistance to both in parallel. This is the same logic as that behind multi-drug treatment for HIV infection. However, I don't think all farmers would have followed the regime.  07 February 2013 (Lawyer of Ukraine's former PM faces absurd charges)  The former prime minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko, was imprisoned apparently for political motives. Now her lawyer faces charges.  The charges seem to be an absurd grab-bag.  07 February 2013 (Rules for marriage)  Why let the state decide the rules for marriage?  07 February 2013 (Public library reopens, thanks to squatters and protesters)  The public library in Friern Barnet was officially reopened, thanks to squatters and protesters who occupied it and ran it unofficially.  07 February 2013 (Obama's target for cutting CO2 emissions)  Obama's target for cutting US CO2 emissions requires bold new initiatives.  However, it is crucial to cut US exports of fossil fuels as well. Sending them to be burnt elsewhere puts the CO2 in the same atmosphere.  07 February 2013 (EU Parliament votes for sustainable fishing)  The EU Parliament voted for sustainable fishing.  However, this is not the final decision.  07 February 2013 (Legitimacy of assassinations)  When the US carries out assassinations, the crucial question is not whether the victims are US citizens, it is whether assassination is legitimate at all.  I think it should be considered equivalent to sending a squad of soldiers and a tank to attack the same place.  07 February 2013 (Venezuelan prisons)  Venezuelan prisons are ruled by armed gangs of prisoners.  07 February 2013 (The US has no deficit problem)  The US does not have a deficit problem. Its problem is inequality and resulting poverty. Thus, deficit cutting is an excuse for making things worse.  07 February 2013 (Urgent: IRS whistleblower protections and incentives)  US citizens: tell the IRS not to weaken its whistleblower protections and incentives.  07 February 2013 (European countries that helped CIA kidnap flights)  European countries that helped CIA kidnap flights could face prosecution in the European Court of Human Rights.  07 February 2013 (Journalist sentenced to prison for interviewing woman)  Journalist Abdiaziz Abdinur Ibrahim was sentenced to prison for interviewing the Somali woman who accused soldiers of raping her.  07 February 2013 (Tunisian opposition leader assassinated)  A principal Tunisian opposition leader was assassinated.  07 February 2013 (Privatization of UK care for old people)  Privatization of UK care for old people killed one person when the company was shut down.  07 February 2013 (Soot causes babies to have low birth weight)  Soot from diesel engines and burning coal causes babies to have low birth weight.  07 February 2013 ("Testilying" thugs)  Thugs invented the term "testilying" to describe what they typically do on the witness stand.  Thus, if a case comes down to the word of a thug against the accused, you really should not trust the thug.  Even if it is ten thugs and they all agree, that changes nothing. They always have a chance to collude and coordinate their testimony.  This explains why thugs will go to such lengths to prevent video recording of their actions: it can make their testilying ineffective.  07 February 2013 (US back to "voodoo economics")  The US is back to what George I called "voodoo economics".  There's a funny spelling error in the article: it says "mother load" but it should have been "mother lode".  07 February 2013 (Florida Bar takes action against foreclosure baron)  Two Years Later, The Florida Bar Takes Action Against Foreclosure Baron David J. Stern.  07 February 2013 (US giving bin Laden what he wanted)  The US continues giving bin Laden what he wanted.  07 February 2013 (High rate of imprisonment in the US)  A Congressional report says that the high rate of imprisonment in the US is damaging to the prison system, not to mention millions of Americans.  07 February 2013 (Privacy legislation in Europe)  Campaigning for strong privacy legislation in Europe.  This campaign faces opposition from the companies that do Internet surveillance, including Facebook, Google, and other advertising companies.  07 February 2013 (Tax havens deny US up to 150 billion a year)  Congress estimates that tax havens deny the US up to 150 billion dollars a year in tax revenue. The amount seems to be growing, but it is hard to measure.  The world-wide problem is that companies and the rich pay too little tax. They do this by playing one country against another. Thus, they convinced the Netherlands to "attract corporate money" by reducing taxes, and now they want to convince the US to respond by reducing taxes and thus exacerbate the global problem. Every reduction in taxes for the rich adds to society's problem, so all solutions must involve increasing their taxes.  I've proposed a new kind of tax designed to pressure large companies to split up. It involves treating related companies, even in different countries, as a unit for determining the total size.  07 February 2013 (Obama stretches concept of "imminent attack")  How Obama stretched the concept of an "imminent attack" to excuse killing people considered to be hostile.  07 February 2013 (Report smears Julian Assange's speech)  The report on Julian Assange's speech at an award ceremony at Oxford smeared him, by falsely claiming that no supporters of his could be found. It also ignored the work of Dr Fingar, who received the award &mdash; for stopping US intelligence from being distorted so as to start a war.  07 February 2013 (Senators ask for Obama's justification for aerial death squad)  A group of senators have asked Obama to show them the legal opinions that supposedly justify Obama's aerial death squad.  07 February 2013 (Calling on Obama not to block food and medicine to Iran)  Calling on Obama to ensure that sanctions against Iran do not block food and medicine.  In theory, the sanctions do not apply to medicine. In practice, they do.  07 February 2013 (10 questions for architect of killer drone policy)  10 Questions Congress Should Ask Killer Drone Policy Architect John Brennan.  07 February 2013 (Persecution of the homeless in US cities)  Half of major US cities persecute the homeless.  07 February 2013 (Armed, untrained pseudo-thugs in schools)  New way to protect schools: deploying armed pseudo-thugs without training. Some of them have records of violence.  07 February 2013 (Increasing high-tech surveillance in the US)  High-tech surveillance is spreading around the US. This article describes several forms of increasing surveillance.  The article focuses on the companies that build the surveillance technology, but that seems secondary to me.  07 February 2013 (European Commission intends to please copyright industry)  The European Commission is studying copyright licensing but intends to please only the copyright industry.  Here is the full statement by La Quadrature du Net.  07 February 2013 (Israel still claims Palestinian textbooks demonize Jews)  Israel clings to the claim that Palestinian textbooks demonize Jews, rejecting the study that found it was not so.  06 February 2013 (Teenagers sentenced to prison for breaking car window)  Israel sentenced Palestinian teenagers to long prison sentences for breaking a "settler"'s car window.  Contrast this with the impunity that the "settlers" regularly enjoy for all sorts of crimes against Palestinians.  06 February 2013 (Members of Palestinian parliament arrested)  Israel has recently arrested several members of the Palestinian parliament.  6 February 2013 (Urgent: Protect Bees) Everyone:  call on Bayer to withdraw neonicotinoid pesticides from sale, to protect bees.  6 February 2013 (Urgent: Support HR 499) US citizens: support HR 499 to  end federal prohibition of marijuana.  6 February 2013 (Urgent: Protect endangered sharks) Everyone: call on Panama to support  protection of endangered sharks.  06 February 2013 (Federalizing issues to prevent stronger regulations)  How business prevents cities and states from pushing for stronger regulations: federalize the issue, by passing a weak federal law which blocks cities and states from doing anything stronger.  Agribusiness is about to use this on labeling of GMOs.  06 February 2013 (The lies that led the US into war)  10 years after Colin Powell's speech of lies led the US into war, don't forget how he did it &mdash; or how Kerry supported it. The same thing may be done with Iran or Syria.  06 February 2013 (Mass shootings pose greater danger than home-grown terrorism)  Although the FBI says it is very concerned about possible home-grown Islamic terrorism, in fact mass shooting are a much bigger danger.  However, other murders (not done by mass shooting) are a much bigger danger than that.  06 February 2013 (Attack on Israeli tourists)  At attack on Israeli tourists in Bulgaria has reportedly been linked to Hezbollah.  06 February 2013 (Gunman shoots at Lars Hedegaard)  Someone shot at Lars Hedegaard, underscoring his warnings against attempts at censorship in the name of Islam.  06 February 2013 (Increase in number of earthworms)  Global heating increases the number of earthworms, which results in more greenhouse gas emissions from the soil.  06 February 2013 (Obama's excuses for ordering assassinations)  Obama published a redacted version of his legalistic excuses for ordering assassinations, but it's enough to point out multiple outrages.  06 February 2013 (Israeli and Palestinian water supplies)  "Cooperation" between Israel and Palestine about allocation of water supplies, set up by the Oslo agreement, turned out to be a way to legitimize robbery.  06 February 2013 (Julian Assange's remote speech at Oxford)  The text of Julian Assange's remote speech at Oxford.  06 February 2013 (Malaysia hands refugees to China)  Malaysia handed Chinese Uighur refugees back to China.  06 February 2013 (Asian Pulp and Paper to stop cutting Indonesian rainforest)  Asian Pulp and Paper says it will stop cutting down Indonesian rainforest to make paper.  This is in response to public pressure &mdash; you've seen the campaigns in the urgent notes on this site. It took considerable pressure, which shows the business is very profitable. Thus, I expect that Asian Pulp and Paper will try to start again as soon as our backs are turned. Perhaps not directly &mdash; perhaps it will sell the business to someone else, or subcontract it. Businesses have many ways of disguising responsibility.  06 February 2013 (Woman in Somalia charged with insulting the state)  A woman in Somalia who accused soldiers of raping her faces charges of insulting the state.  Most countries reserve that particular injustice for dissidents.  The Somali government was effectively imposed by the US, after a US-backed Ethiopian intervention destroyed the Islamic Courts government. Islamic law is vicious, but after years of warfare I don't think Somalis wanted to return to several years more of it. No once again they have less fighting (I wouldn't yet call it peace), and they probably appreciate that, but this government doesn't seem to be better than the one they had a few years ago.  06 February 2013 (CIA kidnapings)  54 countries appear to have cooperated with CIA kidnapings, including Iran. Apparently, making a deal with Iran is not out of reach for the US.  06 February 2013 (Selective abortions)  This article perversely claims that aborting fetuses because they have Down's syndrome (a major birth defect that affects intelligence) is unfair discrimination, arguing that it is equivalent to aborting fetuses because they are female.  That equivalence is valid, but the proper conclusion is the opposite of the author's position. Aborting fetuses selectively is ethical regardless of the criterion.  A woman is not an incubator. She is entitled to abort a pregnancy for any reason, or for no reason. It is legitimate to abort a fetus because it is female, because it is male, because it is blond, or because it was conceived in a month with a "u" in its name.  It is only against persons that discrimination can be unfair. A fetus is not a person. If it is aborted (for whatever reason), it never becomes a person, thus no person is discriminated against by the abortion.  In fact, many people selectively abort female fetuses because they are prejudiced against females. If you are female, you have good reason to rebuke that prejudice, which is aimed at you too. But don't endanger your own abortion rights by attacking theirs. Their abortions don't wrong you; their prejudice does.  I think we should celebrate the fact that fewer people have birth defects nowadays, thanks to abortion rights.  06 February 2013 (Cost of gasoline)  If you drive, 15 years of gasoline adds up to buying a car. Thus, a fuel-efficient car is a very good investment.  06 February 2013 (How companies betray American workers)  How companies betray American workers, step by step.  Government support for research is not a bad thing, in and of itself. It is an example of how companies get tremendous benefit from the public that they shaft &mdash; but we need not depend on that argument to show that we should not tolerate their present-day behavior.  06 February 2013 (Censorship of Indian film)  Indian film-maker Kamal Haasan says he will go into exile after his latest film was censored by the state in response to Muslim intolerance.  06 February 2013 (The caste system)  Paradoxically, the caste system gives some Dalits economic security although they are despised as a result.  06 February 2013 (When foreign companies use servers in the US)  When foreign companies use servers in the US, they let the US snoop on all their communication with their clients via Bush's originally illegal massive surveillance program.  This article uses the vague term "cloud computing", which is so vague that it is meaningless. In this article, it means that companies host their services on servers in the US. In some other article, it will mean something else. You need to be an expert to tell what it means. Let's make our statements clear, not cloudy: let's shun the term "cloud" in the computing field.  06 February 2013 (Stalking and private spying with drones)  Drones can be used for stalking and private spying.  It is obvious that privately owned drones can be used this way. The same will happen with government drones. The people who run them will use them for personal, unofficial purposes too.  06 February 2013 (Malala Yousafzai's recovery)  Malala Yousafzai is recovering well enough to return to activism for women in Pakistan.  06 February 2013 (Greek thugs torture bank robbers)  Greek thugs tortured bank robbers, then tried to cover it up by altering their photos.  I used to think that it was wrong to rob a bank, but I can no longer see a reason to criticize it, now that banksters rob us over and over and are not even charged with a crime.  06 February 2013 (Egyptian thugs torture protester)  Egyptian thugs appear to have tortured a protester to death. There may be many more victims.  06 February 2013 (Keeping San Francisco thugs from having tasers)  Organizing to keep San Francisco thugs from having tasers.  06 February 2013 (Pre-emptive cyberattacks)  The US president must not be allowed to order pre-emptive cyberattacks on his own.  06 February 2013 (Absurd charges of terrorism against Lynne Stewart)  How the Bush regime had defense lawyer Lynne Stewart convicted on absurd charges of terrorism.  06 February 2013 (UK orders banks to separate risky investments from banking)  The UK orders banks to separate their risky investments from their banking, threatening to split them up if they don't do this.  It would be both simpler and less risky to make them split up now, so I suppose the banks don't want that. Perhaps they hope to sneakily hold on to some of the benefits by not really separating these activities.  06 February 2013 (Long prison terms given to Vietnamese dissidents)  Vietnamese dissidents were sentenced to long prison terms. Another was put in a mental hospital, Soviet-style.  06 February 2013 (UK gives oil companies a billion pounds of subsidy)  The UK gives oil companies a billion pounds of subsidy.  06 February 2013 (UK thugs used phony identities based on dead children)  Like Russian spies, UK thug infiltrators generated phony identities based on children who had died.  06 February 2013 (Israeli and Palestinian textbooks)  Both Israeli and Palestinian textbooks show no border between Israel and Palestine.  And both teach very little about the other culture.  06 February 2013 (Suspicion of soccer match rigging)  Investigators suspect hundreds of soccer matches in Europe were rigged.  06 February 2013 (Vague safety requirement for Arctic oil drilling)  A proposed agreement to cover Arctic oil drilling has a safety requirement so vague that it is not even a serious effort.  06 February 2013 (Giant stick-insect not extinct as thought)  A giant stick-insect, thought to be extinct, has been found on a tiny island. It could be reintroduced to its principal home if only the rats there were eradicated.  I think it won't be hard to love insects that (1) don't bother humans in any way and (2) form lasting couples.  06 February 2013 (Egyptian thugs strip and beat Hamada Saber)  After Egyptian thugs stripped and beat Hamada Saber, they forced him to say they were helping him.  06 February 2013 (Indians resist nuclear power plant)  Indians stubbornly resist the Kudankulam nuclear power plant.  06 February 2013 (Female genital mutilation in Indonesia)  Female genital mutilation is increasing in Indonesia, pushed by radical Muslims and doctors that want more business.  06 February 2013 (Fighting oil drilling and fracking in Colorado)  Fighting oil drilling and fracking in Colorado.  Since 80% of known fossil fuel needs to be left in the ground, anywhere the local people want to do this, their preference should be heeded without question.  06 February 2013 (Censorship in Israel)  How Israeli censors journalism and political advocacy.  06 February 2013 (Sued for giving criticism)  Pyo Chang-won, forensic psychologist, is being sued by South Korea's intelligence agency for criticizing its actions.  06 February 2013 (Spain reacts to corruption)  Spain reacts to the corruption at the center of the right-wing ruling party.  06 February 2013 ("Security" agency in Honduras)  The government of Honduras has set up a "security" agency that will operate with little control.  This government was set up by a coup that was probably approved by the US.  05 February 2013 (Too Big To Fail)   Fixing too big to fail  5 February 2013 (Protesters in Portugal prosecuted) Protesters in Portugal are prosecuted for  presenting pamphlets.  5 February 2013 (Internet censorship in Russia) Russia begins extreme censorship of the Internet,  imitating recent satire.  5 February 2013 (Advice from Human Rights Watch)  Human Rights Watch gives advice about how to build a state that respects human rights,  once a dictator has been overthrown.   5 February 2013 (Obama to allow prospecting for oil in Atlantic)  Obama plans to allow prospecting for oil in Atlantic undersea canyons  that are rich for fishing. The "all of the above" strategy is a way of exporting lots of fossil fuels for other countries to burn, so even as the US's own emissions decline, it will contribute to increasing total global emissions.  5 February 2013 (Ramarley Graham's family suing NY thugs)  The family of teenager Ramarley Graham are suing the New York thugs, saying that after they killed him,  they threatened to kill his grandmother too. The War on Drugs systematically results in such killings. It does other bad things, not quite as fatal, to a lot more people and has led to imprisoning millions of Americans. We have to stop it.  5 February 2013 (Concessions on uranium enrichment in Iran)  Iran demands a clear offer of some advantages in exchange for concessions on uranium enrichment.  That seems like an invitation to make a deal that would put the possibility of Iranian nuclear weapons off the table. Countries that say that this possibility is frightening ought to offer substantial concessions in exchange for avoiding it.  5 February 2013 (Drone assassinations) Are drone assassinations the latest form of a death squad?  05 February 2013 (Hunger caused by scarcity of democracy)  The world makes enough food &mdash; hunger is caused by a scarcity of democracy.  05 February 2013 (Skirting the issue of mobile phone surveillance)  US government "do not track" proposals evade the real issue of mobile phone surveillance.  05 February 2013 (Genocide and war are separate things)  Charging that the US cultivates concern about genocide to create excuses for war.  This argument is partly valid; "genocide" can be an excuse for intervention. However, it is one of many excuses that are used. The possibility of false charges of genocide does not mean we should ignore it when it is real.  Another moral flaw in the article is the attempt to equate leaving a group vulnerable to a massacre with carrying out a massacre.  The article claims that genocide comes from war, but that was false in the case of the massacre of Indonesian Communists, and more false than true in the case Hitler. In any case, war does not automatically cause genocide; they are two separate things.  Ultimately, we cannot consider national sovereignty a source of moral value &mdash; states deserve value only a means to ends, such as freedom and well-being for people. When they cease to serve valid ends, as the US government has mostly done, they no longer command our value.  05 February 2013 (Pitfall of idealizing primitive peoples practices)  On the pitfall of idealizing primitive peoples' practices as a form of paradise.  They are just as prone to cruel or self-defeating practices as we are.  05 February 2013 (Inequality for All)  The film Inequality for All may spur resistance to the plutocracy in the US.  05 February 2013 (Unions in NY City supporting anti-worker Democrat)  Unions in New York City are supporting an anti-worker Democrat because she is right-wing enough to maybe beat a Republican.  In the short term, that can maybe win an election. In the long term, as shown by Clinton and Obama, it is the road to losing on the issues.  It is even worse in the UK: major unions support the mildly right-wing "Labour Party".  05 February 2013 (Work in the US morphing into sweatshop labor)  Work in the US, in many areas, is morphing into sweatshop labor as businesses take advantage of high unemployment and an anti-union climate.  04 February 2013 (Atlanta thugs in prison for framing and killing)  Atlanta thugs framed Kathryn Johnston (age 92), shot her dead, then decided to frame her some more. They went to prison thanks to an informant they tried to use, who informed on them instead.  04 February 2013 (Land of the free, home of the brave?)  Land of the free? Home of the brave? Not much any more.  04 February 2013 (Teaching children about dangers of coal)  Teaching children about the many dangers of coal.  04 February 2013 (Cathrynn Brown wants to prosecute doctors who do abortions)  Cathrynn Brown doesn't want to prosecute raped women who get abortions. Only the doctors who do the abortions.  04 February 2013 (Urgent: Make publicly traded companies publish political spending)  US citizens: Call on the SEC to make publicly traded companies publish their political spending.  04 February 2013 (Julian Assange explains about Facebook)  Julian Assange explains how telling Facebook about your friends is effectively working for Big Brother.  The response from Facebook appears superficially like a denial, but don't be fooled &mdash; really it only says that Facebook has no choice about giving data to the US. And that is true, under the U SAP AT RIOT Act: once they make the choice to invite people to give you this data, they have no choice about handing it over.  This ultimately supports the argument that collecting the data is bad.  04 February 2013 (High cost of education in the UK)  In the UK, education has become so expensive that only rich children can dream of entering a profession. For the rest, it is more rational to dream of being a sports star.  The US got there long ago, except that it offers college loans that will be a weight around a person's neck for life.  04 February 2013 (Agribusiness-controlled genetic engineering)  Genetic engineering of food, under control of agribusiness, has failed to contribute much to world food production.  Perhaps that's because companies like Monsanto are interested in taking control of agriculture rather than in improving it.  04 February 2013 (Urgent: A road to US citizenship)  US citizens: urge the senate to offer a road to citizenship for the illegal immigrants in the US.  04 February 2013 (Politicians seek to restrict speech Brooklyn College)  New York politicians seek to impose politically biased limits on talks at Brooklyn College.  The campaign is led by Alan Dershowitz, who makes false claims exposed in this article.  04 February 2013 (Marriage)  Marriage doesn't foster foster social stability and economic prosperity. Rather, it needs them in order to succeed. Thus, right-wing pressure for marriage is an excuse to attack and endanger working women, who lack that stability thanks to other right-wing policies.  04 February 2013 (Journalists banned from battlefield in Mali)  Journalists have been banned from battlefields in Mali, so we don't really know what is happening and can't verify claims about casualties.  04 February 2013 (Reporter Daniel Lain&eacute; convicted in secret trial )  Reporter Daniel Lain&eacute; exposed prostitution and human trafficking in Cambodia, so the Cambodian government has sentenced him to 7 years in prison for doing business with prostitutes, and is using Interpol to persecute him.  Lain&eacute;'s secret trial reminds me of US injustice standards. Meanwhile, to make it a crime to do business with prostitutes is wrong in itself, even when that law is not used against journalism.  04 February 2013 (10 to 60 billion dollars moved into tax havens each year)  US companies are moving 10 to 60 billion dollars a year into tax havens.  04 February 2013 (US considers new biofuel requirements)  The US is considering new biofuel requirements that could cause diversion of food as fuel.  04 February 2013 (Lingering polar ozone depletion)  The lingering polar ozone depletion seems to reduce the ocean's ability to absorb CO2.  04 February 2013 (Protests against Morsi invigorated)  A video showing Egyptian thugs strip and beat a protester has invigorated protests against Morsi.  04 February 2013 (Individual banksters to pay Libor fine)  Individual banksters will have to pay the Libor fine imposed on RBS.  04 February 2013 (Things on the Internet that upset children)  Of the many things on the Internet that upset children, porn and bullying are not particularly bad.  Of course, it is ridiculous to think one should, or could, keep all upset out of a child's life. We can try to stop gross or persistent mistreatment, because a life without that is possible at least in principle. However, a life without upset is an impossible goal.  04 February 2013 (Urgent: Amend the CFAA)  US citizens: ask Congress to amend the CFAA so it couldn't be used to prosecute violating terms of service.  Here's the EFF's comment on Rep. Lofgren's latest version of the changes.  04 February 2013 (Urgent: Constitutional amendments)  US citizens: support newly introduced constitutional amendments to say human rights are for people, not corporations, and authorize limits on campaign spending.  04 February 2013 (NRA lobbies for laws to gag doctors)  The NRA lobbies for laws banning doctors from explaining the danger of having guns at home.  04 February 2013 (Prison conditions where Pussy Riot dissidents are held)  The prison where Pussy Riot dissidents are held is as bad as the Soviet Gulag. However, not as bad as the conditions in which the US put whistleblower Bradley Manning.  04 February 2013 (Mainstream media host says Obama should adopt Republican policy)  A mainstream media TV host says Obama should trick Republicans by advocating a right-wing policy (budget cuts).  What planet is he on? Republicans would hardly be caught off balance this way. Obama has tried this trick so many times that they must expect it by now.  Scarborough's comments on Krugman sound like the way supporters of open source often criticize me. If you appreciate my work, one way you can help is by saying "free/libre software" and avoiding the term "open source".  04 February 2013 (Intelligence claims reported by US mainstream media)  When US mainstream media report on intelligence claims that the Syrian army is preparing chemical weapons for use, they take for granted that the claims are accurate.  The US has received false intelligence claims before.  04 February 2013 (When Truth Tried to Stop War)  When Truth Tried to Stop War.  04 February 2013 (Movement to establish and defend commons)  A reaction to capitalist privatization: the movement to establish and defend commons, with usage rules different from private property.  04 February 2013 ("Invisible hand" replaced by corporate dealmakers)  In the US economy, the "invisible hand" is obsolete, replaced by the tangible hands of corporate dealmakers. In the case of Goldman Sachs, we can sometimes see whose hands they are.  04 February 2013 (Criminal convictions through testimony of anonymous "experts")  The US allows criminal convictions to be procured through testimony of anonymous "experts".  Anyone could be convicted of almost anything, that way.  04 February 2013 (Shari'a law means mutilation and killing)  Shari'a law in Mali, as elsewhere, means mutilation and killing.  Anyone who advocates shari'a law is advocating this.  04 February 2013 (Google settles dispute with French newspapers)  Google has settled a dispute with French newspapers about posting links to news articles, or perhaps about quoting their titles.  The dispute raises several important issues which this article only hints at.   Does a web site operator need permission to post links to another site?  Does a web site operator need permission to quote the title of an article? What about a couple of sentences from it?  Is Google's advertising system, based on surveillance, a benefit to society or is it an injustice?   03 February 2013 (Privacy Battle - Corrected link)   Don't Surrender the Privacy Battle.  03 February 2013 (Many US soldiers killing themselves)  Many US soldiers are killing themselves, often based on various kinds of guilt.  03 February 2013 (Waitress fired for posting statement written by client)  A waitress was fired for the indiscretion of posting a statement written by a client expressing resentment for a mandatory service charge.  A restaurant has a valid reason to fire a staff person who embarrasses customers in connection with that restaurant, regardless of details. If she had made it impossible to determine the restaurant's identity, the restaurant company probably would not have cared, or heard.  However, this article's larger point is valid: the system tipping imposes stress on waiters.  I dislike tipping, and I firmly refuse all requests to introduce it into areas of work where it is not already customary, such as in shops. However, I tip waiters and cab drivers because I know that this is how they are expected to get paid.  I would much rather that restaurants eliminated tipping, and were expected &mdash; and legally required &mdash; to pay their staff adequate wages. I rather that the price in the menu be the amount I will actually pay.  03 February 2013 (BP sued for manipulating natural gas market)  A former employee is suing BP alleging that BP manipulated the natural gas market.  I wonder, is the US or a state investing this alleged crime, and will it be prosecuted if possible? Or will "prosecutorial discretion" be employed yet again to let the big companies off and focus on human rights defenders?  03 February 2013 (UK fishing business)  The UK government boasts of success in protecting the short-term profits of the fishing business against its (and everyone's) long-term viability.  03 February 2013 (Bullies fine sharers in New Zealand)  The copyright lobby's bullies have begun fining sharers in New Zealand.  Although USD 500 is not enough to bankrupt most people, it big is enough to frighten most people &mdash; and they might be able to impose bigger fines too.  This victim made a public apology granting legitimacy to the the system that attacked her. She probably did this for a reason, such as hope that it would reduce her fine. And that may well be true. This is part of the nasty effect of the system: the victims are pressured into praising the oppression.  Thus, the rest of us, those who are not being threatened, must condemn this system, and the entire war on sharing.  02 February 2013 (Stephen King supports gun control plan)  Stephen King tells gun owners why they should support Obama's gun control plan.  The article advertises a longer version available from Amazon in a way that doesn't respect users' freedom.  US gun owners say a lot about their freedom to own guns. I hope they value their freedoms as readers also, and will for that reason refuse to buy that story or any literature from Amazon.  Or any other products either, given the way Amazon treats its warehouse staff, and the fact that you can't buy anonymously.  02 February 2013 (Cats threaten bird life)  Cats (including pets, but especially feral cats) are a big threat to bird life, to the extent that the presence of a cat-eating predator in the neighborhood causes a visible increase in bird life.  I would be in favor of trapping and killing feral cats &mdash; they don't have the right to life &mdash; but trapping and sterilizing them would be an advance also. However, to make this approach effective, it needs to cover pet cats that go out of the house.  02 February 2013 (Colder winters in Europe and Asia)  Global heating leads to colder winters in Europe and Asia, by means of a weather pattern that sends Arctic air south some of the time.  Thus, if you're in Europe and seeing more snow than normal, it doesn't mean the Earth is ok.  02 February 2013 (Obama protects rights of female employees)  Obama has protected the rights of female employees and the preferences of churches, at the expense of insurance companies.  It seems good to me.  02 February 2013 (Wolverines to be labeled as endangered)  Wolverines will be labeled as endangered, because global heating is destroying their habitat.  02 February 2013 (China arrests 16 of Tibet's principal monks)  16 of the principal monks in Tibet were arrested by the Chinese and are being held incommunicado.  02 February 2013 (The US Copyright Office)  The US Copyright Office is tightly linked to the companies in the copyright lobby.  02 February 2013 (Urgent: Resist ALEC's attempts to discourage renewable energy)  US citizens: call on your state legislators to resist ALEC's attempts to discourage renewable energy.  02 February 2013 (Urgent: Cut military spending)  US citizens: tell Congress to cut military spending, not civilian needs.  02 February 2013 (Urgent: Revoke charter of HSBC)  Everyone: call on Maryland to revoke the charter of HSBC for participating in organized crime.  02 February 2013 (Forcing poor people off their land for "development")  "Development" often means governments force inconvenient poor people off their land.  02 February 2013 (UK gov't accredits "Christian Education" schools)  Lunatic Christians go far beyond denying evolution. The UK government accredits "Christian Education" schools which deny that fusion occurs in the Sun.  02 February 2013 (Australia promises to protect Great Barrier Reef)  Australia has promised UNESCO to protect the Great Barrier Reef from ships carrying coal for export.  The Great Barrier Reef is made of coral. CO2 emitted into the air dissolves into the ocean, making it more acidic, and at a certain point not far away, it will be too acidic for coral to make its exoskeleton.  Thus, while exporting coal might cause local damage to the Great Barrier Reef, burning the coal will destroy it all.  02 February 2013 (US CO2 emissions fall to level of 1995)  US CO2 emissions have fallen to the level of 1995, due to conservation and renewable energy sources.  This is an advance good, but if the US extracts lots of coal and gas for export, that will cancel it the advance.  02 February 2013 (Thug sentenced to 7 years for shooting protester)  A thug in Bahrain has been sentenced to 7 years in prison for shooting a protester.  For thugs to face justice for their crimes is rare in any country, so seeing this occur in repressive Bahrain is a big (and positive) surprise. Unfortunately, this alone does not mean the repression of dissent in Bahrain has ended.  02 February 2013 (Proposed Turkish law to impede abortion)  A proposed Turkish law would make abortion impossible for rural women through artificial impediments.  02 February 2013 (Gun companies pre-market guns to teenagers)  Gun companies license their trademarks to video games to pre-market their guns to teenagers.  02 February 2013 (Urgent: Boycott Woodstock Foods)  US citizens: boycott Woodstock Foods for union-busting, and phone to complain.  02 February 2013 (How VISA supports ALEC)  How VISA supports ALEC (though the details are secret).  02 February 2013 (Malian soldiers fill well to cover up crimes)  Malian soldiers filled in a well so that people can't tell if Touaregs they arrested were shot and dumped in it.  Mali needs an accommodation with Touaregs so as to keep the Islamist freaks down.  02 February 2013 (Shell oil spills in seas off Britain)  Even in the ice-free seas off Britain, Shell has several oil spills a month.  02 February 2013 (Agribusiness subjects workers to horrible conditions)  US agribusiness hires illegal immigrants so it can subject workers to horrible conditions.  The US should put a stop to this so that farm workers can have the same rights and protections as other workers. The reason we can easily afford it is that those workers get a tiny fraction of what we pay for food.  02 February 2013 (Dishonesty of theocratic Christianity)  The dishonesty of theocratic Christianity is revealed in proposed laws that would teach "critical thinking" &mdash; but only of science that Christianity doesn't like.  What can we say about a church whose attitude is, "By hook or by crook"?  Religion's denial of evolution can kill people, since resistance to antibiotics is evolution in action. Let's teach critical thinking about religion.  02 February 2013 (EU to implement two-year ban on neonicotinoid pesticides)  The European Union is moving to implement a two-year ban on neonicotinoid pesticides.  It would be good to explain why two years.  02 February 2013 (Local gov't blocks UK plans for nuclear waste disposal site)  A local government blocked the UK plans to set up a permanent nuclear waste disposal site.  02 February 2013 (UK plans to privatize search and rescue)  The UK plans to privatize search and rescue, now performed by the navy and air force.  The private contractors will have to squeeze profits out of the staff, the equipment, and the people who need rescue. Imagine how they will ask people who need to be rescued, "Can you make it worth our while to go out? How many millions can you offer?"  Privatizing a government service is generally harmful unless it gives the public the benefit of buying in a competitive market.  02 February 2013 (Grasping at straws)   Senators are grasping at straws to oppose Hagel's nomination.  One senator accused Hagel of "extreme views far to the left even of this administration". Obama, more right-wing than Nixon, is no Liberal, but right-wingers like to pretend he is.  It is  too bad that Hagel won't admit that Bush's "troop surge" in Iraq was ineffective.  02 February 2013 (Reform of the CFAA law)  The  EFF proposes improvements for the reform of the CFAA law.  02 February 2013 (Secret funds to Spanish PM's party leaders)  Prime Minister Rajoy, who has inflicted poverty and repression on Spain, appears to have funneled secret funds to leaders of his right-wing party.  02 February 2013 (Illegal detention by ICE)  ACLU-PA Files Suit On Behalf Of Woman Illegally Detained By ICE.  02 February 2013 (NY thugs interrogate 7-year-old for 10 hours)  A 7-year-old withstood 10 hours of interrogation by New York thugs.  Schools should take action to stop bullying and protect other children, but handing possible bullies over to bigger bullies is not the way.  02 February 2013 (Respect for tradition)  Respect for tradition can be an excuse to deny human rights.  02 February 2013 (Morocco remains repressive)  Morocco remains repressive despite its new constitution.  02 February 2013 (Equifax buys personal data of American workers)  Equifax has bought personal data about the employment of 1/3 of American workers from their employers.  02 February 2013 (Mental illness does not imply tendency towards violence)  Don't make the mistake of assuming mental illness implies a tendency towards violence.  02 February 2013 (Contracts on the Internet)  The contracts that Internet users mostly accept without reading must be replaced with laws spelling out citizens' rights and responsibilities as Internet users.  02 February 2013 (Weak security in security cameras)  Many models of security camera video recorder have very weak security and crackers can easily take remote control of them.  Please don't use the word "hacker" to mean "someone who breaks security". That's unfair to us hackers.  Besides, with these machines, no security-breaking is needed.  02 February 2013 ("Al Qa'ida" name used by separate organizations)  Clinton pretends that "Al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb" is the same organization and even the same people that were in al Qa'ida in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  As has been explained elsewhere the two are separate organizations, with only some ideas and a name in common. They are both bad, because of those ideas, but they don't add up to a global threat.  02 February 2013 (Urgent: Keep WiFi free)  In the US: call on Verizon not to kill free WiFi in restaurants and other public places.  02 February 2013 (Sponsor of PBS drone coverage)  PBS drone coverage was sponsored by a manufacturer of drones.  02 February 2013 (Urgent: Legalize unlocking of phones)  US citizens: sign this petition for legalizing unlocking of phones.  The business model of selling hardware cheap, then charging people as they use it, generally leads to trashing users' freedom. Rather than prop it up, a good government would aim to stop it.  02 February 2013 (Iraq arrests journalist for taking photos)  Iraq has arrested a journalist for taking photos in a "restricted area" &mdash; on the street, it seems.  Maybe Iraq's government is imitating US practice.  02 February 2013 (Israel could be prosecuted in the International Criminal Court)  The UN Human Rights Council says Israel could be prosecuted in the International Criminal Court if it does not abandon its colonies in occupied Palestinian territory.  The purpose of these colonies was, all along, to annex territory and prevent a real Palestinian state. Israel hardly denied that.  02 February 2013 (How easily the US could have left Aaron Swartz alone)  Just how easily the US could have left Aaron Swartz alone is demonstrated by how the US treated Piers Morgan, after he admitted manipulating stocks at the expense of his readers.  02 February 2013 (Urgent: Boycott SodaStream)  Everyone: support the boycott of SodaStream, which manufactures in an Israeli colony in Palestinian territory.  02 February 2013 (Urgent: Stop deafening whales with sonar)  US citizens: call on the US Navy to stop deafening whales with sonar.  02 February 2013 (Urgent: Path to citizenship)  US citizens: support giving illegal US immigrants a path to citizenship.  02 February 2013 (Guantanamo kangaroo courts squelch talk of torture)  In Guantanamo kangaroo courts, even topics that might come near torture are squelched.  02 February 2013 (Urgent: Attention to the matter of Prosecutor Ortiz)  US citizens: tell Obama, pay attention to the matter of Prosecutor Ortiz.  02 February 2013 (Misunderstanding the danger of computing idea patents)  An example of misunderstanding the danger of computing idea patents is this petition, which is aimed at only part of the problem: the patents that would probably not hold up in court.  A real solution needs to protect software developers and users from all computational patents.  02 February 2013 (Facebook graph search: ideal tool for phishing)  Facebook graph search is an ideal tool for sophisticated, targeted phishing.  02 February 2013 (Proposed constitutional amendment)  This proposed constitutional amendment blocks corporations from claiming rights as humans, and also assures that campaign funding regulations are allowed.  02 February 2013 (Shell oil spill in Nigeria)  Shell was found responsible for one oil spill in Nigeria, but not at fault in several others.  02 February 2013 ("Child porn " witch hunts)  A victim of the "child porn" witch hunt condemns the idea of these accusations on principle.  02 February 2013 (Whole Foods CEO's views on his customers' health care)  The CEO of Whole Foods has views about his customers' health care that they might not like to support.  02 February 2013 (1984)  Forget 1984 and Conspiracy Stories, This is the Real Thing.  02 February 2013 (US gov't wants to allow navy to endanger whales)  The US government wants to give the navy carte blanche to endanger whales.  02 February 2013 (Cats kill more birds than wind turbines)  Death of birds is used as an excuse to oppose wind turbines, but the big danger to birds is from pet cats.  02 February 2013 (Brominated vegetable oil in Gatorade)  Gatorade will stop containing dangerous brominated vegetable oil.  Drinking an artificial beverage, more than very occasionally, is an unnecessary risk. If it doesn't have sugar, which makes people fat, then it probably has diet sweeteners, which studies have found to confuse the brain (since some sugar receptors notice them but then they don't provide the calories that the brain was expecting). And they have lots of other additives, each of which might be safe or might be dangerous.  I rarely drink anything but water and tea.  01 February 2013 (AT&amp;T trying to deregulate IP networks)  AT&amp;T is trying to use a previous bad FCC decision &mdash; that IP networks don't need to be regulated &mdash; as an excuse to argue that switching to Internet should mean total deregulation of telephone networks in the US.  Only someone who wants to be fooled would be fooled by this. However, government officials often have practical reasons to want to be fooled by a company.  01 February 2013 (Sale of neonicotinoid pesticides)  Some UK retail companies have stopped selling neonicotinoid pesticides.  However, industrial use amounts to far more. It is crucial to stop that.  01 February 2013 (Spanish economy crashing)  The Spanish economy is crashing due to austerity policies.  It is only what we must expect from austerity.  01 February 2013 (Islands shrinking due to rising seas)  Due to rising seas, Bangladeshis who fled the shrinking island of Kutubdia will soon have to flee their new homes.  Millions of people will be driven into exile over the next few decades.  The Sundarbans, which is principal remaining habitat for tigers, is also being destroyed. At current rates, it will be gone in 50 years, but we know it is going to accelerate.  01 February 2013 (US prosecutors hardly dare prosecute giant banks)  US prosecutors found Aaron Swartz a tempting target for exaggerated accusations, but hardly dare prosecute a giant bank for giant fraud.  This demonstrates the need to eliminate such large banks. We must make sure that no bank is so big that its failure would be important to anyone but its owners.  01 February 2013 (Guantanamo defense lawyers ask to be locked up)  Guantanamo defense lawyers ask to be locked up for two nights to experience the prison.  Not allowing the prisoners to meet with their lawyers is one injustice among many in the Guantanamo kangaroo courts.  01 February 2013 (Americans charged for access to unemployment benefits)  Big banks charge Americans millions to access their unemployment benefits.  01 February 2013 (Warrantless access to prescription records)  As part of the War on Pain Sufferers, the US government wants warrantless access to people's prescription records. Oregon is trying to resist, with support from the ACLU.  01 February 2013 (Catholic Church's criterion for calling a fetus a person)  The Catholic Church says a fetus is not a person if calling it one would cost the Church money.  01 February 2013 (Guns won't help rid us of tyranny)  Owning lots of guns is neither necessary nor sufficient for getting rid of tyranny.  01 February 2013 (Prosecution of Aaron Swartz part of broader gov't plan)  The prosecution of Aaron Swartz and others who campaign to inform the public is part of a broader government plan to keep the public in the dark.  31 January 2013 (Urgent: Support Ron Grijalva)  US citizens: support Ron Grijalva for Secretary of the Interior.  I support him because Dennis Kucinich endorsed him. I trust Kucinich.  31 January 2013 (Waste from nuclear power stations)  Nobody knows a reliably safe way to deal with waste from nuclear power stations.  This is made worse by the great probability that technological society will collapse in 40 years or so under the pressure of agricultural failures due to global heating. A globalized supply chain can be shut down by a localized problem almost anywhere.  31 January 2013 (Half the world's coal combustion done in China)  Half the world's coal combustion is done in China.  31 January 2013 (Iranian journalists being arrested)  Iranian journalists are being arrested for continuing relationships with journalist friends who have fled into exile.  31 January 2013 (Islamists chased out)  The intervention in Mali has chased the Islamists out of the towns and dispersed them.  This means things are more or less back to the way they were a year or so ago, except that the ancient Islamic manuscripts and shrines of Timbuktu are lost forever. I hope other Muslims recognize that the extremists are enemies of them as well as enemies of everyone else.  If France gets out quickly, and if the Malian government (or what passes for one) makes some sort of autonomy deal with the Touaregs, things may remain more or less stable.  31 January 2013 (Israel refuses to participate in review of its human rights policies)  Israel is the first UN member ever to refuse to participate in a review of its human rights policies.  31 January 2013 (Unauthorized settler colony built on private land)  An unauthorized Israeli settler colony was built without permits on private Palestinian land.  When Palestinians build homes, schools, wells, or corrals on their own land without a permit, Israeli soldiers knock them down. What will they do to this colony? Probably find an excuse to authorize it.  31 January 2013 (Israel puts Palestinian village under siege)  Israel has put the Palestinian village of Beit Iksa under siege, not allowing people or supplies in, and not allowing people or garbage out.  This is to punish the inhabitants for protesting the theft of their land.  31 January 2013 (Plans for forcible removal of Negev Bedouin)  The Israeli government continues planning to forcibly relocate the Bedouin of the Negev.  31 January 2013 (Israeli draft resister Natan Blanc)  Israeli draft resister Natan Blanc refuses to take an easy way out: he keeps refusing to be conscripted to enforce the occupation of Palestine and keeps getting jailed for it.  This is what Natan refuses to do.  31 January 2013 (Urgent: Rally against violence against women)  Everywhere: support global rallies against violence against women on Feb 14.  31 January 2013 (How the rich are destroying the US economy)  The Non Zero-Sum Society: How the Rich Are Destroying the US Economy.  31 January 2013 (Competition to destroy Berlin's surveillance cameras)  A competition to destroy Berlin's surveillance cameras.  When will someone try this in London?  31 January 2013 (Ortiz wanted to make example of Aaron Swartz)  State prosecutors wanted to give Aaron Swartz probation without a conviction, but US Attorney Ortiz decided to make an example of him.  The article also shows how Ortiz has tried to stretch the practice of civil forfeiture. Civil forfeiture is inherently unjust, but this case takes the cake.  Some members of Congress have called for an investigation of why Aaron Swartz was prosecuted so heavily.  31 January 2013 (Phone unlocking vs jailbreaking)  In the US, it remains legal to jailbreak a phone (but not a tablet). Unlocking from a phone carrier is what is prohibited.  31 January 2013 (Insurance companies charge rich drivers lower premiums)  Insurance companies charge lower premiums to rich drivers who have accidents than to poor drivers who don't.  31 January 2013 (Last year's increase in wealth of the 100 richest)  Just the last year's increase in wealth of the 100 richest billionaires could lift everyone out of extreme poverty &mdash; with 3/4 left over.  31 January 2013 (Obama's night raids and cover-ups)  A documentary investigates Obama's night raids in Afghanistan, and covering up when civilians were killed.  31 January 2013 (Urgent: Save the sea turtles)  US citizens: Sea turtles in the US Atlantic may soon be wiped out because higher temperatures will mean all are born female. Call for action to curb global heating.  Earth's temperature has increased before, but the increase was slower, giving many species time to adapt.  31 January 2013 (Collection of obscure personal information)  In the past, information that was not strictly private was often hard to collect, and this obscurity was effectively a kind of privacy.  An article I won't link to (because of a coming paywall) points out that Facebook's graph search does not reduce privacy in the strict sense, but does attack the obscurity of much of the personal information on Facebook that isn't strictly private.  An even larger problem is that a state armed with digital surveillance will collect and index all the obscure personal information, totally eliminating obscurity. Internet surveillance will track all interpersonal communication, and face recognition will track all our physical movements, unless we organize politically to stop it.  31 January 2013 (Internet makes it easier to doubt religion)  The Internet makes it much easier to doubt religion, and helps people leave churches too.  However, in order for people to use the Internet safely to discuss leaving a powerful church, they need to be able to talk anonymously. This is one area in which the "real name" policies of Facebook and Google+ are dangerous.  I hesitate to predict that religion will disappear as a result. History has had lots of surprises and it could easily have more.  31 January 2013 (Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon combined employ only 150000)  Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon together give employment to only 150,000 people. Meanwhile, computers are eliminating large numbers of jobs and threaten to eliminate more.  In other words, high tech will never replace the jobs that computers eliminate.  Thus, society faces two possible futures. In one, people's livelihood will not depend on working. In the other, the rich will drive the unemployed into constantly greater suffering.  When I go to a store in the US that has self-checkout machines, I refuse to use them. I go near them and shout, "If you use these machines, you're putting Americans out of work." Then I join the line for a human sales clerk.  Please do as I do! By sacrificing a few minutes, you can stop a greedy corporation from increasing unemployment.  31 January 2013 (Urgent: End civil forfeiture)  US citizens: phone your congresscritter and call for an end to civil forfeiture. Also send mail through this page (which offers more information).  This problem developed as part of the War on Drugs, and can be seen as part of the harm that drug prohibition does to society.  The Capitol Switchboard numbers are 202-224-3121, 888-818-6641 and 888-355-3588.  31 January 2013 (World Bank's support for lumber business)  The World Bank's support for lumber business has amounted to a handout for the rich.  31 January 2013 (Blaming the poor for their poverty)  The fairy tale that blames the poor for their poverty is promoted by the rich that spread poverty.  31 January 2013 ("al Qa'ida")  Although Islamist extremists threaten violence and tyranny in Muslim regions, "al Qa'ida" as a global actor is moribund.  The various groups that use the name "al Qa'ida" are effectively independent and operate locally with their own aims.  What were you afraid of in 2004? In October 2001? I was afraid that the people who hate our freedoms, Bush and co., would take them away &mdash; they did. Now Obama is hammering the nails in the coffin of several essential human rights.  31 January 2013 (Former US-supported dictator to be tried for genocide)  The former US-supported dictator of Guatemala will be tried for genocide.  31 January 2013 (Urgent: Stop buying paper from Asian Pulp and Paper)  US citizens: tell KFC to stop buying paper from Asian Pulp and Paper.  30 January 2013 (Urgent: Ban pesticides that kill bees)  Everyone: call on the European Parliament to ban the pesticides that kill bees.  30 January 2013 (IMF promotes harmful policies across Europe)  New Paper Finds that the IMF is Promoting Socially and Economically Harmful Policies Broadly Across Europe.  Strangely, the one exception seems to be the UK, where the IMF has asked for less austerity.  30 January 2013 (International plutocracy)  The international plutocracy resembles a colonial elite: around the world, it feels no loyalty to whichever country it occupies.  30 January 2013 (Confederate general lionized)  Racist citizens of Memphis lionize Confederate general Forrest, who massacred Black Union troops who had surrendered.  30 January 2013 (Urgent: Call on Obama to pardon John Kiriakou)  US citizens: phone the White House and call on Obama to pardon John Kiriakou.  The White House comments line is 202-456-1111.  30 January 2013 (Chagossians to get another hearing in UN court)  The Chagossians, exiled in the 1960s for a US naval base, will get another hearing in a UN court thanks to Mauritius.  30 January 2013 (UK construction firms' blacklist)  UK construction firms conspired to blacklist environmental campaigners as well as union organizers and safety whistleblowers.  Will these companies be prosecuted?  30 January 2013 (Islamists in Mali burn library of ancient manuscripts)  Islamists in Mali, before leaving Timbuktu, burnt the library of ancient manuscripts.  Apparently they valued their own history not at all, and thought of it only as something westerners would mourn.  30 January 2013 (Widespread persecution of pregnant women)  Right-wing adoration of the fetus has led to widespread persecution of pregnant women, often imprisoning them, and in one case killing a woman through forced surgery that doctors warned would kill her.  30 January 2013 (Up to 30,000 drones to watch the US)  Up to 30,000 drones could be watching the US by 2020.  30 January 2013 (Mainstream US media says Obama too mean to Republicans)  Mainstream US media say Obama is too mean to Republicans.  Naturally Republicans call Obama a flaming Liberal &mdash; that is their standard verbal tactic. In the 70s and 80s they attributing to Liberals extremist views that hardly any real Liberals agreed with, so that the word "Liberal" seemed derogatory to many Americans. Then they turned it around and started calling anyone a "Liberal" who disagreed with them in any way. Even Obama, whose views are to the right of Nixon and would have been "moderate Republican" in the 70s.  30 January 2013 (Goldman Sachs profits from crop failures)  Goldman Sachs profits greatly from massive crop failures through food speculation.  30 January 2013 (Dept. of Homeland Security pushing for CISPA again)  The US Committee for Public Safety &mdash; oops, Department of Homeland Security &mdash; is pushing again for the CISPA law that was defeated last year.  The problem of vulnerability of infrastructure is real, and I am sure there are ways to improve their security without threatening ours. However, If there's one thing we can trust US "security" agencies to do, abusing their power is it.  The biggest threat to Americans on the Internet comes not from foreign governments but from the US government.  30 January 2013 (Berlusconi praises Mussolini)  Berlusconi il Ducino disclosed his true allegiance with praise of Mussolini.  30 January 2013 (Many Iranian journalists arrested)  Many Iranian journalists have been arrested, perhaps on suspicion of cooperating with foreign journalists.  Obama's war on journalism is leading is heading down the path which leads there.  30 January 2013 (Journalists, protesters arrested in Baku)  Journalists and other protesters for human rights were arrested in Baku, Azerbaijani.  If the Olympic games are held in Baku, at least they can't increase the repression beyond what is already there.  30 January 2013 (Warming of rural areas by city heat)  City heat warms large rural areas of North America.  This warming is not dangerous by itself, since it will not tend to increase while the cities stay around the same size. By contrast, if we keep pumping CO2 into the atmosphere at the same rate, global heating will increase with the CO2.  29 January 2013 (Islamists melting away in Mali)  France is quickly "winning" the war in Mali, but it seems that the Islamists are melting away rather than defeated.  Given that only a minority supports them, this could be sufficient, if Malians can keep the lid on them without continuing outside support. The drug trafficking cannot be stopped, and it would be idiotic to try. However, ending the War on Drugs would make it cease to be a big financial support for anyone.  29 January 2013 (Morsi's police crackdown over riots)  Morsi launched a police crackdown over riots that combine football hooliganism with protests against him.  29 January 2013 (22 Nepalese journalists flee)  22 Nepalese journalists flee after threats.  29 January 2013 (Hoax call radio hosts' show cancelled)  The hoax call radio hosts seem to have been unofficially punished with cancellation of their show.  I don't see anything wrong with that hoax call. It was not a threat or an attack. The overreaction of the nurse who took the call is not their fault.  29 January 2013 (Israeli soldiers shoot and kill unarmed Palestinians)  Israeli soldiers keep shooting unarmed Palestinians dead.  29 January 2013 (Our Dumb Democracy)  Our Dumb Democracy: Why the Untied States of Stupid Still Reins Supreem.  I presume the misspelling of "reigns supreme" is intentional.  29 January 2013 (Arbitrary arrest of Chinese dissidents)  Chinese dissidents have been arrested arbitrarily because of a government meeting.  29 January 2013 (Vietnam puts dissident in mental hospital)  Vietnam put a dissident in a mental hospital. Putting dissidents in mental hospitals was common practice in the Soviet Union.  29 January 2013 (Report from Egypt's fact-finding committee)  Egypt: Publish Fact-Finding Committee Report &mdash; Ensure Right to Truth for Victims of Police and Military Abuse.  29 January 2013 (Washington DC thugs ignore rape accusations)  Washington DC thugs simply ignore almost half of all rape accusations.  29 January 2013 (Wars over control of printing presses)  Comparing today's copyright war with the wars over control of printing presses.  29 January 2013 (Colombia rejects ban on breaking digital handcuffs)  Colombia's Supreme Court rejected the US-backed law that would have banned breaking digital handcuffs.  Please don't refer to digital handcuffs as "protection" measures &mdash; that whitewashes an evil.  29 January 2013 (Freedom to express unpopular views)  As freedom of speech is under threat across Europe, we must remember that its central point is the freedom to express views most people don't like.  29 January 2013 (FBI investigates officials and reporters for reporting on Stuxnet)  The FBI is using massive access to records of communications to investigate many officials and many reporters for reporting on the Stuxnet virus.  What we have come to is that investigation of secret US wars will have to be done by journalists outside the US, as was formerly necessary with the Soviet Union.  29 January 2013 (FCC plans to let Murdoch buy more newspapers)  The FCC is still planning to let Murdoch buy more newspapers. Public pressure made it hold off, but we have not won.  29 January 2013 (Israeli election)  Uri Avnery comments on the Israeli election: Netanyahu suffered a grave loss to center/left; he may still be prime minister, but he won't be as powerful as before.  29 January 2013 (Hungarian student protesters face punishment)  Hungarian student protesters face punishment by various "authorities".  29 January 2013 (US makes phone unlocking illegal)  The US has made it illegal to unlock a phone from a phone network.  Even worse, this will weaken popular resistance if US phone networks take steps against network neutrality, which the FCC has failed to defend for mobile phones.  The business model of selling hardware cheap, and making back the difference by restricting usage, leads generally to trashing users' freedom. Rather than prop it up with decisions like this, a good government would make it cease to work, so as to put an end to it.  29 January 2013 (Obama's inauguration speech)  Comparing Obama's inauguration speech with his record.  The US right-wing calls even small signs of disagreement "liberal" and shocking.  29 January 2013 (Urgent: strong Arms Trade Treaty)  US citizens: call for a strong Arms Trade Treaty.  29 January 2013 (Horsemeat in UK "beef" burgers from Poland)  Horsemeat in UK "beef" burgers came from a plant in Poland.  With so many more channels of trade, globalization greatly increases the opportunity for any sort of contamination, which might be with something really dangerous.  29 January 2013 (Google's secret tracking of browsing on iThings)  Google's secret tracking of browsing on iThings could give millions grounds to sue.  I think, however, that having the telephone network know what pages you visit is already too much surveillance; if a second company knows too, that's just a second reason to reject those devices.  28 January 2013 (Obama's War on Whistleblowers)  Since the US government routinely keeps many activities secret, whistleblowers are the only restraint on what it does. No wonder Obama is fighting a War on Whistleblowers.  28 January 2013 (Citizens of Barcelona demand apology from Italy)  Citizens of Barcelona demand an apology from Italy for Mussolini's bombing of that city.  28 January 2013 (Diesel fumes more dangerous than gasoline engine fumes)  Diesel fumes are more dangerous to health than gasoline engine fumes.  28 January 2013 (Aaron's Army)  Carl Malamud is looking for recruits for Aaron's Army.  28 January 2013 (US Senate makes minor changes in filibuster rules)  The US Senate made minor changes in filibuster rules, wasting the opportunity to stop Republicans from systematically blocking its activities.  I don't advocate eliminating filibusters entirely. I supported the campaign to make them take real work, so that senators would use them only when they feel very strongly.  28 January 2013 (Sierra Club endorses civil disobedience)  The Sierra Club has endorsed civil disobedience for the first time, because global heating is an urgent threat.  28 January 2013 (Financial transaction tax in euro-zone economy)  Most of the euro-zone economy has agreed in principle to adopt a financial transaction tax.  28 January 2013 (Chemicals most countries ban permitted in US foods)  Report: Chemicals Most Countries Ban Still Permitted in US Foods.  Fake ingredients are increasingly common in the US.  28 January 2013 (US navy ship runs aground on protected coral reef)  A US navy ship contemptuously entered protected Philippine waters, disregarding a warning, then ran aground on a UNESCO-recognized coral reef.  The ship may be salvaged but I am not sure the coral reef is salvageable.  28 January 2013 (Progressive talk by Obama)  Progressives and progressive organizations must not overestimate the value of a little progressive talk by Obama.  Obama has a history of smearing progressives that ask him to keep his promises.  If Obama does something progressive, I will say he acted rightly on that occasion. I will say I was pleasantly surprised. But I won't expect a lot of such surprises.  28 January 2013 (UK gov't cutting funds for school sports)  The UK government is cutting funds for school sports, thus cancelling out one of the few benefits the London Olympics were supposed to provide to the UK people.  The Olympic games leave in their wake surveillance, repression, and public debt. In exchange, they give the people brief entertainment, which most will only see on TV, just as if the games had been held somewhere far away. It's a screw and a swindle, promoted by the businesses that hope to gain from it.  If you live in Madrid, Istanbul or Tokyo, don't wait &mdash; organize now to defeat your city's bid to hold the Olympic games.  28 January 2013 (Expected long-term temperature rise)  The Stern review in 2006 expected long-term temperature rise of 2 or 3 C, but the author says we are now on track for 4 degrees C.  28 January 2013 (Iraqi gov't army shoots protesters in Falluja)  The Shi'ite-dominated Iraqi government army shot protesters in Falluja who attacked an army road block that was set up to block a protest march.  It is interesting that Muqtada al-Sadr supports the Sunnis who oppose Al-Maliki. Al-Sadr always resisted hatred between Sunnis and Shi'ites.  28 January 2013 ("Job piracy")  "Job piracy" is when states offer special deals to companies to get them to move jobs from other states.  Through this practice one state may gain a little while another loses more. If the US government were not dominated by businesses, it would prohibit states from competing for businesses with special deals.  28 January 2013 (Egyptian football fans sentenced to death)  Egyptian football fans rioted after some of them were sentenced to death on account of a previous football riot, in which people were killed by a stampede against a locked gate.  Death sentences for human beings are unconscionable, but it sounds like those sentenced this time did not commit murder.  28 January 2013 (Mainstream media exaggerate division on abortion rights)  US mainstream media exaggerate how much the US is divided on abortion rights.  I think they generally exaggerate the strength of right wing views.  28 January 2013 (Right-wing criticism of Hugo Chavez)  A paradigmatic example of the unfair right-wing criticism of Hugo Chavez: condemning him for making an abandoned skyscraper available for poor people to live in.  I criticize some of Chavez's policies that violate human rights, but I wholeheartedly support these policies. The US ought to follow his example in helping the poor.  28 January 2013 (Ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu must be protected)  The ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu must be protected from the fighting in Mali.  The invasion of Iraq resulted in destruction of precious archaeological sites, which wiped out information of civilization's beginnings, as well as the looting of the National Museum of Iraq because no one bothered to protect it.  28 January 2013 (Even banksters oppose UK austerity policies)  Even banksters oppose the UK austerity policies.  I suppose that what they gain by taking from the poor, to give to the rich, is less than what they lose by economic shrinkage.  28 January 2013 (Pentagon censors repetition of published information)  The Pentagon continues to censor repetition of information already published, calling it "secret".  28 January 2013 (US lobbying against enhancing privacy protection)  The US is lobbying against enhancing privacy protection in the EU.  I have no sympathy for companies whose business model is based on surveillance. They should set up a way people can pay anonymously for services.  28 January 2013 (Aaron Tobey permitted to sue)  Aaron Tobey, who was held by airport thugs for having text from the Fourth Amendment written on his chest, will be permitted to sue.  28 January 2013 (Yahoo joins Google in demanding search warrants)  Yahoo has joined Google in demanding search warrants for handing over users' email.  27 January 2013 (Urgent: Halt use of pesticides tied to death of bees)  US citizens: call on the EPA to halt use of the pesticides tied to the death of bees.  27 January 2013 (Russia's congress votes to ban Gay Pride parades)  Russia's congress voted to ban Gay Pride parades, calling them "homosexual propaganda", as religious fanatics attacked protesters with impunity.  Distributing information on homosexuality to minors is also banned, which probably means all publication is censored since there would be no way to deny the information to minors.  27 January 2013 (Americans do not consider public libraries obsolete)  Americans do not consider public libraries obsolete.  27 January 2013 (Starving refugees in the UK)  A penniless refugee in the UK was caught stealing food to eat. Then the security guard attacked him, and he fought back, fearing injury.  Modern societies, dominated by the rich, consider a large fraction of citizens superfluous, and refugees even more so. People who are starving when surrounded by plentiful food have a right to take it and eat it.  27 January 2013 (Violent threat to women in the US military)  The US will now allow women into combat jobs, but the biggest violent threat to women in the US military is sexual assault.  27 January 2013 (Child labor among Apple's suppliers)  Apple found 106 cases of child labor among its suppliers.  Since it was Apple itself that found them, I won't condemn Apple for them directly. I suppose Apple did not specifically ask for these children to be hired, or for the other abuses listed in the article.  However, the use of multiple layers of subcontractors invites these abuses, and more, by creating price pressure that impels them, and making it hard for either the ultimate seller or unions or laws to prevent them.  Subcontracting is central to the evils of today's manufacturing.  27 January 2013 (Misogyny)  Relating misogyny to other structural problems of our society.  27 January 2013 (Clash between two versions of Hinduism)  The clash between two versions of Hinduism.  Women are not the only victims of conservative Hinduism. Dalits and tribals are frequently attacked, raped or killed.  27 January 2013 (Unprivileged Americans' life expectancy falls)  Life expectancy for some categories of Americans &mdash; unprivileged ones &mdash; fell from 1990 to 2008.  I would expect it has fallen further since then. Obamacare might help counteract this, to the extent that it gets them some medical coverage.  27 January 2013 (Urgent: Firm action to stop global heating)  US citizens: sign this letter calling on Obama to take firm action to stop global heating.  27 January 2013 (Larry Breuer steps down from Dept. of Justice)  Larry Breuer, who let banksters off the hook without prosecution, is stepping down from the Department of Justice after a media investigation showed how little he had tried.  This kid-gloves treatment of a big company contrasts with throwing the book at hactivists.  27 January 2013 (Urgent: Protect indigenous people from oil extraction)  US citizens: call on President Correa of Ecuador to protect an indigenous people in Amazonia from oil extraction.  27 January 2013 (UK MP accused of "anti-semitism")  A UK MP commented on the irony of oppression of Palestinians by Jews who had fled Nazi oppression, and now faces accusations of "anti-semitism".  I think he erred in speaking of what "the Jews" did, as if "the Jews" were a single corporate body rather than an ethnic group of millions of people. Notwithstanding that, his statement is basically accurate. Since he says he did not mean it as criticism of all Jews, I think it would be a mistake to let that locution distract attention from the valid point.  27 January 2013 (UK conservatives want to destroy environmental protection)  If the EU does not destroy its environmental protection laws, UK conservatives threaten to take Britain out of the EU so they can destroy environmental protection locally.  27 January 2013 (TechCrunch stops making people use Facebook)  User rejection pushed TechCrunch to stop making people use Facebook to post comments.  This is a small victory. Nasty comments are unpleasant and add nothing, but surveillance a la Facebook is worse than merely unpleasant.  27 January 2013 (Quinoa)  The complex market situation of quinoa.  27 January 2013 (Thousands protest in Egypt against Morsi)  Thousands protested in Egypt against Morsi, and thugs fought with them all day.  27 January 2013 (Marxism respectable again)  The new oppression of today's capitalism is making Marxism respectable again, now that people have ceased to associate it with Communist dictatorship.  27 January 2013 (Obama still pushing for REAL-ID plan)  Obama is still pushing the REAL-ID plan for more information about Americans, and may be threatening to crack down on states a few at a time.  27 January 2013 (John Kiriakou sentenced to 2.5 years in prison)  John Kiriakou was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison.  Supposedly this is for mentioning another CIA agent's name to a reporter who did not print it. Really it's for exposing CIA torture, and demonstrates how they can find charges to lay against anyone when they try hard enough.  This is one answer to the question, "Why should you mind surveillance if you didn't do anything wrong?"  26 January 2013 (French and Malian troops advance)  French and Malian troops are advancing rapidly.  This could mean that the rebels are being beaten, but they could be dispersing following usual guerrilla tactics. If the government recaptures the main towns, only time will tell how much that really means.  Mali was not entirely tranquil in the past. Demanding that it become entirely tranquil in the future may be too strict a standard for judging the results.  26 January 2013 (Striking workers in Greece threatened with imprisonment)  The Greek government claims to have "conscripted" striking metro workers and says it will imprison them if they do not resume work.  I hope that the workers have the courage to go to prison rather than surrender.  26 January 2013 (Destruction of Great Barrier Reef)  'Shameful': UNESCO Warns Australia Over Destruction of Great Barrier Reef.  26 January 2013 (Urgent: Letter to Obama about global heating)  US citizens: sign this letter to Obama about global heating.  26 January 2013 (UN investigating US and Israeli drone attacks)  The UN has launched its investigation into the US and Israeli drone attacks.  26 January 2013 (Touareg prisoners killed by Mali's army)  Mali's army has killed Touareg prisoners in several places.  In addition to being wrong, this will obstruct a diplomatic agreement with the Touaregs who want to negotiate.  26 January 2013 (Andrew Auemheimer)  Andrew Auernheimer faces the prison term Aaron Swartz might have got.  We should campaign for him as well as for Swartz.  It is regrettable that the article uses the words "hacking" and "hacker" to refer to breaking computer security.  26 January 2013 (EU's carbon emission trading system failing)  The EU's carbon emission trading system is failing because the price of emissions is so low that it does not encourage conservation.  To result in conservation, the amount of emissions permitted must decrease fast enough to keep the price up.  26 January 2013 (Iran's efforts to discredit exiled journalists)  Iran goes to extreme lengths to discredit exiled journalists.  This includes fake Facebook accounts, and threats against their families.  26 January 2013 (Twitter exposes itself to EU libel laws)  By having an office in Ireland, Twitter has exposed itself to EU libel laws and to outright censorship as well.  The issue affects Facebook and Google+ also, but you should not use Facebook or Google+ for other reasons.  26 January 2013 (Discount "beef" hamburger meat)  Discount "beef" hamburger meat is not regular chopped meat at a lower price. It purpose-made with lots of fat and additives.  26 January 2013 (Commonly used pesticides toxic to frogs)  Commonly used pesticides, used in the normal way, are very toxic to frogs.  25 January 2013 (Plastic microbeads in fish near English coast)  1/3 of the fish near part of the English coast have ingested plastic microbeads. These don't endanger humans, but being so prevalent, could stunt the growth of the fish.  25 January 2013 ("Big Food" in Nutrition Association)  Report: 'Big Food' Infiltrates Nutrition Association.  25 January 2013 (Sea level rise due to global heating)  Previous natural episodes of global heating raised sea level by 30 feet, and perhaps more.  25 January 2013 (Nuclear Regulatory Commission ignored warning)  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was warned in 2007 of the danger of the sort of meltdown that happened at Fukushima, but did not act to protect US nuclear plants.  25 January 2013 (Deactivating silo-based nuclear missiles)  Deactivating silo-based nuclear missiles is a way to reduce the chance of accidental nuclear war.  25 January 2013 (Many single mothers among anti-abortionists)  In the US, conservative Christians who reject abortion have lots single mothers. It looks like their anti-abortionism backfires against their "family values".  If this increases US population growth, it is very bad for the world as a whole, since Americans consume so much.  25 January 2013 (Mercenary companies cut off accountability)  Mercenary companies, also known as military contractors, cut off accountability for both money and conduct of war.  25 January 2013 (When trees die, people die)  When trees die, people die.  25 January 2013 (Drug-resistant bacteria)  Drug research is not working on new antibiotics, so resistant bacteria could kill large numbers of people.  25 January 2013 (Lung disease in children growing up near highways)  Building a new highway through a neighborhood can cause substantial amounts of lung disease for children growing up there.  It follows that electric cars have yet another advantage, and so does good mass transit.  25 January 2013 (Airlines won't pay EU carbon tax)  Calculations suggest airlines made over a billion dollars collecting surcharges that far more than covered the EU's tax on their fuel &mdash; which they ultimately got out of paying.  The crucial point is that airlines would have no trouble if they did indeed have to pay this tax. Shame on the EU for backing down, and double shame on US politicians for opposing a tax that is obviously necessary.  25 January 2013 (South African farm workers on strike)  South African farm workers say, don't buy wine or fruit from South Africa.  25 January 2013 (Dissident Sombath Somphone missing)  The government of Laos says it doesn't know what happened to dissident Sombath Somphone after he was stopped by thugs at a checkpoint.  25 January 2013 (Land reform in Zimbabwe a success)  Mugabe's land reform in Zimbabwe was ultimately a success.  25 January 2013 (Thugs attack Kenyan journalists)  Kenyan journalists were attacked by thugs who stole their cameras. They dared cover a riot.  25 January 2013 (What would George Orwell say?)  What George Orwell would say about UK plans for secret evidence and universal Internet surveillance.  25 January 2013 (Steve Jobs tried to pressure Palm into illegal pact)  Steve Jobs threatened Palm with a patent suit to pressure Palm into an illegal pact not to hire employees away from Apple.  I like imagining a world in which the US government enforced laws vigorously against the powerful; this could have landed Jobs in prison.  24 January 2013 (UN to investigate US drone attacks)  The UN will investigate US drone attacks.  24 January 2013 (Why US military force authorization does not cover Mali)  Why the US 2001 military force authorization does not cover Mali.  24 January 2013 (US ISPs' plan to punish users for sharing)  The US ISPs' plan to punish users for sharing may wipe out free WiFi networks in the US.  24 January 2013 (Obama's "new rules" for remote assassination)  Obama's "new rules" for remote assassination are supposed to count as "due process of law". It appears that neither the public nor senators will be allowed to see these rules, so they signify nothing but spin. The secret rule might say "Chant eeny-meeny-miny-mo... as you proceed around a circle of cards representing dissidents, and where the chant ends, kill that one." The secret rule might say, "In Mali, kill the target with light skin."  But even if we could see the rules, and judge how much they try to be legitimate, it is hard to justify condemning people to death without a trial not on a battlefield.  24 January 2013 (Obama's war on medical marijuana)  In Obama's war on medical marijuana, state-licensed growers are imprisoned for having guns to protect their crops from theft.  Note the creative twisting of the law involved in saying that having armed guards on the premises solely to prevent crime consists of "using a gun" in the drug sales. It reminds me of the charges against Aaron Swartz. It is mean-spirited of Obama even to try to prosecute these people, using them as pawns in a jurisdictional squabble.  Maybe the growers would do better in court if they hired off-duty state thugs to keep thieves away. Federal prosecutors might have a harder time convicting the growers for that; it is fun to imagine the conversation with the thug on the witness stand. "Why were you present at the store with your gun?" "As a police officer I always carry my gun when on private duty." "What duty were you hired to do there?" "Discourage breaking of state laws at the store."  24 January 2013 (Pentagon can't keep track of spending)  The Pentagon (and its contractors) says cuts in military spending will be unbearable, but they can't keep track of what they are spending now, so how could they know?  24 January 2013 (Facebook's graph search)  Facebook's graph search puts many users in danger.  More details.  Keep in mind that Facebook has access to this information regardless of privacy settings, and (thanks to the PAT RIOT Act) Big Brother has access to all of it too.  24 January 2013 (Morocco to repeal law forcing rape victims to marry rapists)  Morocco plans to repeal the law that forces rape victims to marry their rapists.  The fault is in the patriarchal idea behind the law, which treats unmarried women as property of their families.  24 January 2013 (Thugs attack photographer for taking photos)  The founder of photographyisnotacrime.com was attacked and choked by security guards, for taking photos.  24 January 2013 (Facebook invents phony "likes")  Did the vegetarian Facebook user really "like" MacDonalds, or did Facebook make it up? In fact, Facebook invents phony "likes", and worse, falsely suggests people liked specific text that they had never even seen.  24 January 2013 (Lessig's rebuke to prosecutor Ortiz)  Lessig's rebuke to prosecutor Ortiz.  24 January 2013 (Raped Afghan girl sent to shelter, gets raped at shelter)  An Afghan girl who secured conviction of her rapist was sent to a shelter. The employees there raped her.  24 January 2013 (Bangladesh's annual flooding pattern)  Bangladesh's annual flooding pattern, the basis for its system of agriculture, has changed with devastating results.  If out-of-season floods continue, it will probably mean that global heating is at work.  24 January 2013 (Prison for criticizing fictional character)  A Thai editor was sentenced to 10 years in prison for an article criticizing a fictional character considered to stand for the king.  24 January 2013 (Web protesters face felony charges)  The participants in sit-ins faced small fines, but modern equivalents, participants in virtual Anonymous web protests, face felony charges.  24 January 2013 (Urgent: Priority to curbing global heating in State of the Union)  US citizens: call on Obama to give high priority to curbing global heating in the State of the Union address.  24 January 2013 (Urgent: Divest from companies that profit from Israeli occupation)  CREF members: file a motion to divest from companies that profit from the Israeli occupation of Palestine.  24 January 2013 (Greenpeace estimates fossil fuel emissions)  Greenpeace says giant fossil fuel projects will increase world emissions by 20%.  24 January 2013 (Mackerel fishing at unsustainable level)  As a result partly of global heating, mackerel fishing has increased to an unsustainable level.  24 January 2013 (Obama must confront decision about pipeline)  Obama must now confront the decision about the planet-roaster pipeline. But he doesn't want to confront it soon.  24 January 2013 (Republicans criticize Obama)  Republicans criticize Obama for not offering them any concessions in his inaugural speech.  I don't know whether it's true &mdash; I had no reason to read the speech &mdash; but if so, it's a step in the right direction. Today's Republicans see compromise as a sign of weakness.  23 January 2013 (US gov't puts pregnant women in danger)  Pregnant women in the US face the danger of arrest and prosecution, and even death, in the name of protecting fetuses.  I think it would in principle be legitimate to penalize actions likely to cause a baby to be born with serious defects. However, I don't see any need for such a law in practice. Very few women will intentionally try to have damaged babies, so there is no point prohibiting that.  Perhaps the state should do more to encourage abortion of fetuses that are clearly going to have irreparable birth defects. However, there is no need to get punitive about it.  I would expect that the main way that women do damage their babies is by using tobacco or alcohol; but they mainly do this because they can't stop, and the way to reduce this is with help, not threats.  23 January 2013 (Recognition of Palestine as a state)  In terms of international law, Palestine has been recognized as a state. The fact that it does not have control of its territory makes a big difference in practice but doesn't negate its recognition.  23 January 2013 (Iraq war "surge" myth)  Hagel is under pressure to confirm the Iraq war "surge" myth.  23 January 2013 (Demand for soybeans comes from feeding cattle)  Don't blame vegetarians for all the demand for soybeans. Most of the demand comes from feeding cattle.  23 January 2013 (Arrest of Shoshana Hebshi based on her name)  Shoshana Hebshi will sue various governments for arresting her based on her name.  23 January 2013 (Urgent: Fight voter suppression and disenfranchisement)  US citizens: call on Obama to give priority to fighting voter suppression and disenfranchisement.  23 January 2013 (Grave flaws in Mega cyber-locker service)  It looks like the Mega cyber-locker service will have two grave flaws.  The encryption and decryption are done inside Mega's server. That means the server can save a copy of the unencrypted file without telling you. If you want encryption to give you security, you must do the encryption yourself, on your own computer, with a free/libre program. And later, do the decryption likewise.  A second apparent problem is that the service will require you to run nontrivial Javascript code.  Either of these problems means you shouldn't touch it.  23 January 2013 (Ethiopia forcing a million families into villages)  Ethiopia is forcing a million families to move into villages, and turning their land over to foreign companies.  23 January 2013 (UK's standard for undercover thugs)  The UK's standard for undercover thugs is not really the same as James Bond. It's much worse.  23 January 2013 (Olivine dust could absorb CO2 from ocean)  Dropping olivine dust in the ocean could absorb CO2 and counter acidification. But it creates another danger to the oceans: it could change the balance of species. It would be worth trying as an emergency measure, but we should take action now to reduce CO2 emissions so we don't get there.  23 January 2013 (The war in Mali)  Background to the war in Mali.  23 January 2013 (Vatican hides wealth behind holding companies)  The Vatican hides a billion dollars worth of real estate behind multiple layers of holding companies. They got the money from Mussolini.  23 January 2013 (Chinese workers take bosses prisoner to protest)  Chinese workers took their bosses prisoner in the factory to protest nasty work rules.  23 January 2013 (Japanese minister calls on old people to die)  A Japanese minister called on old people to "hurry up and die" to save the state money.  US Republicans have the same idea when they propose cutting Social Security and Medicare, and with their death panel of governors who blocked expansion of Medicaid in their states.  23 January 2013 (Privacy on the Internet)  The ACLU agrees that not only children deserve privacy on the Internet.  23 January 2013 (US school-to-prison pipeline)  Criminalizing minor school misbehavior in parts of the US has produced a school-to-prison pipeline.  More about the danger caused by having thugs in a school.  23 January 2013 (Obama talks about ending "perpetual war")  Obama talks about ending "perpetual war", but he intends to end only the most overt aspects of it.  23 January 2013 (How MIT started prosecution of Aaron Swartz)  How MIT started the prosecution of Aaron Swartz.  I see, behind these events, the strains caused by the restriction of access to scientific literature, practiced by JSTOR on behalf of the journal publishers.  What we need is to implement free scientific publishing.  23 January 2013 (Barring domestic spying by the US military)  Ex-Army Officer Accuses CIA of Obstructing Pre-9/11 Intelligence-Gathering.  Barring domestic spying by the military is a good policy, and it seems to me that the fault was the failure to fully and properly transfer the operation to an appropriate civilian police agency such as the FBI.  23 January 2013 (Torture and disappearances in Afghan jails)  UN Report Finds Torture, Disappearances in Afghan Jails.  23 January 2013 (Worship of the invisible hand)  The Extremist Cult of Capitalism.  I call it the worship of the invisible hand.  23 January 2013 (Martin Luther King Was a Radical, Not a Saint)  Martin Luther King Was a Radical, Not a Saint.  23 January 2013 (Asthma attacks in children reduced in England)  Banning smoking in public places in England led to a 20% decrease in asthma attacks in children, evidently because the smoke caused attacks before.  23 January 2013 (Turkish gov't demands ancient artifacts)  The government of Turkey demands return of ancient artifacts while destroying archaeological sites.  I don't think there is any importance in returning artifacts to countries from which they were removed long ago. What is important is to properly excavate sites so that humanity gets the information they contain about human past.  23 January 2013 (Decisions about global heating Obama must make)  Five crucial decisions with which Obama will tackle global heating or surrender to it.  23 January 2013 (Student expelled after reporting security flaw)  Ahmed al-Khabaz reported a security flaw in his school's student information system, and when he later tried to verify they had fixed it, he was threatened with prosecution and expelled from school.  If it were in the US, I would expect him to sue the school.  22 January 2013 (Push to reverse Corporations United decision)  The push to reverse the Corporations United decision is gaining strength.  22 January 2013 (Americans' health)  Compared with 17 other industrialised countries, Americans' health is worst.  22 January 2013 (Urgent: Oppose fracking for natural gas export)  US citizens: submit a comment against fracking to export natural gas.  22 January 2013 (Urgent: Aaron's Law)  US citizens: support the campaign to prevent repeats of the prosecution of Aaron Swartz.  22 January 2013 (Record-setting Australian heat wave)  The Australian heat wave has set a record for breadth and intensity combined.  22 January 2013 (MLK's condemnation of US militarism)  Remember Martin Luther King's condemnation of US militarism.  22 January 2013 (7 ways for Obama to earn his Nobel Peace Prize)  7 Ways for Obama to Really Earn that Nobel Peace Prize.  22 January 2013 (Human rights lawyers arrested in Turkey)  15 human rights lawyers were arrested in Turkey.  22 January 2013 (European Food Safety Authority on imidacloprid)  The European Food Safety Authority concluded that imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid pesticide) should be used only on crops that honeybees don't visit.  Other bees are important too; I am not sure whether there are any crops that other bees visit but honeybees don't.  22 January 2013 (Capture of Algerian natural gas plant)  The capture of the Algerian natural gas plant may have been planned before French intervention in Mali.  22 January 2013 (Aaron Swartz and internet freedom)  Aaron Swartz: cannon fodder in the war on internet freedom.  22 January 2013 (Desperation of the hungry in Saharan Africa)  Global heating contributes to the desperation of the hungry in Saharan Africa, where the current choice of desperate move is Islamic fanaticism.  In such an unstable situation, any local change has a chance of provoking violence there or in related areas. Gaddafi's defeat in Libya had such an effect in Mali, but if he had defeated the rebels, that could have provoked violence somewhere else. And since the source of the instability is various kinds of pressures that increase on their own, trying to keep everything from changing won't avoid violence either.  However, on the longer term, reducing the pressures could have a positive effect.  22 January 2013 (Malian army tortures and kills unarmed prisoners)  The Malian army has tortured and killed unarmed prisoners from northern ethnic groups. The Islamists also have carried out grave crimes against human rights.  In a city likely to be attacked at any time, arresting suspected infiltrators is justified, but that should not mean killing them.  22 January 2013 (Obama developing new rules for assassination)  Obama is developing new rules for assassination, but CIA attacks in Pakistan will not be covered by them.  If these new rules are secret, or involve killings away from battlefields, they will remain unacceptable.  22 January 2013 (Business donations at Obama's inauguration)  Obama's inauguration ceremony invited businesses to make large donations.  I'm sure most of the "donors" expect they are buying something more than just tickets to a ceremony.  22 January 2013 (UK gov't secrecy about 1972 workers' strike)  The UK government is keeping papers secret about striking workers that believe they were falsely accused in 1972 for political reasons.  I wonder why Labour governments did not reinvestigate and/or publish these papers.  22 January 2013 (Secret sites used for torture of Afghan detainees)  U.N. report finds torture of Afghan detainees, secret sites.  22 January 2013 (Bahraini thugs attack woman)  Bahrain Police Attack on Woman Stirs Anger.  22 January 2013 (Google's withdrawal of censorship warning in China)  China: Google's Quiet Withdrawal of Censorship Warning Raises Questions.  22 January 2013 (Urgent: Stop Shell's Arctic drilling)  US citizens: tell Obama to stop Shell's Arctic drilling.  22 January 2013 (MIT student threatened with lawsuit by Microsoft)  An MIT student was threatened with a lawsuit by Microsoft, and not supported at all by MIT.  22 January 2013 (UK horsemeat scandal)  The UK's horsemeat scandal shows that EU-proposed further cutbacks in food inspection will open the door to pathogens in meat. The old British idea of  fair play is dead; the approach now is to get away with as much as you can.  Thus, letting UK business "police itself" is simply a way to let business get away with shafting people, in between occasional scandals. The  LIBOR scandal shows where that leads.  21 January 2013 (Article: Why internet music "sale" is a bad deal)  Why internet music "sale" is a bad deal.  21 January 2013 (Venezuelan oppositionist accused of "terrorism")  A Venezuelan oppositionist was accused of "terrorism" and his home was raided because he allegedly claimed on Twitter that Chavez is in a coma. They seized his computers, apparently on the pretext of looking for proof he was the one who made the tweet. A little more, in Spanish, confirming he was accused of terrorism.  Whatever he said about Chavez, and whether it is true or not, saying it is not terrorism. If he presents it as fact and has no evidence, that could be dishonest; but if he presents it as a suspicion, that cannot be called dishonest.  Either way, it is no grounds for the state to seize his computers.  21 January 2013 (Reject restrictive scientific publishing)  Scientists should firmly reject restrictive scientific publishing, and not back down.  Why I call it free scientific publishing and not "open access".  21 January 2013 (Islamists in Mali)  Islamists in Mali took advantage of an opportunity created by decades of bad governance.  The national borders of Africa were drawn by colonial powers a hundred years ago and in many cases have no relation to the ethnic groups. Perhaps it doesn't make sense for the north of Mali to be in the same country as the south.  That doesn't change the validity of supporting Malians against the Islamists, but it could make a big difference to establishing peace afterwards.  21 January 2013 (Preservation of the Yasuni forest)  The Yasuni forest may have the most unknown species of any region in the world, and Ecuador wants to preserve it, but there is pressure to extract oil and destroy it.  To avoid global heating disaster, we need to leave 4/5 of the world's fossil fuels in the ground. There is no reason that shouldn't include what's under the Yasuni forest.  21 January 2013 (Cheap "beef" burgers in the UK)  Adulteration of cheap "beef" burgers in the UK was caused by an economic system in which the supermarkets pressure producers into cutting corners, together with the rising world price of beef.  The rising price of beef has good effects. It will encourage many people to eat less meat, and thus help their health, as well as reduce their burden on the Earth. Unfortunately, if the price is rising because more people want to eat beef, then production is probably going up, so the total burden is increasing.  We need to stop feeding cattle on farmed crops and limit them to the number that can be supported eating grass.  21 January 2013 (US accused of interfering in Israeli election)  Israeli officials accuse the US of interfering in the Israeli election.  This is news because it is "man bites dog". Everyone is used to Israeli interference in US elections.  21 January 2013 (Florida mixing religion and school)  Florida has tried to reconcile religion in schools with the US constitution by letting students choose any sort of religion. Satanists celebrate the new opportunity to proselytize.  I think Satanists ought to have the same rights as any other religious group, but I am not sure many students would invite them.  21 January 2013 (Urgent: Oppose attempts to rig electoral college)  US citizens: sign this petition to oppose Republican attempts to rig the electoral college via rigged congressional districts.  21 January 2013 (Rich executives that want to cut Social Security)  Rich executives that want to cut Social Security are connected with companies that lobby to preserve their own government benefits.  Note the exaggeration in their claims about problems in Social Security. Retirement in your 60s hardly means a 25-year career.  However, perhaps we need to make a 25-year career normal, if technology means there will be no jobs for a large fraction of the working-age population.  21 January 2013 (US unemployment figures)  US unemployment figures don't count the people who would wish they could have a job but have given up on looking for one. Paradoxically, shortened unemployment benefits cause people to give up sooner and thus reduces the official unemployment rate, without really improving the employment situation.  21 January 2013 (Trillion-dollar coin)  Although a trillion-dollar coin is a gimmick, it would also return to the practice of creating money without boosting the income of the banks.  21 January 2013 (Prosecutor of Aaron Swartz tries to justify herself)  The prosecutor of Aaron Schwartz tried to justify herself. This shows what she said and why it is bogus.  21 January 2013 (Bubble-shooting 5-year-old "terrorist")  A 5-year-old was called a "terrorist" by her kindergarten for threatening to shoot another child with a bubble gun.  If the school officials had misunderstood what she said, this would be a mere error, and it would have been corrected by now. Clearly they really believe that threatening to shoot a soap bubble at someone must be punished.  21 January 2013 (EMI taking down videos of I Have a Dream)  EMI is taking down videos of I Have a Dream on behalf of Martin Luther King's heirs.  21 January 2013 (Prison sentence for criticizing Thai king)  A Thai political organizer was sentenced to prison for criticizing a man he said he did not dare identify.  The judge decided that could only mean the king, and I think he is right about that. But it's ironic that the decision effectively acknowledges that the king practices censorship that Thais hate. I wonder if reporting of this court decision will be punished as criticism of the king.  21 January 2013 (Danger of Keystone XL pipeline recognized)  Recognition is spreading that the Keystone XL pipeline must be stopped precisely because it would lead to extraction of lots of tar sands oil.  21 January 2013 (US adviser in support of Arab tyrants)  A right-wing US adviser openly called for the US to back Arab tyrants, and his arguments are logically invalid.  The US sometimes supports freedom and democracy around the world. However, it often supports tyrants. How should we respond?  I think we should condemn the US when it works against freedom and democracy, and praise the US when it works for them. The US often does wrong, but that doesn't mean it's automatically wrong even when it does right.  21 January 2013 (Obama continues attack on marijuana dispensers)  Obama continues to attack state-licensed medical marijuana dispensers.  21 January 2013 (Urgent: Compensation for disabled Colombian GM workers)  US citizens: call on GM to meet with and compensate its disabled Colombian workers.  21 January 2013 (US blocks air and sea smuggling of drugs)  The US has blocked air and sea smuggling of drugs from South America, so shipments now come by land, which is causing violence in Guatemala.  21 January 2013 (The wealth of billionaires)  Oxfam says that the wealth of billionaires is the other side of world poverty.  20 January 2013 (Amazon bypasses UK credit card consumer protection)  Amazon's complex financial arrangements bypass UK credit card consumer protection.  20 January 2013 (Feminism and trans women)  Feminism shouldn't be about telling trans women they're not female enough.  20 January 2013 (Aaron Was a Criminal and So Are You)  Aaron Was a Criminal and So Are You.  20 January 2013 (Africa's water)  Water Grabbing to Follow Food Speculation in Africa?  20 January 2013 (Identifying people by genetic sequences)  Given someone's genetic sequence, it is easy to find out the person's identity.  20 January 2013 (Anti-surveillance fashion)  Anti-surveillance fashion.  20 January 2013 (Advertising gets priority over privacy)  Ministers of EU countries give targeted advertising priority over Internet users' privacy.  Neelie Kroes yields to operator pressure and sacrifices network neutrality.  The proposed "right to be forgotten" could be a good thing when applied to data in business data bases about people, but must not apply to your diary or your blog.  20 January 2013 (Kim Dotcom's cyberlocker site)  Kim Dotcom makes his new cyberlocker site an opportunity to condemn the War on Sharing.  It is a mistake to use the term "cloud computing", because it means too many different things. "Cloud storage", by contrast, is concrete enough to be a meaningful term &mdash; and it is safe to use, provided you encrypt the data on your own computer with free software before you upload it, and decrypt it on your own computer with free software after you download it.  Use encryption performed on a remote server or with nonfree software is best described as "clown storage".  20 January 2013 (Review of Shell's Arctic drilling plans)  Obama announced a review of Shell's Arctic drilling plans.  This is a step that might lead to a victory, but we have to keep the pressure on.  20 January 2013 (UK's standard of acceptable police conduct)  The UK has adopted the James Bond standard of acceptable police conduct.  20 January 2013 (UK gov't refuses opportunity to stimulate economy)  The UK government stubbornly refuses to stimulate the economy with investment in renewable energy.  20 January 2013 (Mentally ill dumped into US prisons)  US prison: back to the 19th century for the mentally ill.  We can trace this to two causes. One is financial pressure on prisons, due to the US practice of imprisoning too many people, squeezing against the fact that the rich have more or less escaped from taxation. Extraction of money from privatized prisons may contribute too.  The other is a vindictive attitude toward prisoners, which has (among other things) got rid of rehabilitation as a serious goal in prison. Sure, prisoners are being punished, and for some fraction of them there is good reason for this. (Many are merely victims of the War on Drugs.) However, imprisoning someone should not mean seeking to inflict the worst possible suffering. Such cruelty is not necessary to deter others, totally irrelevant to keeping a dangerous person away from us, and not the best way to reduce recidivism when the prisoner is released. It could well have the opposite effect.  20 January 2013 (TSA getting rid of X-ray scanners)  The TSA is getting rid of X-ray scanners, but not because of the danger that a software mishap could expose a person to an overdose of radiation.  20 January 2013 (Fallout from Fukushima meltdown)  Fish loaded with radioactive cesium show that fallout from the Fukushima meltdown continues seeping into the ocean.  19 January 2013 (FBI's methods of massive surveillance)  After the Supreme Court limited use of GPS trackers without a warrant, the FBI is performing massive surveillance in other ways and keeping the methods secret.  19 January 2013 (Algerian troops free hostages)  Algerian troops stormed the gas installation that had been taken over by Islamists, and freed most of the hostages.  Some hostages were killed. I don't blame the soldiers for that; perfection is too much to ask.  19 January 2013 (UK gov't gives companies privileged access to ministers)  The UK government doesn't sell selling privileged access to ministers, no siree! For companies that are big enough, it gives away privileged access.  19 January 2013 (Killing wolves)  In Canada and Russia, killing wolves is a ploy to disguise harm humans are doing to wildlife.  19 January 2013 (Lack of rain in the Amazon)  A large part of the Amazon rain forest has had a lack of rain for 8 years, due apparently to global heating. Large trees are dying.  19 January 2013 (UK gov't fails to detect meat adulteration)  Austerity typically includes firing government inspectors for various sorts of things. The UK has cut back on food inspection, and thus invited a food scandal.  19 January 2013 (NATO stops handing prisoners to Karzai regime)  The Karzai regime tortures prisoners, so NATO has stopped handing over prisoners to his government.  What, however, will NATO do when it pulls out?  19 January 2013 (Luxury car sales up despite unemployment)  Although US unemployment has fallen just a little, luxury car sales are way up.  19 January 2013 (US-trained units of the Malian army)  The US trained units of the Malian army, which defected to the Islamist rebels.  19 January 2013 (Urgent: Tell Congress to listen to common sense)  US citizens: tell Congress to listen to common sense rather than to the NRA.  19 January 2013 (Urgent: Oppose genetically modified salmon)  US citizens: sign this petition against genetically modified salmon.  19 January 2013 (A bill for strong measures against global heating)  Senator Sanders will introduce a bill for strong measures against global heating.  19 January 2013 (Congressional office computers used for unauthorized downloads)  Congressional staff (or congresscritters) use office computers for unauthorized downloads.  When the congresscritters start doing this, we may get sensible copyright laws.  19 January 2013 (Bisphenol S)  After studies connecting bisphenol A with cancer, diabetes and other illnesses, industry began replacing it with bisphenol S. That might be dangerous too.  19 January 2013 (Urgent: Oppose fracking near national parks)  US citizens: sign this petition against allowing fracking near national parks.  19 January 2013 (Ralph Nader writes to CEO of Walmart)  Ralph Nader's open letter to the CEO of Walmart.  19 January 2013 (NRA/Obama proposal to put armed thugs in schools)  The ACLU criticizes the NRA/Obama proposal to put additional armed thugs in schools.  19 January 2013 (NRA's focus)  The NRA focuses on protecting the gun rights of accused criminals, accused terrorists, etc.  On one point, I probably agree with the NRA. Forfeiture in the absence of conviction is a prima facie injustice, so if the NRA opposed that even for twisted reasons, it was a good thing  19 January 2013 (US-made Internet surveillance equipment)  US-made Internet surveillance equipment has been sold to oppressive regimes.  If the NSA's equipment for copying all Internet traffic was made in the US, then it is another example.  19 January 2013 (Chinese thugs raid class on using the Internet)  A class teaching Chinese people to use the Internet for making complaints was raided by thugs, and the teacher and computers were taken away.  19 January 2013 (Evil greedy jerks push for cuts in Social Security)  A group of rich CEOs are pushing cuts in Social Security.  Naturally, their proposed solution to any problem is to hurt everyone who's not rich. Merely being rich does not imply someone is an evil greedy jerk, but these people are evil greedy jerks.  18 January 2013 (The prosecutor who drove Aaron Swartz to death)  The prosecutor who drove Aaron Swartz to death had earlier prosecuted a man for translating al Qa'ida statements.  In other words, she chose to spearhead a campaign against freedom of speech in the US.  18 January 2013 (UK activists sue undercover thugs)  Many UK women activists are suing because thug infiltrators formed long-term sexual relationships with them. Since 8 out of 9 known thug infiltrators did this, there appears to have been a general policy to encourage them to do so. The thugs dropped their lovers them without warning when their missions were over.  Can anyone tell which accusations are going to be heard in the special secret court?  18 January 2013 (Mass protest movement in Iraq)  A mass protest movement in Iraq is aimed at al-Maliki's corruption.  18 January 2013 (Syrian rebels vs Islamist rebels)  Some secularist Syrian rebels say they consider the Islamist rebels an enemy.  18 January 2013 (Protest march in Pakistan)  A protest march for eliminating corruption from Pakistan's elections did not achieve much.  18 January 2013 (Bradley Manning not allowed to present defense)  Bradley Manning will not be allowed to present a defense based on public interest or his motives.  The judge works for the military command, including Obama, and knows his career depends on making the decisions that he command structure wants. The deck is stacked against Manning.  18 January 2013 (Super PAC shell companies)  17% of the donations to Super PACs were routed through shell companies, and their real origin is unknown.  18 January 2013 (Benefit of treating farm animals humanely)  Treating farm animals humanely will also improve people's health and help protect the environment.  Many US restaurants offer large portions of fatty foods.  18 January 2013 (Urgent: Release of report on CIA torture)  US citizens: sign the ACLU's petition for the Senate Intelligence Committee to release its report on CIA torture.  18 January 2013 (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)  Rep. Lofgren proposes to modify the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act so it could not be used to prosecute people that violate web site or Internet gateway terms of service.  18 January 2013 (Bizarre laws passed by NRA)  The NRA, with help from ALEC, has passed bizarre laws banning some states from destroying guns obtained by "buy-back" programs.  18 January 2013 (Food shortage in Guatemala)  In Guatemala, diversion of land to making biofuel for the US is causing a food shortage.  Population growth would eventually lead to a similar food shortage &mdash; to prevent that, all possible must be done to facilitate and encourage contraception and abortion &mdash; but that is no excuse for causing an artificial food shortage now.  18 January 2013 (Internet-age copyright enforcement)  Internet-age copyright enforcement directly harms writers and artists who are not stars.  The article is partly based on assumptions that I disagree with. For instance, it uses the adversary's propaganda term "piracy". I do not believe that our freedom to share published works can legitimately be limited even if non-star artists did stand to gain. Nonetheless, its point is interesting.  18 January 2013 (Football player's brain injury)  A famous American football player who committed suicide suffered from brain damage probably caused by shock to the head while playing football.  He's not the only one: thousands of former players are suing the league. I don't know whether the league did anything dishonest, but it is clear that rules must be changed to protect players in the future.  18 January 2013 (CIA torture films)  The CIA torture films that won't be made.  18 January 2013 (Another Kuwaiti sent to prison for insulting ruler)  Another Kuwaiti was given two years in prison for criticizing the ruler.  Some of his tweets are very hostile, and I understand why the emir feels insulted. However, insults must not be a crime.  Kuwait is not the only country that criminalizes insults. I wonder if these tweets would be a crime in the UK too.  18 January 2013 (US judge refuses to look at secret evidence)  A US judge refused to look at secret evidence that the US government wanted to show him and take away.  He's hearing the case of a woman who is suing to get off the secret no-fly list.  18 January 2013 (Church of Scientology)  The central Church of Scientology is pushing harder to raise funds from its local branches, and this is creating resentment among long-term participants.  There is so much irony here &mdash; for instance, in the idea of criticizing that church for "changing the original teachings of L. Ron Hubbard", as if those teachings were anything but an experiment in exploiting gullibility.  Many churches violate IRS rules for tax-exempt organizations. Why shouldn't they have to be audited and report their dealings just as the FSF is required to do?  18 January 2013 (Punishment for pissing on a corpse)  A US soldier will be punished for the crime of pissing on the corpse of a Taliban fighter.  It makes practical sense to order soldiers not to do that, and punish those who disobey. But it is perverse to punish this and leave torturers scot-free.  18 January 2013 (Kucinich joins Fox News)  Kucinich will become a commentator on Fox News.  This has the potential to do a lot of good, but could also backfire. So I won't fault him for trying.  18 January 2013 (Obama pushing for real gun control)  Obama has decided to push for real gun control. Most of this plan is good, and it is vital to propose more than the opposition will eagerly accept.  One bad element is the plan to put more thugs in schools, supposedly to curb gun violence.  This loony NRA idea would do more harm than good. Shootings in schools are rare, but thugs put students in a lot of danger.  18 January 2013 (African Islamists kill civilians intentionally)  African Islamists kill civilians intentionally for revenge. Even though Obama's assassination policy is not as bad as this, we must not make al Qa'ida our standard of comparison for judging the US.  18 January 2013 (Facebook's new search interface)  Facebook's new search interface enables users to poke at other users' data in new ways. The ethical import is that it shows how Facebook itself, and the US government (which can get Facebook's entire collection of personal data without a court order), have always been able to poke around in it.  18 January 2013 (GPS tracking)  The US "Justice" Department is keeping its legal opinions on GPS tracking secret.  18 January 2013 (Imprisonment of John Kiriakou)  The imprisonment of John Kiriakou, torture whistleblower, is focusing opposition to Obama's protection of torturers.  Kiriakou and Swartz were both prosecuted based on laws used as excuses to get someone.  18 January 2013 (Obama's refusal to show assassination guidelines)  Obama has refused for years to show Senator Wyden the secret US assassination guidelines, which Obama claims are meant to constitute "due process of law".  18 January 2013 (Coca Cola's justification for false claims)  Coca Cola says that its false health claims for sugar water with vitamins are not illegal because no reasonable person would ever believe them.  In other words, Coca Cola says, "Don't believe anything we say."  You should not buy any Coca Cola Company products, even water without sugar and vitamins, as part of the boycott in response to the killing of union organizers in Colombia and Guatemala.  18 January 2013 (Gov't borrowing can be a good thing)  The IMF helps bury awareness that government borrowing can be a good thing.  18 January 2013 (Urgent: Reform the CFAA)  US citizens: sign this petition to reform the CFAA, which makes it easy to prosecute people for violating arbitrary "terms of service".  18 January 2013 (Price of quinoa)  The popularity of quinoa in the US and Europe has made it so expensive that poor people in Peru can no longer afford it.  This is a common kind of problem: when the wealthier countries twitch, they can bounce poor people in other countries onto the floor. The only solution is for them to establish governments that will make sure that their economic growth benefits everyone.  17 January 2013 (Ban single women)   Iran plans to ban single women from travelling without their male guardian's permission.  17 January 2013 (Free Scientific Publishing)   Free Scientific Publishing  17 January 2013 (Secret Service was involved in investigating Aaron Swartz)  Why did the Secret Service get involved in investigating Aaron Swartz?  17 January 2013 (Ignoring rational objections to GMO foods)  Mark Lynas used to make irrational fear arguments against GMO foods. Now he recognizes his own objections were irrational, so he supports GMOs and ignores the rational objections.  17 January 2013 (Persecution of Aaron Swartz)  The persecution of Aaron Swartz was an instance of a general US pattern of twisting the law to punish dissidents while giant acts of corruption and tyranny go ignored.  17 January 2013 (Honoring Aaron Swartz)  Liberating articles from JSTOR in honor of Aaron Swartz.  17 January 2013 (The Cold War years)  Eight Things I Miss About the Cold War.  17 January 2013 (Israeli school principal supports left-wing parties)  An Israeli high school principal may lose his job because he published an article supporting left-wing parties that sometimes advocate peace.  17 January 2013 (Dubya's "surge" in Iraq)  Refuting the myth that Dubya's "surge" in Iraq was a success.  The real success was recruiting Iraqi Sunnis that didn't want a civil war.  17 January 2013 (Senator Wyden demands to see assassination rules)  Senator Wyden demands that Brennan show senators the assassination rules that Brennen drew up for Obama.  That is a step forward, but I think they ought to publish the rules by which they decide who to kill.  17 January 2013 (Gov. O'Malley seeks to abolish death penalty)  Governor O'Malley of Maryland will try to abolish the death penalty.  17 January 2013 (East Coast vulnerable to flooding)  Destruction of dunes by Hurricane Sandy has left much of the East Coast vulnerable to flooding from ordinary storms.  17 January 2013 (Soot emissions from engines)  Reducing soot emissions from engines could buy time against global heating.  17 January 2013 (Interviews with Malian refugees)  Interviews with Malian refugees who fled from the Islamists' Shari'a law.  Musicians also welcome French intervention.  The Touareg revolt in Mali was fueled by former Gaddafi soldiers who fled Libya. There are some who claim this proves that Western intervention in Libya was harmful or wrong. I don't think so. Every action in life has many consequences, and in every case some of them are bad. Libyans are mostly glad that Gaddafi is gone.  Besides which, the Toureg revolt did not create the Islamists. Rather, they took advantage of the resulting power vacuum.  This information has the potential to be an overall success as long as most Malians view it as helping them throw off oppression. If they come to think of it as killing them for no reason, then they will resent it and eventually kick it out.  17 January 2013 (Israeli soldiers kill student)  Israeli soldiers shot and killed student Samir Awad as he was running away from them.  17 January 2013 (Pakistan's prime minister arrested)  Pakistan's prime minister has been arrested on corruption charges.  16 January 2013 (Oppressing women to "protect" them)  Indian reactionaries cite rape as the reason to "protect women" by oppressing them with restrictions &mdash; in effect, an outgrowth of blaming the victim.  This irrational reversal is not limited to India. Some European countries "protect" prostitutes by arresting their customers, and most of the US "protects" prostitutes by arresting them. All of which is designed to make these women do something they dislike more than prostitution.  16 January 2013 (Hollande recognizes urgency of cutting CO2)  French President Hollande recognized the desperate urgency of cutting CO2 emissions.  16 January 2013 (The intervention in Mali)  Explaining the intervention in Mali, and why Malians support it, and how it could go wrong.  16 January 2013 (Cubans allowed to travel freely abroad)  Cuba has allowed Cubans to travel freely abroad.  16 January 2013 (Argument against EU regulations on Arctic oil drilling)  The UK government is trying to eviscerate EU regulations on Arctic oil drilling on the grounds that oil spills "may be effectively dispersed" on their own.  I am sure that happens occasionally, especially for small spills, but in order for this to be a valid reason, it would have to occur always and reliably. To be persuaded by this argument, someone would have to overlook that flaw.  Who could overlook such an obvious flaw? Either an idiot, or someone who has a reason to act like an idiot. I don't think idiots do these negotiations.  16 January 2013 (PDF protest in honor of Aaron Swartz)  The PDF protest in honor of Aaron Swartz involves posting paywalled journal articles on Twitter.  16 January 2013 (Fukushima cleanup workers untrained)  The contractors working to clean up fallout from areas near Fukushima have not been taught what to do.  As a result they often either move the fallout around or expose themselves to it.  16 January 2013 (Neoliberal economic faith)  The neoliberal economic faith has led to disaster, but is still invoked to justify rewarding those responsible for the disaster.  16 January 2013 (Urgent: Gun control)  US citizens: call on the Senate to pass gun control to limit massacres.  16 January 2013 (Pro-abortion-rights)  Planned Parenthood will no longer describe itself as "pro-choice".  I think it was a short-sighted mistake to advocate "choice" rather than "abortion rights". In the long term, that position is timid, and that grants undeserved validity to the opposition.  I am not pro-choice, I am pro-abortion-rights. But even beyond that, I am in favor of abortion. An unintended pregnancy is regrettable; an abortion is not.  16 January 2013 (Urgent: Stop global heating)  US citizens: call on the US government to take action to stop global heating.  16 January 2013 (Why photos of dead bin Laden remain secret)  A former CIA agent asks why the CIA cooperated with Zero Dark Thirty while keeping the real photos of dead Osama bin Laden secret.  I think I can answer her question. This movie depicts and justifies US government crimes, but since it is fiction, passing as journalism only when that suits it, it is not proof of anything. The photos of bin Laden might be evidence of some US government crimes.  16 January 2013 (Surprise attack by Islamists in Mali)  Islamist fanatics in Mali launched another front with a surprise attack closer to the capital.  16 January 2013 (UK to decriminalize vague general insults)  The UK will take a small step towards freedom of speech, decriminalizing vague general insults but not specifically targeted ones.  16 January 2013 (Burgers, asthma and skin problems)  Frequent eating of burgers correlates with asthma and skin problems in teenagers.  Fast food was made for fasting, not for eating.  16 January 2013 (Sexism in hiring scientists)  A simple experiment proves the presence of sexism in hiring scientists.  16 January 2013 (Burmese protesters face charges )  Burma's government talks of democracy, but protesters face charges.  16 January 2013 (Proposals to preserve entitlements for the rich)  Right-wing proposals seek to cut the entitlements that non-rich Americans depend on, while preserving the entitlements for the rich.  When it is time to cut the deficit, we should cut the entitlements for the rich. But it's a mistake to cut the deficit now. We need deficit spending to get out of the recession.  16 January 2013 (Threat faced by Aaron Swartz)  Aaron Swartz was threatened with more prison time than killers, slave dealers, and bank robbers. Even helping al Qa'ida develop nuclear weapons carries a lower penalty.  I think this reflects the high priority given by the US to the War on Sharing.  16 January 2013 (Denying workers sick days spreads flu)  US corporations spread influenza (and other diseases) by denying workers paid sick days.  16 January 2013 (Dangerous level of soot in Beijing air)  Soot in Beijing air has reached an acutely dangerous level, provoking open criticism of weak government enforcement of pollution regulations.  The soot is produced by burning fuel, which also emits CO2. A massive conversion effort to renewable energy is needed, both for the short term and for the long term.  16 January 2013 (Schools destroyed by Taliban in Pakistan)  The Taliban in Pakistan have destroyed many schools, so that 60,000 children can no longer get an education. The Pakistan army also takes away their schools for uses as bases.  16 January 2013 (Islamic extremists in Pakistan massacre 100)  Islamic extremists in Pakistan massacred 100 members of a Shi'ite minority group.  16 January 2013 (Opposition to torture)  As official America stands firm to protect torturers, opposition to torture is relegated to the Oscar vote.  Please do not watch Zero Dark Thirty in a way that would give Sony any money. To do so would be to reward it.  Please don't give Sony money for anything else, either.  15 January 2013 (Urgent: Fire Carmen Ortiz)  US citizens: sign the petition calling on Obama to fire prosecutor Carmen Ortiz, who was in charge of the exaggerated charges that drove Aaron Swartz to suicide.  15 January 2013 (Shannon McLeish listed as terrorist) Shannon McLeish was surprised to find herself  listed as a terrorist suspect, but since she is active in political opposition in the US, perhaps it is only normal.   15 January 2013 (Imaginary need for the US to make cuts)  There is no reason for the US to cut Social Security or Medicare, and lots of reasons not to cut them. The imaginary need for cuts was invented by right-wingers who want an excuse to transfer more wealth to the rich. The best way to cut US health care costs, while improving care, is to adopt a Canadian-style national health service.  15 January 2013 (Economy)  Why the Massive Wealth of the 1% Could Ruin the Economy.  15 January 2013 (CIA) John Brennan must commit to getting the CIA out of the killing  business before he is confirmed.   15 January 2013 (Hindu extremists) Naveen Soorinje faces absurd fabricated charges in India for photographing a mob of Hindu extremists  in the act of bullying women on the street. These Hindu extremists are just as bad as the Muslim extremists in Saudi Arabia and Iran.   15 January 2013 (Iran sanctions deprive thousands of medicine)  The Iran financial sanctions have left hundreds of thousands unable to get medicine for  serious illnesses.   When medicine is available, people often  don't have money for medicine and food. (That happens in the US too.) Meanwhile, the Iranian government has no incentive to make a deal about uranium enrichment because the US would not be able to remove the sanctions as part of the deal.   15 January 2013 (Global Heating)  How global heating will devastate agriculture: predicting the decreases in production of crops  such as maize, wheat and soy beans.   15 January 2013 (Censorship of Southern Weekly in China)  Defiance of censorship over the cause of Southern Weekly is spreading in China.  Here's more information about the editorial, the censorship of which sparked the movement.  15 January 2013 (Vietnamese dissident bloggers sentenced)  Vietnamese dissident bloggers have been sentenced to as much  as 13 years in prison.  15 January 2013 (Urgent: Legalize DDoS)  US citizens: sign this petition in favor of legalizing DDoS.  I am disappointed that the petition uses the term "hacking" apparently in reference to breaking security, but it is still good enough to sign.  Here's what I wrote about it.  15 January 2013 (US attorneys blamed for death of Aaron Swartz)  Family blames US attorneys for death of Aaron Swartz.  15 January 2013 (Proposed tidal power system in England)  A proposed tidal power system in a river in England is facing objections on behalf of fish that could be harmed.  I am skeptical that anyone can reliably create new habitats for a specific marine ecosystem, and also that these turbines will be safe for all the fish that try to go through them.  Nonetheless, if this tidal power scheme will replace a lot of CO2 emissions, it might harm marine life less than ocean acidification does. So that is the crucial question, it seems to me. Will the state make sure that this is instead of CO2 emission? Or will it be instead of some other, safer form of renewable generation?  15 January 2013 (Use of digital medical records)  The use of digital medical records was supposed to reduce US health care costs, but it has not done so.  In addition, this usually means dependence on proprietary software.  15 January 2013 (Microsoft pushing Messenger users to Skype)  Microsoft is pushing users to switch from its Messenger service, which can be used with free/libre software, to Skype, which requires a proprietary client.  Don't do it!  15 January 2013 (US to increase oil extraction)  As the damage done by global heating becomes manifest, the US is heading for increased oil extraction.  15 January 2013 (Polio eradicated in India)  India has vanquished polio; but as long as polio remains in the world, it can come back.  15 January 2013 (Afghan women fear return of Taliban)  Afghan women fear the return of the Taliban, but the current situation is not much better.  I supported the conquest of Afghanistan for the sake of Afghan women, since at the time it appeared possible to defeat the Taliban. However, it is futile to continue the war indefinitely with no prospect of winning it.  We might be able to do some good by giving Afghan women guns and instruction in accurate shooting. That has some chance of denying the Taliban real victory. When Afghan men can expect to be killed by the women of their families for oppressing women, things may start to improve.  15 January 2013 (Netanyahu arrests tent village protesters)  Netanyahu arrested the Palestinians in their tent village protest, defying an injunction from the Supreme Court.  Declaring the area a "closed military zone" is the standard all-purpose excuse for arbitrarily banning any Palestinian activity.  15 January 2013 (New trials for Mubarak and officials)  Mubarak and some officials of his suppression forces will have new trials.  15 January 2013 (The fight against Islamists in northern Mali)  France and other countries are joining in the fight against the Islamists that have taken control of northern Mali.  Even local Muslims feel oppressed by them, and they have destroyed irreplaceable cultural relics.  A revolt of the Touaregs started this fight. The Touareg rebels were not Islamist fanatics, but made common cause with them. They may have valid grievances, and catering to those could help defeat the Islamists.  15 January 2013 (Aaron Swartz was fighting for us all)  Why the US government was out to get Aaron Swartz: he was fighting for us all.  15 January 2013 (Urgent: Thank Obama for protecting workers)  US citizens: thank Obama for legislation and orders to protect workers of US contractors operating outside the US from enslavement.  15 January 2013 (Level of mercury in the oceans)  Human activity has doubled the level of toxic mercury in the upper levels of the oceans.  15 January 2013 (3 trillion dollars a year)  Various tax deductions, special lower rates, and absence of some desirable taxes, cost the US treasury 3 trillion dollars a year.  I am not sure absolutely all of these changes should be made. There may be valid reasons for some of the current policies.  However, the list does not include a carbon emissions tax, which would be a very good idea.  15 January 2013 (Lacking firmness to reject Obama's right-wing laws)  The Progressive Caucus in the US Congress lacks the firmness to reject Obama's right-wing laws.  15 January 2013 (Bolivia's adjustment to UN anti-drug treaty)  Bolivia succeeded in winning an adjustment to the UN anti-drug treaty, for its law allowing the traditional practice of chewing coca leaves.  This is a form of victory, but since that treaty demands so much injustice, I think that it would have been a bigger victory for Bolivia to reject the treaty permanently.  15 January 2013 (Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia in danger of execution)  Foreign workers in Saudi Arabian homes are in danger of execution after ludicrous trials.  15 January 2013 (Effects of global heating on US airports)  13 US airports have runways likely to be inundated due to global heating. And that's just the beginning of the damage.  15 January 2013 (Gun control for the Pentagon)  How About Gun Control for the Pentagon?  15 January 2013 (The Many Killers of Aaron Swartz)  The Many Killers of Aaron Swartz.  Weinstein is confident that DRM will crumble. I wish I could be so confident. I fear that services such as Spotify and Netflix, which distribute works over the net with DRM and never allow a person to own a copy, or gain access anonymously, together with malicious hardware such as HDCP, may erect a seamless DRM jail that nobody succeeds in breaking.  Thus, we need to fight them &mdash; and above all, refuse ever to use them. Please support DefectiveByDesign.org.  15 January 2013 (Promises of money for Haiti)  The world promises lots of money for Haiti, and spends a fair amount, but the money doesn't do what Haitians need.  The alternative of giving money to the Haitian government &mdash; so corrupt that the US imposed a president &mdash; is no panacea.  15 January 2013 (Text message servers)  US Surveillance Law May Poorly Protect New Text Message Services.  The text message servers that are good to use are those that don't record what messages people send.  15 January 2013 (US legal judgments liberated by Aaron Swartz)  Aaron Swartz succeeded in liberating a large fraction of US legal judgments through a hack.  This might be part of the reason that the prosecutor was determined to get him. It might also be part of the reason that he thought of trying to liberate journal articles in a similar way. However, the two hacks had differences also.  15 January 2013 (Brennan's record of defending torture)  Brennan is on record defending torture, but the New York Times creates a false appearance of doubt by calling that an "accusation".  15 January 2013 (Planned Parenthood)  To whip up hatred of Planned Parenthood amongst people who disapprove of abortion, a right-wing demagogue disregards most of its work so as to claim it is nearly all abortion.  If Planned Parenthood's work were mainly abortions, it would still be a good thing. Given the world's dangerous overpopulation, abortion is good because it avoids a birth.  15 January 2013 (Urgent: Confirm Hagel as Secretary of Defense)  US citizens: call on the Senate to confirm Hagel as Secretary of Defense.  15 January 2013 (Urgent: Protect blue whales)  US citizens: call on Obama to tell the Navy to allow San Francisco shipping to protect blue whales.  15 January 2013 (Urgent: Adequate gun regulation)  US citizens: tell your elected officials you support adequate gun regulation.  14 January 2013 (US gov't complicit in injustice of Guantanamo)  Every branch of the US government is complicit in the prima facie injustice of the Guantanamo prison.  14 January 2013 (New Hampshire to subsidize religious schools)  New Hampshire plans to subsidize religious schools with millions of dollars of tax money.  14 January 2013 (Obama reprising Dubya's TSA plan)  Obama is reprising Dubya's plan to make the TSA study a lot of data about air passengers.  14 January 2013 (Doctors' incomes and quality of care)  New York City Ties Doctors' Income to Quality of Care.  In addition to the possible problems described in the article, I wonder whether payments are the best way to lead doctors to try their best.  14 January 2013 (Aaron Swartz's death)  Aaron Swartz, founder of Demand Progress, killed himself.  Swartz faced the threat of years in prison for what must have been a scheme to liberate scholarly articles published behind a paywall.  I didn't know Swartz personally, so I have no knowledge about the extent to which he was depressed, independent of his legal situation. But apparently that alone wasn't enough to kill him.  Having a tendency for depression does not mean one is impervious to reality. The reality of the US attack against him surely contributed to how depressed he felt.  So we have reason to think the US government drove Swartz to it. This was not murder; the US did not aim to kill him, only to ruin his life on behalf of the copyright industry. But it probably did kill him.  14 January 2013 (Urgent: Stand firm against NRA pressure)  US citizens: urge Biden's gun violence commission to stand firm against NRA pressure.  14 January 2013 (Uri Avnery endorses Hagel)  Uri Avnery endorses Hagel for Secretary of Defense. He says this could be a sign that the Israeli hawks' lobby is just beginning to lose its grip over the US.  14 January 2013 (Urgent: Protect orcas)  US citizens: call on the National Marine Fisheries Service to maintain protection for the southern resident group of orcas.  14 January 2013 (Urgent: Protect caribou)  US citizens: call on Obama to protect caribou by canceling the Keystone XL pipeline.  Of course, there are more important reasons to cancel it, but we may as well support this campaign too.  14 January 2013 (French ISPs demands payment from Google)  Major French ISPs are limiting the capacity of communications with Google, demanding payment from Google for carrying its responses to users.  14 January 2013 (Airbase captured by Islamist Syrian militia)  An Islamist Syrian militia captured a major airbase.  14 January 2013 (Big banks served well by Geithner)  Geithner has served the big banks well during his four years as Secretary of the Treasury.  14 January 2013 (Honest medical recommendations and plots)  Pakistan demonstrates the endpoint of the practice of assuming medical recommendations are a plot.  Old medical recommendations such vaccination, and iodized salt, are not plots. Unfortunately, new medicines often are a plot &mdash; though not the sort those Pakistani fools believe in. Pharma companies plot to get medicines approved even if they are not really effective, or not really safe. We must do whatever it takes to end their ability to corrupt medicine.  Why hasn't that been done already? Because the pharma companies use their political power to stop it. Thus, this is an instance of the general political problem that affects many areas of life: the political power of business.  14 January 2013 (US "aid" to Haiti)  US "aid" to Haiti follows Hilary Clinton's idea of "economic statecraft": it is designed to benefit US business interests, not Haitians.  14 January 2013 (Draft treaty on mercury emissions weak)  The draft treaty on mercury emissions is so weak that it won't do its job. The US and EU helped weaken it.  14 January 2013 (Record heat in Australia)  Record heat and disastrous fires are making Australians realize that global heating is a real danger.  The US will also experience great heat-waves in the future. This report spells it out.  14 January 2013 (Amazon's new ripping service)  Amazon's new service, that offers you an MP3 for CDs you bought there, respects your rights less than ripping the CDs yourself. Don't use it.  14 January 2013 (General McChrystal on drones)  General McChrystal says that possession of drones leads the US into arrogant behavior that stimulates hatred.  14 January 2013 (Call for withdrawal from Afghanistan)  Rep. Barbara Lee calls for withdrawal from Afghanistan and reduction of military spending.  13 January 2013 (Urgent: End AIG's tax breaks)  US citizens: support Senator Warren's push to end AIG's tax breaks.  Here's how outrageous AIG has become.  13 January 2013 (Obama regime says it would prosecute whistleblowers)  The Obama regime says it would prosecute whistleblowers that leak information to a newspaper.  13 January 2013 (PEN Turkey faces charges of "insulting the state")  PEN Turkey faces charges of "insulting the state" for criticizing the repression of writers in Turkey.  13 January 2013 (Anti-corruption movement in Pakistan)  A large anti-corruption movement in Pakistan demands precautions to assure a free election.  13 January 2013 (Explanation about amok)  An explanation about amok &mdash; are some mass shootings in the US the same phenomenon?  13 January 2013 (Platinum coin)  Why the platinum coin would have to be made of platinum: a law authorizes special platinum coins of any face value.  A trillion-dollar copper coin or aluminum coin would work just as well, if the law authorized those.  13 January 2013 (Japanese gov't wants to keep using nuclear power)  The new Japanese government wants to keep using nuclear power.  13 January 2013 (Urgent: Make filibusters take real work)  US citizens: sign this petition asking the Senate to make filibusters take real work.  13 January 2013 (Farmers protest against Monsanto empire)  Farmers protested at the White House against the Monsanto GMO empire.  13 January 2013 (Prisoner, never charged with crime, dies in Guantanamo)  Adnan Farhan Abdul Latif died in Guantanamo prison after 11 years of imprisonment without being charged with any crime. He is said to have perhaps committed suicide taking a drug overdose, but the autopsy results are secret. Perhaps they conceal some sort of crime committed by the US.  The only obstacle to releasing some Tunisian prisoners from Guantanamo is the unjust law recently signed by Obama &mdash; the same one that permits him to imprison anyone without trial simply by accusing that person of working for al Qa'ida.  13 January 2013 (YouTube's approach to fair use)  YouTube's approach to fair use is, in effect, to let copyright holders decide what qualifies as fair use.  13 January 2013 (Urgent: Cancel Shell's permit to drill in the Arctic)  US citizens: tell Interior Secretary Salazar to cancel Shell's permit to drill for oil in the Arctic.  The grounding of the Kulluk shows that Shell will impose extra risk of severe environmental damage just to save a few million dollars. To put that attitude together with the risk of a major and irreparable disaster is asking for trouble.  13 January 2013 (Malalai Joya to US, NATO, Afghan leaders: Get out.)  Malalai Joya tells the US, NATO, and Afghan leaders: Get out.  The article calls this a "simple message", but it turns out not to be so simple. As seen in the full interview, she condemns both the Taliban and the warlords as power-hungry misogynists. I am sure they are misogynists, and if she says they are all power-hungry, I will take he word for that. She condemns Karzai as a sellout who has done little for women's rights.  Then she condemns US efforts to convince them to make peace between those factions. I can't follow her there. Afghanistan can have peace only if the fighting between those factions stops.  She hopes that democratic, modernist Afghans will instead defeat all those factions. That would be the ideal result. I don't see how it can happen, because those people seem to be too few, and not armed.  Here are the current actual US plans.  13 January 2013 (Guantanamo prisoners "cleared for release")  Over half the prisoners in Guantanamo are "cleared for release", but they may never be allowed to leave.  13 January 2013 (US domestic workers often below minimum wage)  US domestic workers are often paid less than the usual minimum wage, and may be cheated as well.  If the infirm non-rich would have trouble paying domestic care workers better, perhaps the state should tax the rich more and pay those workers directly.  13 January 2013 ("Redacted" report in secret UK court proceeding)  A "redacted" report in an unusual secret UK court proceeding demonstrates how such proceedings lend themselves to covering up torture.  13 January 2013 (UK plans to train Ethiopian thug unit)  The UK plans to train an Ethiopian thug unit noted for torture, rape and murder.  13 January 2013 (CIA's double standard on secrecy)  The CIA's double standard on secrecy.  13 January 2013 (Thugs invade house to seize painkillers)  Just after Barbara Mahaffey died, as her just-widowed husband was arranging for collection of her body, thugs invaded the house without a warrant to seize her painkillers.  This is part of the perversion called the War on Drugs. It seems to be having a bad trip.  13 January 2013 (Chilean judge calls for extradition of accused murderer)  A Chilean judge has called for the extradition of a man accused of murdering singer Victor Jara on behalf of General Pinochet, who launched the US-supported coup against President Allende on Sep 11, 1973.  13 January 2013 (Republican "death panel")  Republicans falsely accused Obama of planning "death panels" that would condemn sick people to death. Ten Republican governors are really doing it, by rejecting federal funds to extend Medicaid.  They know this kills poor people, but they are ready to sacrifice other people's lives to the principle that government should not help people.  12 January 2013 (Obama's education agenda)  Obama's education agenda turns education into a privatized commodity.  12 January 2013 (Sex education in the US)  Sex education in the US is often woefully incomplete, even inaccurate.  In addition, it almost never includes the important practical aspects: how to please your lover(s).  12 January 2013 (Journalist speaks about imprisonment in Guantanamo)  Interview with Sami al-Hajj, the al-Jazeera journalist who was a prisoner in Guantanamo.  Al-Hajj says that his captors knew very quickly they had arrested the wrong man, but they kept him in prison to hush up how they had tortured him &mdash; in Afghanistan and again in Guantanamo.  This is exactly the sort of thing that happens when torture is covered up. The cover-up continues: the Guantanamo kangaroo courts are designed to stop the defendants from telling the world about US government crimes. No matter what those people may have done wrong &mdash; and it's plausible some of them did &mdash; it can't excuse these US government crimes.  12 January 2013 ("Fiscal cliff" was misdirection)  The magician's con: Renewing FISA and the NDAA under cover of the Fiscal Cliff debates  12 January 2013 (Obama's authority to control debt ceiling and assault weapons)  Obama has ways to play hardball regarding the debt ceiling and assault weapons.  So if he makes a dreadful compromise with right-wingers instead, it will have been by choice.  12 January 2013 (The politics of national security)  National security is just as political as Social Security, but pretends not to be.  12 January 2013 (US mercenary companies pay small fine for torture)  US mercenary companies whose employees helped torture prisoners at Abu Ghraib got off with a small fine.  No one will go to jail for it.  12 January 2013 (Lead exposure and teenage pregnancy rates)  Exposure to lead may be the cause of the high teenage pregnancy rates that the US saw from the 60s through the 90s.  This suggests that Clinton's harsh "welfare reform", supposedly meant to dissuade poor unmarried American women from having babies and handing the bill to Aid to Families with Dependent Children, was unnecessary as well as unfair to the poor, since the supposed problem was solving itself.  Republicans cancelled funds to treat children with high lead levels. They'd rather let these children grow up to be criminals or single mothers, and provide an excuse for harsh right-wing "solutions".  Meanwhile, the world is not trying hard to stop mercury emissions, produced by the growing number of coal-burning power plants from causing the same sort of problem.  12 January 2013 (Accusations against Bradley Manning)  The US accusations against Bradley Manning would make anyone that gives information to reporters about military affairs guilty of "aiding the enemy".  In effect, they equate the public with "the enemy".  Bob Woodward's sources have nothing to fear, however, because this draconian policy will be selectively enforced.  12 January 2013 (Rebuilding Haiti)  Haitians can't move out of tents because rich families control the land near the capitol, and control the state too. Many of these homeless families are too poor to rebuild.  President Aristide could have done it.  11 January 2013 (Thugs accused of torture and rape)  Those accused of the Delhi rape-murder say they were tortured and raped by the thugs.  It is plausible to me. If they committed the crime, they should be punished for murder and rape (but not executed). However, rape and torture are not justified against anyone, not even rapists and murderers. The thugs ought to go on trial next.  11 January 2013 (Urgent: Violence Against Women Act)  US citizens: support the Violence Against Women Act.  11 January 2013 (Nokia phones give Nokia access to unencrypted HTTPS traffic)  Nokia phones redirect "secure" HTTPS traffic through their own proxies, which means they get access to the unencrypted data.  11 January 2013 (RFIDs in student cards)  The student who was suspended for refusing to wear a card with an RFID lost her case.  Her objection is based on superstition rather than ethics, but I am disappointed that other students have not objected. The schools must have turned them into sheeple. If all the students said "No RFID" and refused for just one day to wear them, the school would give up.  MIT ID cards have RFIDs, so I don't have one. The building that my office is in has doors with pox locks, controlled by those RFIDs, so I have to get in using various other methods.  11 January 2013 (Distortion of research on effects of fracking)  Fossil fuel companies have used various means to distort research on effects of fracking, including funding the research and private relationships with the scientists. As a result, we lack reliable independent study of the issue.  11 January 2013 (Obama's banksters)  Rumor says Obama will appoint another bankster as Secretary of the Treasury.  11 January 2013 (Twitter firm against censorship)  Twitter is resisting pressure from France to help prosecute people who made racist remarks.  I hope Twitter will remain firm against censorship. But means that opening an office in France is dangerous!  11 January 2013 (Obama's Partial Sellout)  Obama's Partial Sellout.  11 January 2013 (Voice telephone networks)  US telephone companies want to eliminate voice telephone networks and replace them with VOIP, and use this as an excuse to eliminate the regulations that protect phone subscribers' rights.  They say this is ok because Internet service is a competitive market, but that's not true.  Most Americans have very few options. There are so few important ISPs that Obama was able to arrange for all the important ones to join in a deal for unofficial punishment without trial.  11 January 2013 (Debt ceiling a real threat)  Unlike the imaginary "fiscal cliff", the debt ceiling is a real threat.  However, we can't let the Republicans use this to cut off old and sick Americans. The right thing is to do what Clinton did: let the Republicans shut down the government until they couldn't stand the consequences.  11 January 2013 (Representation of nature in economic terms)  "Economic" decisions cannot rationally treat nature as something to be exploited.  However, simple ideas for changing this, by calling natural systems "assets" and giving them monetary values, don't address the problem, because they tend to make it easy for companies to destroy any "natural asset" by paying the assigned "value".  A further danger arises if we give separate similar natural systems independent valuations. For instance, if we divide the world's wetlands in two equivalent halves, their "values" would be equal. That doesn't fit the facts.  The scarcer wetlands become, the more desperately we need those that remain. The damage from destroying one half (leaving the other half) might be a trillion dollars, and the damage from destroying the other half (leaving none) might be a hundred trillion. We can't model this by giving some value to each parcel of wetland independently. Is there any way to represent this in economic terms?  11 January 2013 (Chuck Hagel's critics)  Hagel's hawk critics harp on minor issues because they don't want to admit what they really oppose: a willingness to support peace.  11 January 2013 (Hottest year ever recorded in the US)  2012 was the hottest year ever recorded in the US &mdash; 1F hotter, on average, than the previous record year (1998), and 3F hotter than the average for the 20th century.  11 January 2013 (Venezuela's economy)  For over a decade, right-wing pundits have proclaimed that Venezuela is heading for economic disaster, but it's wishful thinking.  The real economic danger comes from the regimes that can't stand up to the banksters, as in the US and Europe.  11 January 2013 (Pacific bluefin tuna overfished)  The Pacific bluefin tuna is down to 1/20 of what it was a few decades ago, but instead of giving the species a chance to reproduce, people are desperately catching the immature ones.  If we were trying to eradicate them, this is what we would do.  11 January 2013 (Shells Arctic drilling plans)  The US will review Shell's Arctic drilling plans for safety.  11 January 2013 (Unilever to stop putting plastic beads in beauty products)  Unilever has agreed to stop putting tiny plastic beads in beauty products.  A decision by one company or even ten companies probably isn't enough; these ingredients need to be banned.  11 January 2013 (Driving While Black)  Stuart Lawrence accuses the UK thugs of stopping him 25 times on suspicion of Driving While Black.  This offence is well known from the US. Even Walking While Black is treated as a crime in places such as New York City.  11 January 2013 (Privatization of probation enforcement)  The UK conservatives want to privatize the work of supervising convicts on probation.  There are many state activities that cannot achieve 100% of their goals, due to the nature of the job. Preventing criminals on probation from committing crimes is such a job. Thus, politicians can always claim that the activity is being done badly, whether or not it really could be done much better.  Privatizing a government activity generally makes things worse, except when it gives citizens the benefit of direct competition. There is no room for such a benefit in privatizing probation enforcement, so it will make things worse, somehow.  The companies will get their profit by mistreating the employees, the probationers, or both. Then the executives will say that the company is "more efficient", meaning that it costs less because the workers get less. And it will lobby to sentence more people to probation, which would be a good thing if it opposes the lobby for more imprisonment. However, if the two lobbies combine to demand more convictions by establishing new crimes, we will really be sunk.  11 January 2013 (Manning treated illegally in prison)  Bradley Manning's judge ruled that Manning was treated illegally in prison, but decided that that will hardly affect the trial's outcome.  I expected this. Obama is Judge Lind's commander and she knows that Obama hates whistleblowers more than anyone else. Manning will be sentenced to many decades of imprisonment, as Obama wishes.  Let's all celebrate Bradley Manning Day next December 17.  11 January 2013 (Brennan's denial of civilian deaths by drone strikes)  Three months before John Brennan insisted that US drone strikes did not kill civilians, the US government received a protest from Pakistan about killing a large group of civilians.  11 January 2013 (Sony patents scheme for putting RFIDs in disks)  Sony may plan to put RFIDs in disks to implement a scheme that allows each disk to be read by only one computer.  Getting a patent on this nasty scheme is not the same as implementing it, so it is not clear that Sony actually plans to do this. But Sony has done other nasty things before.  11 January 2013 (Samer Issawi on hunger strike)  Samer Issawi, resident of Jerusalem, was imprisoned for "leaving Jerusalem" after he was found in a locality that Israel calls part of Jerusalem.  Israel may never have to confront the self-contradiction, since the court can consider secret evidence, and in any case there is no rush to hold a hearing.  Issawi has now been on hunger strike for 160 days.  11 January 2013 (CIA reduces drone attacks in Pakistan)  The CIA, apparently responding to public pressure, has reduced its drone attacks in Pakistan, and been more careful about targeting.  This doesn't eliminate the problems of drone attacks in Pakistan, but does make them less.  I don't see anything particularly wrong with drone bombers as weapons of war, when and where a war is openly being fought. They are less indiscriminate that artillery, and no worse than manned attack planes. However, drone attacks in Pakistan, where the US is not fighting a war, has the same problems as sending kill squads into Pakistan.  Oh wait, the US did that too.  11 January 2013 (Urgent: Protest against Guantanamo prison Jan 11)  In the US: Protest Jan 11 against the Guantanamo prison and imprisonment without trial.  10 January 2013 (Urgent: Comment on Fracking Plan for New York)  US citizens: submit a public comment about Governor Cuomo's fracking plan for New York State.  10 January 2013 (Imprisonment in the US for peaceful protest)  Brian Terrell faces 6 months imprisonment in the US for a peaceful protest.  This punishment is not at the level of Cambodia and Bahrain, but it's heading that way.  10 January 2013 (Urgent: Paul Krugman for Secretary of Treasury)  US citizens:  call on Obama to nominate Paul Krugman for the Secretary of the Treasury.  10 January 2013 (Urgent: Climate Cliff)  US citizens:  tell Obama to pull us back from the Climate Cliff.  10 January 2013 (Urgent: Disclosure of political spending by public companies)  US citizens: call on the SEC to require publicly traded companies to publicly disclose  their political spending.  10 January 2013 (Urgent: Constitutional amendment against treating corporations as humans)  US citizens:  sign this petition to Obama to support a constitutional amendment declaring that corporations are not entitled to human rights.  10 January 2013 (Urgent: Divestment of Mass. colleges from fossil fuels)  US citizens: call on Massachusetts colleges  to divest from fossil fuels.  09 January 2013 (Makers of propaganda film respond to criticism)  The makers of Zero Dark Thirty responded to the criticism that they legitimized torture by attacking a straw man and evading the real issue.  It's true, in general, that depicting torture is not necessarily endorsing it. The wrong of that film is in the way it depicts torture, as an effective and legitimate method, and in the way it aims for the effect of journalism while justifying falsehoods as fiction.  9 January 2013 (Urgent: Drones) US citizens:  call on the Senate to question Brennan about drones.  9 January 2013 (Automation)  As automation takes away the jobs of more and more Americans,  blind optimists assume most of them will find new, better jobs. What is really happening is that wages are going down and unemployment is going up.  Here's why. We need to subordinate efficiency and technical progress to the goal of ending poverty.  9 January 2013 (Disneyland)  Disneyland will now teach Americans' children  to enjoy the convenience of surveillance.  9 January 2013 (Banksters)  The US bank bailout was based on lies, and its result was to strengthen the banksters' grip  on the US government.  9 January 2013 (Alcohol)  A study found that alcohol affects development of teenagers' brains  more than marijuana. I don't think this affects the debate about marijuana &mdash; there are plenty of other reasons to legalize marijuana for adults. Rather, if it is confirmed that alcohol use by teenagers causes lasting harm (visible effect is not necessarily harm), it would be a reason to make more efforts to convince teenagers to avoid alcohol intoxication.   9 January 2013 (NY thugs ordered to stop frisking people without cause)  A US judge ordered the New York Thug Department to stop its practice of searching passersby with no specific cause in  certain parts of New York.   9 January 2013 (Economic Forum) The Davos economic forum (an organization of the rich) reports that it considers  global heating very dangerous. However, the rich who attend that forum don't seem to be using their influence to get governments to correct the problem.   9 January 2013 (Fundraising Campaign) Gabrielle Giffords is leading a fundraising campaign  to counter the NRA.  9 January 2013 (War) What does it mean to compare the  Iraq war to Vietnam?  09 January 2013 (Africa's decimated lion population)  Over 90% of Africa's lion population has been wiped out in the past 30 years, and they are now extinct or almost extinct in many countries.  09 January 2013 (Madness of charging for all positive externalities)  Cory Doctorow on the madness of trying to charge for all positive externalities.  The word "monitize" reflects that attitude, which is why I find it disgusting and refuse to use it.  I would go a little further than the article. Positive externalities make life good, so a good society will make sure they are copious. I suggest that we seek to support any given activity with the minimum possible interference with its possible positive externalities.  I think Doctorow made a mistake in using of the term "digital RIGHTS management", which is propaganda in favor of that noisome practice. By calling it "digital RESTRICTIONS management", we can adopt the viewpoint of the victims rather than that of the perpetrators.  09 January 2013 (Insults made hurtful by religious prudery)  Cruel teenage girls publicly insult other teenage girls by accusing them of having sex.  The victims may need someone to defend them publicly against the insults, but who can do this in a way that they will take to heart?  Religious prudery creates the ground for this form of insult to hurt. Once at a party I heard a conversation between two women in which one condemned a somewhat famous person for making no attempt to follow fashions. It was only later that I realized I should have said, right then, "Did you just condemn a woman for not letting the fashion industry manipulate her? You are making yourself an instrument of their oppression!" It's a different issue but I think the same recommendation implies.  The mirror image of the scorn for sexually unreserved women is the scorn for men who are not sexually aggressive.  09 January 2013 (Publication of nude photos)  A UK man with an exhibitionist name got an injunction against publishing photos of him "semi-nude".  I don't object strenuously to this law, but I can't particularly sympathize with him either. Society will be better off if we all get used to having nude photos published, and those who have chosen exhibitionist names should lead the way.  09 January 2013 (Forest fires and record temperatures in Australia)  Forest fires have burnt hundreds of square miles in Australia.  They are fueled by record high temperatures.  Now imagine it is 40 years from now and the temperature is 2C higher.  09 January 2013 (NRA's connection with armed security company)  The leader of the NRA's campaign for schools to have armed guards is connected with a company that wants to provide them.  09 January 2013 (The John Birch Society in Congress)  Around 60% of Congressional Republicans stand for the ideas of the John Birch Society, though some try to disguise this in running for office.  I would not say, however, that these two disputing parts of the Republican Party are two parties. They still cooperate for some purposes. It would be better if they did openly split, which is why they don't.  09 January 2013 (Iceland's name commission)  The complex issues of using the name "Bl&aelig;r" in Iceland.  In Spanish, some well-known names for females are masculine nouns: "Consuelo", for instance, is masculine and singular. Stranger still, "Dolores" is masculine and plural (though it seems cruel to name someone "pains" &mdash; perhaps Iceland's name commission would ban that one). It would be very surprising for a man to have one of these names; but many men do have "Mar&iacute;a" as a name (not the first name, though). Iceland could adopt the practice of declining the name "Bl&aelig;r" as masculine notwithstanding the person's gender.  09 January 2013 (Urgent: Block the Pebble Bay mine)  US citizens: call on Obama to let the EPA block the Pebble Bay mine, which the EPA has recognized would cause tremendous ecological damage.  09 January 2013 (Facebook turns data over to prosecutors)  Facebook data is easily available to prosecutors, but defense attorneys have trouble getting it.  09 January 2013 (Indian labor)  Women in India who make our clothing are paid under a dollar for a 12-hour work day.  I suspect it is no accident that the global brands' production uses unpoliceable subcontractors so much &mdash; I think that part of the reason for the practice is that these subcontractors can screw their workers without accountability. (I've read reports that in some countries they often shut down and leave workers unpaid, etc.)  Therefore, I suggest laws or campaigns against use of subcontracting in production.  09 January 2013 (China's labor camps)  China says it will "stop using" the infamous labor camps, but it is not clear what that implies in practice.  Dissidents have often been put in these labor camps without charges or trials, as in US Guantanamo prison. However, these may not be the only such prisons in China. The Panchen Lama and his family disappeared and have not been heard from since; I doubt they are in a labor camp where other prisoners could see them.  China is apparently replacing the labor camps with a new system of secret prisons for dissidents.  09 January 2013 ("Free trade" with China cuts US manufacturing jobs)  "Free trade" with China, the fault of President Clinton, cut US manufacturing jobs by almost 30%.  It may also be responsible for the tremendous inequality in China.  "Free trade" tends to increase total income, but that's not necessarily desirable. The US has plenty of total income; what it needs is to distribute that income better. And even China needs fairer distribution along with increased total income.  09 January 2013 (Republican opposition to helping Hurricane Sandy victims)  Over half the Republicans that voted against aid for those harmed by Hurricane Sandy had voted for aid for their own states.  09 January 2013 (Protest against nomination of John Brennan)  A protest against nomination of John Brennan for head of the CIA.  Another writer won't bother to protest Brennan this time, regarding Brennan's nomination as "symptom" of the fact that Obama is Bush in Democratic guise.  Brennan is a persistent liar: he repeatedly claimed that drone bombings did not kill civilians.  Just as a certain Republican candidate believed a raped woman's body has a way to neutralize sperm, Brennan apparently believes that a civilian's body has a way to neutralize shrapnel.  09 January 2013 (Occupy protests investigated by FBI "counterterrorism" agents)  FBI "counterterrorism" agents investigated the Occupy protests.  The FBI says that they did not do this investigation "based solely on First Amendment activity". Instead they follow a two-step process: where there is substantial "First Amendment activity", there is a possibility of terrorism, so they investigate. The practical result is the same, however, and protesters' brewing equipment can later be presented as bomb equipment.  09 January 2013 (Treating a corporation as a person)  If you believe that a corporation is a person, will you believe that having it in your car allows you to drive in the carpool lane?  I think courts will take the escape route of saying that the corporation is not physically located in a car just because its charter is in the car. Nonetheless, this case helps ridicule the Corporations United decision (to call it what it really is).  09 January 2013 (US banks to pay small fines for foreclosure "abuses")  Big US banks agreed to fairly small fines for foreclosure "abuses", but the victimized former homeowners won't get any of it.  Obama is generally on the side of the banksters.  09 January 2013 (Blogger sentenced to prison for "insult")  Kuwaiti blogger Rashid Saleh al-Anzi has been sentenced to two years in prison for "insulting" the ruler.  Even supposedly "free" countries such as England, France and Italy make mere insults a crime.  8 January 2013 (Urgent Note: Call On H&M)  US citizens: call on H&M to stop buying cotton from Daewoo, which gets it from  slave laborers in Uzbekistan.  8 January 2013 (Urgent Note: US Citizens) US citizens: protest the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline  on Feb 17.  8 January 2013 (The ACLU) The ACLU explains the danger of broad subpoenas  to Twitter about protesters.  8 January 2013 (Education) Making things in school is an  important part of education, f the school can surmount the obstacle of focusing mainly on standardized tests.  8 January 2013 (Medical Marijuana)  An Israeli research farm is making great advances in applying medical marijuana.  8 January 2013 (Homeopathy)  US parents are now invited to give their children sugar or water instead of medicine.  It's called "homeopathy".  8 January 2013 (Public Domain)  Here are some famous books, songs and films that would be entering the public domain now in the US, if recent laws had not attacked our rights.  8 January 2013 (Silicon Valley)  Big Silicon Valley companies have built on land that is below sea level and protected by levees  that rising seas are likely to lap over. Much as I would be glad to see Facebook flooded out of existence, this would hardly compensate for the millions that will be rendered homeless by the same sea level rise. It may be narrowly rational for these companies to ignore the issue, since the effects of global heating in 50 years may be so powerful that humans no longer have a civilization capable of making digital technology. But if they were wise, they would campaign for the measures needed to avoid that disaster.   8 January 2013 (Environmentalists)  Environmentalists plan to confront Obama over and over to  stop the Keystone XL planet-roaster pipeline.  The sad thing is that while building and using the pipeline would make disaster certain, cancelling the pipeline is not nearly enough to avoid the disaster.  8 January 2013 (High Crime Rate)  A mound of evidence shows that the high crime rate of the 60s-90s, around the world, was caused by the effects of lead on children's  developing brains.  Thus, the US could prevent future violent crime far more effectively, and at less cost, by removing what remains of the lead, than by running such big prisons. Of course, the prison-industrial complex and the War on Drugs are responsible for keeping so many Americans in prison. The US will have to defeat them to adopt an intelligent policy on the issue. And why does the UK still allow tetraethyl lead to be manufactured and exported to stunt minds and  cause crime in other countries?  8 January 2013 (China: Protests)  Protests against newspaper censorship in China are spreading  across the country.  8 January 2013 (Motorcycles) Aceh plans to prohibit women from riding motorcycles  the usual way. The idea of requiring women to conceal their appearance is closely linked to the idea that rape is ok women if the victim did not conceal her appearance.  8 January 2013 (Bahraini) Bahraini protest organizers have been sentenced to  life in prison.  8 January 2013 (John Brennan)  Obama is trying again to appoint torture advocate John Brennan as  director of the CIA.  The first time, opposition to torture convinced Obama to drop Brennan. Since then, Brennan has helped develop the US assassination policy; perhaps Obama considers that further proof of his suitability to run the CIA &mdash; or perhaps Smersh.   8 January 2013 (Censorship In China) A protest in China against censorship  of a newspaper.  8 January 2013 (The Euro Zone)  The euro zone has boosted Germany companies' exports, but this involves billions in automatic loans to the banks of other euro zone countries, with the paradoxical result that  poverty in Germany is growing along with exports. Another cause of this problem is the way exports are being boosted: through German government policies that keep wages down.   8 January 2013 (UK )  A Muslim in the UK beat her son to death because  he failed to memorize the Qur'an.   8 January 2013 (Bureau of Labor Statistics)  According to the on Bureau of Labor Statistics the US has 1.5 million heavy truck drivers, 176 thousand city and intercity bus drivers, 477 thousand school bus (and similar activities) drivers, and 166 thousand taxi drivers. An additional 770 thousand work as delivery drivers. In cases where the customers can go to the delivery truck to pick up the deliveries, these might be automated too. And there are half a million drivers that work in factories, warehouses, etc. Many of these jobs might be replaced too. Self-drive vehicles therefore threaten to put between 2 million and 3.5 million Americans out of work &mdash; and today's economy will not generate other decent jobs for them. To avoid an economic disaster, we must either limit the adoption of self-drive vehicles, or change our economy to give people a decent life even if they don't have work.   8 January 2013 (Marijuana)  Obama is aggressively prosecuting state-legalized medical marijuana  growers and users.  8 January 2013 (E-Cigarettes)  Is there any legitimate reason to ban e-cigarettes and push people to  stay with real tobacco?  E-cigarettes could cause health problems, especially if they lead people to  become nicotine addicts, and they then start using tobacco.  Perhaps selling e-cigarettes like tobacco, and keeping it away from teenagers, will be enough to keep this problem to a low level. In any case I don't see why airplanes should object to them.  8 January 2013 (Kuwaiti Dissidents) 200 Kuwaiti dissidents face  criminal charges for opposition.  8 January 2013 (China) China's Facebook-like Internet rules have chilled  Internet use there.  8 January 2013 (John Kiriakou)  John Kiriakou will go to prison for having an ordinary conversation  that officials have with reporters.  No excuse is too small for Obama's War on Whistleblowers and Journalists.  8 January 2013 (Russian National Police)  A member of the Russian national police, accused of participating in the scam that led to imprisoning and killing Magnitsky, is suing for libel under the  UK's perverse libel laws.  08 January 2013 (Obama to nominate Hagel)  Obama will nominate Hagel for Secretary of Defense, defying the Israeli hawks' lobby.  08 January 2013 (UK prosecutes torturer)  The UK is prosecuting a Nepalese officer for committing torture during that country's civil war.  This is the right thing to do, and it should be applied to the torturers of other countries, including the US and the UK.  08 January 2013 (Slow and unsteady approach to CO2 emissions)  Obama's slow and unsteady approach to CO2 emissions is typical of movements for social change. Unfortunately, physics won't let us have the time this will take.  08 January 2013 (Attitudes that make frequent rape persist)  What About The Sex Crimes Against Untouchable Women?  The article shows clearly the attitudes that make frequent rape persist: the unjust condemnation of victims (and even their relatives), and the patriarchal attitude towards women's sexuality.  08 January 2013 (US natural gas well leak)  One US natural gas well is leaking so much methane that it is worse for the climate than coal.  08 January 2013 (The partial budget deal)  Krugman comments on the partial budget deal.  One point he does not mention is that the deal raises the payroll taxes on working Americans, which is a regressive tax that gets progressively less on the rich.  08 January 2013 (Mine verges on being independent nondemocratic state)  A mine that straddles the Argentina-Chile border has been given such great concessions that it verges on being an independent nondemocratic state.  08 January 2013 (NY Times' reports on cluster bombs)  For the New York Times, cluster bombs that kill civilians are a lot worse when used by Assad than when used by Obama.  08 January 2013 (Mainstream media links guns to Occupy Wall Street)  Mainstream media concocted an apparently imaginary link from some guns found in New York to Occupy Wall Street.  08 January 2013 (Locksmiths refuse to work on foreclosures)  The locksmiths in one city in Spain have agreed to refuse to work on foreclosures. This adds to other forms of resistance.  Violence against someone who is killing you is legitimate. When people are at the point of killing themselves, because they are going to be out on the street and broke and in debt, in effect the banksters are killing them. There is no ethical reason they should go down without fighting back.  08 January 2013 (Patient dies at ill-equipped, privatized NHS office)  A privatized NHS office let a patient die because there was "no ventilator available".  Why was none available? I suspect the company did tried to get by with fewer of them in order to reduce costs and increase profits.  08 January 2013 (Urgent: Jobs not Wars)  US citizens: sign the Jobs not Wars petition.  08 January 2013 (Brominated vegetable oil in soda)  There is some evidence that brominated vegetable oil in soda can make people sick.  It is not certain, but do you want to risk it?  08 January 2013 (Islamists murdering teachers and health workers)  Islamists in Pakistan are now murdering teachers and health workers.  08 January 2013 (Patent trolls threaten end users with lawsuits)  An alphabet soup of patent trolls is threatening end users with lawsuits.  08 January 2013 (Paul Krugman as secretary of treasury)  Suggestion: Obama should appoint Paul Krugman as secretary of the treasury.  08 January 2013 (Greenwald endorses Hagel to run Pentagon)  Glenn Greenwald endorses Chuck Hagel to run the Pentagon.  I recently signed Jewish Voice for Peace's petition to Obama, which takes no position for or against Hagel, but which opposes the neocon opposition to him.  08 January 2013 (Gambling machines sucking money out of poor areas)  Gambling machines are sucking money out of some poor areas of England.  I don't believe in banning gambling, but regulations to make it less easily accessible, or reduce the amounts, could be a big help to people who don't have the self-control to limit what they bet.  08 January 2013 (Urgent: Discourage corporate support of ALEC)  US citizens: call on corporations to distance themselves from ALEC and its campaign to sell more guns.  08 January 2013 (US "War on Terror" designed to go on forever)  The US 'War on Terror' is designed to go on forever, and officials want it that way.  08 January 2013 (Peaceful protesters charged with felonies)  Protesters passively blocking the construction of the planet-roaster pipeline were charged with felonies.  Compare with Pussy Riot.  08 January 2013 (Safer driving with pot)  Legalizing pot may make for safer driving.  08 January 2013 (The public domain)  How the US Supreme Court has undermined the safety of the public domain.  We should try turning its position around, and argue that if Congress can take a work away from the public, it can also give a copyrighted work back to the public.  07 January 2013 (Letter to apologist for torture)  A letter to Kathryn Bigelow, apologist for torture.  07 January 2013 (LA thugs accused of forcing women to have sex)  LA thugs are being investigated for forcing women to have sex in order to avoid jail.  07 January 2013 (Wegelin pleads guilty to helping Americans evade taxes)  Swiss bank Wegelin pled guilty to helping Americans evade taxes, and will shut down.  07 January 2013 (US drones killing civilians in Yemen)  US drones, and maybe Saudi fighter planes, are killing civilians in Yemen, and all the governments involved are covering up what happened.  If Yemen is fighting a civil war against al Qa'ida, and requests military support, maybe it isn't wrong for the US or Saudi Arabia to provide that. But it is asking for trouble, since it is making Yemenis hate the US.  07 January 2013 (Urgent: Make filibusters take real work)  US citizens: sign this petition asking the Senate to make filibusters take real work.  07 January 2013 (Contest to replace "Happy Birthday to You")  A contest for a free song to replace the nastily copyrighted "Happy Birthday to You".  07 January 2013 (Giving a finger to a thug)  A US appeals court ruled that giving a finger to a thug is not grounds for arrest.  Europe should learn from this lesson.  07 January 2013 (Israeli soldiers shoot protesters)  Israeli soldiers shot Palestinians who protested a disguised arrest raid.  07 January 2013 (Food poisoning on a global scale)  Food poisoning on a global scale.  07 January 2013 (War on Drugs)  Obama's die-hard War on Drugs is targeting Mendocino County's medical marijuana patients.  07 January 2013 (No Child Left Behind)  How No Child Left Behind and the test-them-to-death mentality have made US schools rigid and crushing.  07 January 2013 (UK housing costs)  2/3 of the UK are struggling to pay housing costs.  This is the predictable result of policies that bow down to the banksters.  07 January 2013 (Malala Yousafzai)  Malala Yousafzai has been able to leave the hospital.  06 January 2013 (Rise in violent crime by thugs)  Violent crime in New York City continues to fall, but violent crime by the thugs is rising.  06 January 2013 (Europe's tendency to support the US too much)  European politicians' tendency to support the US too much is dangerous.  06 January 2013 (House Republicans extend War on Women)  Republicans in the House extended their War on Women by not renewing the programs that help women who are victims of domestic violence.  Both parties are more interested in helping robber barons on Wall Street, but the Democrats would like to help women also, whereas the Republicans would rather beat them down.  06 January 2013 (Midwest drought)  December's big snowfall did not relieve the drought in the Midwest. That would require eight such storms, roughly.  06 January 2013 (Urgent: Stop Murdoch)  US citizens: tell the FCC not to let Murdoch take control of more newspapers.  06 January 2013 (The Relativity of Wrong)  Isaac Asimov: The Relativity of Wrong.  06 January 2013 (Wall Street to fight for more poverty)  Wall Street is preparing for the battle to impose more poverty on America.  06 January 2013 (A plan to gerrymander presidential elections)  A new Republican plan to use their gerrymandered congressional election districts to gerrymander presidential elections too.  04 January 2013 (Linguistic Swifies)  New Linguistic Swifties for Wintu, Penutian, Cochiti, Taos, and Towa.  04 January 2013 (First Grav-Mass Card)  Possibly the first  Grav-mass card ever made.  04 January 2013 (Transocean agrees to slap on wrist)  Transocean, one of the companies responsible for the Big Spill, has agreed to pay a fine that amounts to a slap on the wrist.  US companies that trample the public habitually turn their fines into tax deductions.  04 January 2013 (G&eacute;rard Depardieu's rejection of tax plan)  Gerard Depardieu seems to be planning to accept Russian citizenship in order to renouce French citizenship.  To regard this as a defeat for Hollande is right-wing spin; in fact, it shows that Depardieu loves tyrants more than his country. Hollande should publicly tell Depardieu, "If you don't like democracy, move to Russia!"  The foofaraw about the unconstitutionality of the tax plan is interesting because Sarkozy also encountered such a rejection when he passed the French law (HADOPI) that inspired the UK's Digital Economy Act. He revised some details and put it through, which is what Hollande will do.  We continue to campaign against HADOPI, but its initial rejection was never presented as a big embarrassment for Sarkozy. Why the double standard? We must suspect that the right-wing media are spinning it.  04 January 2013 (Peru plans natural gas extraction)  Peru plans to extract natural gas from an area inhabited by isolated native peoples, which could wipe them out.  Burning the gas will contribute to wiping all of us out.  04 January 2013 (Obama will protect status quo)  Obama's New Year's Resolution: Protect the Status Quo.  04 January 2013 (Suicides of Israeli soldiers)  Israel covers up suicides of soldiers.  04 January 2013 (Diverting attention from annexation of West Bank)  "Debate" over a two-state solution is meant to divert attention from the real story: Israeli annexation of West Bank.  04 January 2013 (Hypocrisy of saying "I support our troops")  Michael Moore on the hypocrisy of saying "I support our troops".  When Bush invaded Iraq, an unjust war based on lies, I refused to consider the invasion forces as "our troops". They had started out as the US Army, but Bush had stolen them to use for his own vendetta, so I referred to them the Bush forces.  04 January 2013 (Campaign for labeling of GMOs)  The campaign for mandatory labeling of GMOs, defeated in California by misleading ads, now moves to Washington state and others.  04 January 2013 (Ban on sale of water in small plastic bottles)  Concord, Mass. has banned sale of water in plastic bottles of 1 liter or less.  It is a little drastic, but may be good overall, especially if the result is to make it easier to get a glass of water.  04 January 2013 (Dutch drug policy for foreigners)  A Dutch law banning foreigners from buying pot in "coffee shops" is not going to be enforced in Amsterdam, and maybe not the rest of the Netherlands either.  If the rest of Europe adopted the Dutch policy towards marijuana, the Netherlands would not need to be concerned about whether foreigners buy it.  04 January 2013 (Senators to investigate CIA's assistance to film)  US senators will investigate the CIA's assistance to the torture-legitimizing film Zero Dark Thirty.  04 January 2013 (A veil for unfair treatment of women)  Indians claim their culture reveres women, but that's merely a veil for unfair treatment.  Reverence as a front for mistreatment reminds me of the way pre-feminist "gentlemen" in America were supposed to treat "ladies".  04 January 2013 (Journalist Mauri K&ouml;nig in hiding)  Journalist Mauri K&ouml;nig is in hiding after he reported on corruption of the thugs in his city.  04 January 2013 (Nicklinson's right-to-die court case)  Tony Nicklinson's widow is continuing his right-to-die court case.  Most people have ways available to commit suicide if they really want to. Nicklinson's demand was only to have the same. Surely anyone who persistently says he wants to die ought to be given the chance. Put whatever safeguards you wish, to prevent people from being pressured into suicide; people in Nicklinson's situation would jump through any hoops, as long as this does not mean physically jumping.  04 January 2013 (Pedophilia)  There is little evidence to justify the widespread assumption that willing participation in pedophilia hurts children.  Granted, children may not dare say no to an older relative, or may not realize they could say no; in that case, even if they do not overtly object, the relationship may still feel imposed to them. That's not willing participation, it's imposed participation, a different issue.  04 January 2013 (Videos critical of Obama taken down)  Some videos on YouTube that criticize Obama have been taken down by the Committee for Public Safety (oops, I mean the Department of Homeland Security).  One of the videos is available on archive.org:  Has anyone found out what on grounds the government claims to do this?  04 January 2013 (Weakness of DR Congo's state)  The context of repeated Rwandan interventions to take the mineral wealth of DR Congo is the weakness of DR Congo's state, controlled by a man who rigged the last election.  It looks like Kabila runs the state for his own short-term enrichment, which ensures its weakness for anything else.  04 January 2013 (Aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy)  House Republican leadership backed down after public condemnation, and agreed to a vote on aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy.  Helping them is the state's duty, but it must not mean helping them rebuild where they surely will be flooded again. This flood was not a freak accident; in coming decades, it will happen over and over. The flooded areas will cease to be inhabited; the question is how much resources we will waste before yielding to the inevitable.  04 January 2013 (Handout to wealthy foreign businesses)  Can You Fight Poverty With a Five-Star Hotel?  The World Bank's activity is in effect a handout to wealthy foreign businesses.  04 January 2013 (Obama's assassination policy)  The ACLU's lawsuit to demand publication of Obama's assassination policy was defeated.  04 January 2013 (College web sites collect personal data)  Colleges' web sites invite students to enter personal data to get an estimate of the cost of attending that college. Lots of personal data.  04 January 2013 (China admits using organs from executed prisoners)  China admits using organs from executed prisoners for transplants. There is considerable evidence that Falun Gong prisoners have also been killed to get organs for transplant.  China says it will stop using organs from executed prisoners.  It looks like public pressure is working. We should keep up the pressure.  Some observers say they are not convinced China specifically targets Falun Gong prisoners; it could be that they simply make up a substantial fraction of the available prison population. I don't think this detail makes much difference to the ethical judgment of the practice.  04 January 2013 (Tax breaks for Hollywood and NASCAR)  The partial fiscal deal managed to extend tax breaks for profitable businesses such as Hollywood and NASCAR.  04 January 2013 (France's censorship demands to Twitter)  France's censorship demands to Twitter are more dangerous than "hate speech".  04 January 2013 (Annexation of West Bank)  Many Israeli politicians are calling for overt annexation of large parts of the West Bank (including the area near the Jordan River), in which Palestinians have been heavily oppressed for years; for instance, forbidden to build houses, wells, schools, etc.  03 January 2013 (Greek workers face retroactive wage cuts)  Greek workers will face retroactive wage cuts that will mean they are expected to keep working without pay. I suppose many will simply walk away and do something that might bring an income, such as begging.  The idea of "growth through austerity" is absurd, and the banksters knew this all along. It was a form of "shock capitalism", meant to enrich the banksters. The "successful" privatization campaign in Greece was part of the grab.  03 January 2013 (America's secret government)  America's secret government is ballooning into a giant complex, dwarfing what it was in the Cold War. It operates global war and assassination, and spies on all Americans just like Dubya's proposed "Total Information Awareness".  03 January 2013 (Torture)  Torture is not effective for getting information, but it can "work" if the goal is to destroy a person's mind.  03 January 2013 (History of China's great famine)  Writing the history of China's great famine, in which Mao killed 36 million people or perhaps 45 million.  03 January 2013 (Frequent, unpunished rape)  It's not only in India that rape is frequent, and frequently unpunished.  I am skeptical that the rape rate per capita is actually 4 times as much in England than in Delhi. It could be that the real rate is the same, but women in England are more likely to report the rape.  03 January 2013 (The Senate/Obama deal)  Although the Senate/Obama deal is not bad in itself, it shows that Obama will make concessions even where he holds all the good cards. This bodes ill for what will happen in two months, when the US government reaches the debt ceiling.  Clinton responded to a similar threat with courage: he let the Republicans shut down the government, and when they saw how much Americans loathed them for this, they gave in. The right thing for Obama to do is the same thing, but he is not one to fight for most Americans.  03 January 2013 (Resignation of EPA chief)  Has EPA chief Jackson quit because she knows that Obama plans to approve the planet-roaster pipeline?  03 January 2013 (Victory for contraception in the Philippines)  The victory for contraception in the Philippines came from advocating small families as good for the country as well as for the families themselves.  We need to do this in the US too. The US "choice" rhetoric is weak.  03 January 2013 (Positive thinking)  Positive thinking as such is ineffective, but you can change yourself to a certain extent by certain kinds of gestures.  If you wish you were more persistent in contributing to a worthy cause, such as free software for instance, working on the activity might put you in a more persistent frame of mind.  03 January 2013 (Abuse of what people post on Facebook)  Zuckerberg's sister is upset that a friend got a photo she had posted on Facebook and posted it elsewhere publicly.  As the article points out, abuse of what people post is the heart and soul of Facebook.  03 January 2013 (Rich elite descendants of China's communist leaders)  In China, the descendants of the eight principal communist leaders of 1976 have become the rich elite of corrupt capitalism.  02 January 2013 (Saudi Arabia punishes the poor)  Millions of poor people live in Saudi Arabia, but the state punishes people who show it.  The tremendous population growth is largely responsible, and that in turn is due to the patriarchal system that prevents women from limiting their births.  The poverty has the beneficial effect of protecting some children from Facebook, but that could be done in other ways.  02 January 2013 (Euro-austerity in Spain)  Euro-austerity is pushing Spain into lasting poverty.  02 January 2013 (Shell drill ship runs aground)  A Shell drill ship, being towed, broke loose in a storm and ran aground.  This particular accident caused no disaster, but it illustrates the tendency for accidents to happen in any operation at sea. It also shows that Shell's approach is based on tolerating a certain level of accidents rather than arranging for redundant safety measures. In some activities, that is rational and efficient, but not where one accident can cause a disaster.  02 January 2013 (The US seems to be adopting a deal)  The US seems to be adopting a deal that raises taxes on the rich (though not enough) and preserves the (already reduced) unemployment benefits.  This deal, as far as it goes, is pretty good. It does not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, for instance. However, Obama says he would like to reduce the deficit, which if done during a recession means a bigger recession.  Bush created the deficit expecting that it would later provide an excuse to cut government spending that helps people.  02 January 2013 (Church of Scientology harasses reporter)  A reporter tells how he was harassed by the Church of Scientology while investigating it.  02 January 2013 (Hostess' give-backs and thefts)  A former Hostess baker explains the give-backs and thefts that cut his wages by more than 50%, and convinced him and his fellow bakers that it was better to stand tall and make the company shut down than to surrender.  02 January 2013 (Cuts in unemployment insurance)  A series of cuts in unemployment insurance are driving tens of millions of Americans into poverty.  The article falls for the "fiscal cliff" myth, but there's no real cliff, not even in regard to unemployment insurance. Congress could retroactively extend unemployment insurance next week or next month. The problem is only that Republicans want to make Americans suffer.  02 January 2013 ("Extreme weather insurance")  Farmers in the UK want "extreme weather insurance." This is a pipe dream.  The idea of insurance is that the few who have bad luck are compensated by all the rest, who didn't. This spreads the cost to so many people that they can bear it.  Extreme weather is the face of global heating, and its costs will grow until they impoverish society. Using insurance to spread these costs will not make them bearable for long. We need to keep the costs down, by limiting CO2 emissions.  02 January 2013 (Abandoning the natural world)  2012: the year we did our best to abandon the natural world.  02 January 2013 (Putin represses small protests)  Even when a protest is small, Putin arrests the protesters.  In the US, small protests on the street are not usually repressed. Protests big enough to change something are the targets for repression.  02 January 2013 (Kidnap of political refugees from Ukraine)  Ukraine appears to be letting Russian, Israeli and Uzbek agents kidnap political refugees from Ukraine in order to torture them.  This resembles the US practice of  kidnaping people and torturing them, or giving them to Libya or Syria for torture.  02 January 2013 (US military spending)  How the US should cut military spending.  02 January 2013 (12 Republicrat lies about the US economy)  12 Republicrat lies about the US economy, its problems, and the solutions.  02 January 2013 (Liberia's land sold to logging companies)  1/4 of Liberia's land has been sold to logging companies, threatening devastating deforestation.  02 January 2013 (UK's Department of Energy)  Employees of fossil fuel companies work inside the UK's Department of Energy.  02 January 2013 (Sexual tyranny)  The Pope's meeting with the Ugandan politician that wants to kill gays is the culmination of an ever-escalating sexual tyranny.  01 January 2013 (Relief for Haitians made homeless by earthquake)  Relief for Haitians made homeless by the earthquake has wasted most of the money and done next to nothing for Haitians.  01 January 2013 (Egyptian activists protest gov't deal with Microsoft)  Egyptian activists protested a government deal with Microsoft and demanded free software.  Unfortunately, they seem to misunderstand the term "free software" and think that "free" means "gratis".  If someone in Egypt reads this, could you tell them that "free" in "free software" means "hurra"?  01 January 2013 (US whistleblowers targeted)  US Whistleblowers on Being Targeted by the Secret Security State.  01 January 2013 (Taliban use torture to obtain confessions)  The Taliban use torture to obtain confessions from suspected informers, then execute them.  I hope Americans are uncomfortable with how similar this is to the US.  01 January 2013 (Nationalist Japanese education)  The new Japanese prime minister and education minister want to make Japanese education more nationalist. They also deny that Japanese occupying troops forced women from the conquered peoples into prostitution.  The book Perawan Remaja dalam Cengkeraman Militer (Teenage Virgins in Military Camps), by Pramoedya Ananta Toer, describes how the Japanese invited bright Indonesian girls to travel to Japan for supposedly college, but actually took to them to various military bases outside Indonesia and forced them into prostitution. Those girls who survived were too ashamed to return to their families &mdash; which reflects the patriarchal cruelty of their own culture, but does not lessen the Japanese wrong.  From what I've read, history in Japan goes back around 1500 years; anything older is known only from archeology.  01 January 2013 (Haneen Zoabi can run again)  Israel's Supreme Court ruled that Haneen Zoabi can run again for the Knesset.  01 January 2013 (Israel's racist politician resigns)  Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's racist politician, resigned to face fraud charges.  01 January 2013 (Syria could end up like Somalia)  Syria could end up like Somalia if its civil war drags on.  01 January 2013 (2012 sets record for rain in England)  2012 set a record for rain in England.  Global heating leads to heavy rains and to severe droughts, sometimes alternating in the same place.  01 January 2013 (Vietnam's war on dissent)  Vietnam's war on dissent: bloggers are arrested, then prosecuted on bogus charges. Compare this with the US repression of Occupy. Thugs and corporations worked together nationwide to smash protests using physical attacks and bogus charges.  01 January 2013 (Resisting the Surveillance State)  Jacob Appelbaum on Resisting the Surveillance State.  01 January 2013 (Tornadoes from December snow storm)  Extreme weather caused by global heating extends into winter, as a big snow storm's tornadoes set a record for Dec 25.  01 January 2013 (The Idle No More movement)  The Idle No More movement of Canada's indigenous people is important to everyone, because indigenous people's legal resistance can stop devastating plans, such as dangerous pipelines to export shale oil.  The right-wing government's attempt to weaken the treaties that they depend on is what sparked the movement.  01 January 2013 (Imprisonment without trial)  Congress is on track to reapprove imprisonment without trial of absolutely anyone, and Obama won't help, but a court case is challenging the constitutionality of this law.  01 January 2013 (No change from Obama)  Many liberals hoped and believed that Obama would become progressive in his second term.  They should have voted for Jill Stein.  01 January 2013 (Urgent: Call on FDA not to approve GMO salmon)  US citizens: call on the FDA not to approve GMO salmon, which has not been adequately tested.  31 December 2012 (Made for You)   Made for You  30 December 2012 (Dissidents sentenced to prison after sham trials)  Cambodian dissidents are sentenced to prison after sham trials.  The US could set a good example if it ceased using bogus trials (as in Guantanamo) and imprisonment without trial.  30 December 2012 (Ireland's environmental taxes)  In Ireland, environmental taxes have caused big reductions in trash and CO2 emissions.  The quoted complaint, "what's being done with [the money] to help the environment," misses the point. The environment is helped by the incentive created by the tax, which is independent of how the money is spent.  30 December 2012 (NRA blocking global treaty)  The NRA is blocking the global treaty to control the international trade in handguns and rifles.  30 December 2012 (Modern replacement for magic: shopping)  Regarding shopping as a modern replacement for magic.  I don't need to agree with Christianity or Judaism to agree with this article's point.  30 December 2012 (Wages need to be increased)  A small increase in taxes for the rich will not give most Americans a decent life. We need to increase wages.  29 December 2012 (Letter from Chinese worker)  Halloween decorations from Sears/Kmart came with a letter from a worker telling about his prison conditions in China.  Of course, the company says that such production is against its rules, but these companies don't try very hard to enforce such rules.  The labor camps in China are often used as political prisons.  29 December 2012 (Congress renews secret electronic snooping bill)  The US Congress has made a monkey of the 4th amendment by renewing the secret electronic snooping bill without the slightest safeguard for Americans' rights.  29 December 2012 (Koch brothers bully Congress)  The Koch brothers are bullying Congress into opposing relief for victims of hurricane Sandy.  The Koch brothers deserve the hatred of every American, but we should not let that distract us from what needs to be done. We need to change our political system so that rich people can't have so much influence. And we need to tax them more heavily for all their income, including capital gains.  29 December 2012 (US health care system)  The US has the most expensive health care system in the world, but it delivers less than other advanced countries' systems do.  29 December 2012 (Wireless wiretapping reauthorized)  Obama and Senate Republicans, helped by anti-human-right Democrats such as Feinstein, voted to reauthorize wireless wiretapping, and used the same fascist arguments that Cheney and Nixon used.  29 December 2012 (Guantanamo)  The US has used Guantanamo as a legal black hole for over 20 years with different groups of people.  29 December 2012 (China imposes "real names" policy on Internet users)  China has imposed a "real names" policy on Internet users. This is obviously for purposes of oppression, and that should make people see injustice in services such as Facebook and Google+ that demand people's real names.  29 December 2012 (People in UK arrested for insult)  People in the UK have been arrested for leaving a pig's head outside a Muslim community center in England.  This was a crude and nasty way of expressing what they thought of Muslims' views. However, there are worse ways of criticizing someone's views: for instance, to arrest people for expressing them. The pig head was not a threat, just an insult, and insults must not be a crime.  29 December 2012 (Airline fares)  Airlines want to charge different fares for different people, based on a wide variety of personal information, and keep the price hidden until possible buyers jump through a lot of hoops.  29 December 2012 (Imprisonment without trial)  Republican senators are not satisfied with voting for imprisonment without trial; they want to argue for it in the Supreme Court too.  29 December 2012 (Thugs attack anti-rape protests in India)  Across India, thugs have attacked anti-rape protests as well as the journalists who cover them.  29 December 2012 (Big business money corrupting scientific research)  Big business money is corrupting scientific research in many fields, including agriculture and fracking &mdash; not just pharmaceuticals.  To fix this, we need to tax rich people and businesses more so that the state can find this research.  29 December 2012 (US veterans not getting needed support)  US veterans have to wait months for pensions and disability benefits; often they die first. Some of them commit suicide because they don't get the support they need.  29 December 2012 (Saying someone "has no balls" in Italy now a crime)  In Italy it is a crime to say that someone "has no balls".  I will say something much stronger and more harsh: Italy has no human rights.  29 December 2012 (Wal-Mart in Mexico)  Wal-Mart in Mexico was an "aggressive and creative corruptor".  29 December 2012 (Syrian rebels fight each other over loot)  Many Syrian rebels are fighting each other over loot.  29 December 2012 (Thatcher's secret proposal)  Thatcher promised to preserve the UK's National Health Service, then proposed in secret to replace it with a system of US-style insurance.  The current Tory government is more subtle: destroying the NHS slowly by underfunding it and "reforming" it.  29 December 2012 (TEPCO cannot pay damages for Fukushima meltdowns)  TEPCO cannot pay the damages for the Fukushima meltdowns, which are now estimated at 38 billion dollars.  29 December 2012 (Egyptian women protest against new constitution)  Egyptian women protested in Tahrir Square against the new constitution.  29 December 2012 (Brutal Bahraini regime's US support)  Zainab al-Khawaja calls on the US to stop supporting the brutal Bahraini regime.  29 December 2012 (Feds pollute water to mine uranium)  On a Wyoming Ranch, Feds Sacrifice Tomorrow's Water to Mine Uranium Today.  28 December 2012 (UK considers punishing customers of prostitutes)  The UK is considering punishing the customers of prostitutes, which would do harm to prostitutes and their clients, and help no one.  The root of this campaign is the labeling of prostitution as "violence", a twisted half-truth.  Some prostitutes choose that line of work and are happy to profit from it. Whatever they are, they are not victims of violence. Others are forced to be prostitutes, often by means of violence (actual and threatened) by traffickers and pimps. The violence they suffer and fear is not metaphorical; it is not another word for sex with their clients. This violence consists of beatings, kidnaping, imprisonment, and sometimes even worse.  The government's mission ought to be to assure that those who wish to be prostitutes can do it safely, while those who wish not to be prostitutes can avoid it safely.  What makes it difficult for someone to avoid being a prostitute? If it is violence and threats from a pimp, offer shelter. If it is kidnaping and enslavement, offer escape. If it is poverty, offer another option. Austerity, in the UK and the Euro zone, has surely convinced tens of thousands to reluctantly become prostitutes.  28 December 2012 (Nuclear facility ill-equipped to handle accident)  A safety drill at the Sellafield (formerly called Windscale) nuclear facility showed that its resources for responding to an accident were grossly inadequate.  28 December 2012 (Judge Afiuni denied exercise and medical care)  Judge Afiuni, awaiting trial in Venezuela, has been denied exercise and medical care.  While this is not as extreme as what the US did to Bradley Manning, it is nonetheless wrong.  Noam Chomsky has called on Chavez to free her on humanitarian grounds because she has cancer.  Granting bail to the businessman Cede&ntilde;o seems foolish, and since a judge could hardly have failed to realize he might flee, it generates the suspicion that he corrupted Judge Afiuni. I don't know what other evidence there is against her, but the charges against her seem plausible.  28 December 2012 (Hamas suppresses journalists)  Hamas has ordered Palestinian journalists in Gaza not to give reports to Israeli media.  I think this is both wrong and harmful.  28 December 2012 (MDMA shows promise for treating PTSD)  MDMA ("ecstacy") shows promise for treating PTSD, and did not seem to do any harm to the patients.  It is quite possible for the drug to be safe when used in one controlled way, and dangerous when used in other ways (perhaps with higher doses).  28 December 2012 (Urgent: Ban sale of lion meat)  US citizens: call for a ban on sale of lion meat in the US.  28 December 2012 (Senior Al Jazeera journalist quits)  A senior Al Jazeera journalist has quit, denouncing political slant imposed by Qatar.  28 December 2012 (Control over US major media)  Just 6 companies control most of the US major media, and the FCC wants to reduce that even more.  28 December 2012 (5-year prison sentence for protesting)  Li Yiqian, who campaigned against diversion of funds for repair after the Sichuan earthquake, has been sentenced to 5 years in prison for a crime which consists essentially of protesting.  The UK also has a crime, "aggravated trespass", which consists  essentially of protesting.  28 December 2012 (Hamas war crimes)  Human Rights Watch has condemned Hamas rocket attacks against Israel. The fact that Israel carries out war crimes against Gaza does not excuse Gazans to carry out war crimes against Israel.  28 December 2012 (Two species of seal receive legal protection)  Two species of seals have been given legal protection because global heating is expected to be devastating to their way of life.  28 December 2012 (If you bought it, you should own it)  First Sale Under Siege: If You Bought It, You Should Own It.  28 December 2012 (Morsi signs Islamist Egyptian constitution)  Morsi signed the Islamist Egyptian constitution, approved by 21% of the eligible voters.  28 December 2012 (Obama trying to make bad budget deal)  Obama continues trying doggedly to make a bad budget deal.  Paul Krugman explains why nothing much will happen on Jan 1 in the absence of a deal, because the real effects are longer-term, and why it is better to wait till after Jan 1 to address them.  28 December 2012 (Video game companies marketing real weapons)  Video game companies are marketing real weapons.  28 December 2012 (Using surveillance drones to spot rhino poachers)  Using surveillance drones to spot rhino poachers.  28 December 2012 (US drone strikes that killed civilians)  Yemen's government cooperates with the US to deny US drone strikes that killed civilians.  Hitting the wrong target is a kind of accident that tends to happen from time to time in war. There is no way to completely avoid it. When the people support the war, they recognize this and sustain the accidents. When they don't support the war, they don't.  28 December 2012 (Noam Chomsky: America, Moral Degenerate)  Noam Chomsky: America, Moral Degenerate.  I think his evaluation of Libya exaggerates the negative, but the rest seems valid.  28 December 2012 (Nanotechnology strangled by patents)  Nanotechnology is being strangled by patents.  The article uses the term "open source" in a confusing way, very different from "open source software". Of course, I am not a supporter of "open source software" and never was, but I still don't like to see people distorting its meaning.  The article also uses the confusing term "intellectual property", equating it to "patents". The confusion is because another article you read tomorrow will say "intellectual property", except it means copyrights. And another you read next week will say "intellectual property", except it means trade secrets. Each of the articles would have been clearer if it had avoided that term.  28 December 2012 (Israel accelerates construction in the West Bank)  Israel is accelerating the construction of colonies in the West Bank, and Netanyahu is considering admitting that he is against a future Palestinian state in principle.  27 December 2012 (Privacy Battle)   Don't Surrender the Privacy Battle.  27 December 2012 (Urgent: Oppose bad fiscal deal)  US citizens: sign this petition saying a bad fiscal deal is worse than no deal.  27 December 2012 (Childhood suffering)  Why do certain rock stars die young? Childhood suffering, which may have driven them to seek fame, also makes them susceptible to drug addiction and other medical problems.  In a world with a smaller, stable population, and fewer children, we could protect all children from many of the causes of suffering.  27 December 2012 (Hollywood film glorifies torture)  In the film Zero Dark Thirty, inside the false claims that torture helped the US find Osama bin Laden is the message that torture can be beautiful.  I am not going to watch it to "judge this for myself". That's precisely what the film-makers and the CIA want us to do. Don't be lured by them; join me in shunning it.  27 December 2012 (Afghan gov't agent shoots US soldier)  Another armed Afghan government agent shot a US soldier, but the only reason it's news is that the shooter was a woman.  27 December 2012 (Kidnaped Burmese women forced into slavery)  Women in Burma are kidnapped and taken to other countries where they are forced to work as slaves.  27 December 2012 (Public inquiry into torture in Iraq)  The UK must hold a public inquiry into systematic torture in Iraq.  Otherwise it will continue to pretend that it was just a few "bad apples", while refusing to punish most of them.  27 December 2012 (Web site editor faces death penalty)  Saudi Arabia: Website Editor Facing Death Penalty.  27 December 2012 (US and Russia agree on attacking people who share)  The US and Russia are at odds on most issues, but agreed to cooperate in attacking people who share.  27 December 2012 (West Antarctica warming faster)  West Antarctica is warming twice as fast as was thought.  27 December 2012 (Islamist Egyptian constitution supposedly approved)  Supposedly the Islamist Egyptian constitution was approved, but only 30% voted and the opposition says the election was not honest.  27 December 2012 (FBI's investigation of Occupy Wall Street)  The FBI investigated Occupy Wall Street as "Domestic Terrorists, Criminals" even before its protests began.  Occupy showed what democracy looks like. The US showed what the first levels of repression look like.  27 December 2012 (UN plays arsonist and fireman)  The UN is playing arsonist and fireman in Haiti.  27 December 2012 (Don't scapegoat Nancy Lanza)  Don't scapegoat Nancy Lanza for her son's murder spree.  We don't know enough to conclude that she did something wrong.  27 December 2012 (Thugs attack protests in Delhi)  Protests in Delhi demanding action against rape were attacked by the thugs.  The idea of the death penalty for rape is a foolish one, as well unjust (since execution is always unjust). The problem in India is that rape is usually not punished at all. Increasing the theoretical penalty would make little difference; the death penalty is not a better deterrent. What India needs to do is make punishment likely.  27 December 2012 (Pervasive corruption of large banks)  Large banks have become so pervasively corrupt that large fines are merely a cost of doing business.  A little tinkering can't fix this. Banks need to be restructured so that they are limited to simpler operations in which corruption is not a possibility.  26 December 2012 (Dividing Bethlehem from Jerusalem)  New Israeli colonies are designed to divide Bethlehem from Jerusalem.  The annexation wall already separates them.  26 December 2012 (Fake anti-malaria drugs in Africa)  Up to 1/3 of anti-malaria drugs in parts of Africa are fake.  26 December 2012 (UK wants to deny torture victims compensation)  The UK is looking for a technicality to avoid paying compensation to torture victims in Kenya.  26 December 2012 (End-of-the-world prophecies)  Sanal Edamaruku on previous end-of-the-world prophecies.  26 December 2012 (Oakland fires city employees to pay Raiders football team)  Oakland fired city employees so it could keep paying the Raiders football team to stay in that city.  "Raiders" may be an appropriate name for them.  The thugs who were fired may have attacked protesters in 2011. Perhaps with fewer thugs, Oakland will have more democracy. However, that doesn't invalidate the main point: that we must stop businesses from playing US cities and states against each other.  26 December 2012 (Freedom of expression in Turkey)  European Human Rights Court Finds Tur
